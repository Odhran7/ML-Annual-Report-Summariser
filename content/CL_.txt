our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration the rapid growth of ecommerce the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and ecommerce retailers products similar to those that we produce and sell are available from multinational and local competitors in the us and overseas certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do in addition the substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models in certain geographies we also face strong local competitors who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products 

the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications and the increased presence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtoconsumer businesses these trends have accelerated during the covid19 pandemic at the same time during the covid19 pandemic we have experienced disruptions in certain channels including travel retail we also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers including the nature andor frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental veterinary and skin health professionals as well as a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online we face competition in several aspects of our business including pricing promotional activities new product and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels product quality innovation brand recognition marketing capability and acceptance of new products and brands largely determine success in colgate’s operating segments

covid19 

covid19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live work interact and shop and have significantly impacted and may continue to impact economic activity around the world 

during the covid19 pandemic many of the communities in which we manufacture market and sell our products experienced and in some cases continue to experience “stay at home” orders travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 and have implemented varying policies to address the pandemic resume economic activity and vaccinate their populations because the vast majority of our products such as oral care products soaps and other personal hygiene products home cleaners and pet food have been deemed essential for the health and wellbeing of people and their pets we have in most instances been able to continue operating our business although not always at full capacity in doing so the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority in addition some of our suppliers customers distributors logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses 

we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories such as liquid hand soap dish liquid bar soap and cleaners during 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic driven by consumer pantryloading and increased consumption of our products while consumer demand for most of these categories declined yearoveryear in 2021 most remained above historical levels and we believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to covid19 across our business changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category and geography depending on among other things the severity of the covid19 outbreak the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions 

the covid19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers’ ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products while we believe that in the longterm consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong uncertainties continue surrounding the timing and duration of the pandemic and the recovery from it covid19 has also disrupted our retail customers contract manufacturers logistics providers and other third parties their ability to address covid19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products in particular covid19 has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the travel retail channel we expect the ongoing economic impact health concerns associated with covid19 and supply chain disruptions to continue to impact consumer behavior shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022

sustainability 

we view sustainability as being critically important to our overall business and growth strategy in november 2020 we announced our 2025 sustainability  social impact strategy focusing on three key ambitions — preserving our environment by accelerating action on climate change and reducing our environmental footprint helping millions of homes by empowering people to develop healthier habits and driving social impact with a commitment to helping to ensure the wellbeing of all people and their pets these ambitions are supported by actionable targets consistent with our continued commitment to building environmental and social consciousness into our decisionmaking 

in 2021 we made progress on the targets set forth in our 2025 sustainability  social impact strategy 

reduce plastic waste as a positive step toward achieving our targets to reduce the use of new plastic by a third and make our packaging 100 recyclable reusable or compostable by 2025 we are working to implement our firstofitskind recyclable toothpaste tube across our toothpaste portfolio we also launched colgate keep our firstofitskind manual toothbrush with a replaceable head and a reusable aluminum handle for 80 less plastic waste compared to similarly sized colgate toothbrushes 

accelerate action on climate change and conserve water to support our goal to become net zero carbon in our operations by 2040 we have built renewable energy roadmaps at each of our operational sites across the world and have engaged all of our tier 1 suppliers in support of our goal to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 30 versus 2018 with our save water campaign we estimate that our consumers have contributed to an avoidance of approximately 206 billion gallons of water and 108 million metric tons of co2 emissions since its launch in 2016

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks some of which have occurred andor are occurring and any of which could occur in the future are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of these risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

business and industry risks 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70 of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

• changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets including as a result of inflation volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials labor energy and logistics 

• political or economic instability geopolitical events environmental events widespread health emergencies such as covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics natural disasters or social or labor unrest 

• changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows from nonus markets or increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets 

• exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product including as a result of covid19 or to repatriate earnings from overseas 

• lack of wellestablished reliable andor impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual intellectual property or other legal rights 

• foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources and 

• changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of andor the increase in onerous trade restrictions andor tariffs sanctions price controls labor laws travel or immigration restrictions including as a result of covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics profit controls or other government controls 

any or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings 

in addition there continue to be uncertainties related to the united kingdom’s exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as brexit including the longterm impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the united kingdom and the eu the “euuk trade and cooperation agreement” these uncertainties include the impact of the euuk trade and cooperation agreement on businesses in the eu and the united kingdom and how the new relationship between the eu and the united kingdom will develop over time including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound andor the euro and disruptions to our workforce and that of 

our suppliers and business partners we do not however believe brexit has had or will have a material impact on our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

furthermore the imposition of tariffs andor increase in tariffs on various products by the united states and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries and new andor increased tariffs have subjected and may continue in the future to subject us to additional costs and expenditure of resources major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the united states andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which in turn could have a material effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do in addition the substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models 

we face competition in several aspects of our business including pricing promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on or have more effective advertising and promotional activities than we do introduce competing products more quickly andor respond more effectively to business and economic conditions and changing consumer preferences including by launching innovative new products such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our success is increasingly dependent on our ability to effectively leverage digital technology and data analytics to gain new commercial insights and develop relevant marketing and advertising to reach customers and consumers in addition during the covid19 pandemic we have experienced and may continue to experience elevated demand for some of our products as compared to prepandemic levels our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property including patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape and changing consumer preferences may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and ecommerce retailers with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation the rapid growth of ecommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers and some of these retailers have and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than we do they have used and may continue to use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances slotting fees or increased investment including through display media paid search preparation fees and coop programs which have led to and could continue to lead to reduced sales or profitability in certain markets the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our customers see “distribution raw materials competition trademarks and patents” in item 1 “business” 

we also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking fulfillment requirements limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products or environmental sustainability supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives for example a determination 

by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or that our packaging does not comply with certain environmental supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition “private label” products sold by our retail customers which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our products 

further the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications and the increased presence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtocustomer dtc businesses these trends accelerated during the covid19 pandemic the rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures andor adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers if we are not successful in continuing to adapt or to effectively react to changes in consumer preferences purchasing patterns and market dynamics andor expanding sales through ecommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels including the profitable expansion of our own dtc capabilities our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products the successful identification development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories channels of distribution or geographies our ability to launch new products to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully 

• identify develop and fund technological innovations 

• obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others 

• obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products including from the fda and other regulatory bodies in the us and abroad and 

• anticipate and quickly respond to the needs and preferences of consumers and customers 

the identification development and introduction of innovative new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable costs and effort and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace 

our ability to quickly innovate to adapt and market our products and to adapt our packaging to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy the failure to develop and launch successful new products or to adapt our packaging and supply chain to meet such preferences could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

if in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products 

we face various risks related to pandemics epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we face various risks related to pandemics epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns including the covid19 pandemic a pandemic epidemic or similar widespread health concern could have and covid19 has had and will continue to have a variety of impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition including 

• our ability to continue to maintain and support the health safety and wellbeing of our employees including key employees 

• disruptions to our global supply chain including the closure of manufacturing and distribution facilities due to among other things the lack of availability of raw and packaging materials or manufacturing components a decrease in our workforce or in the efficiency of such workforce including as a result of illness travel restrictions absenteeism or governmental regulations transportation and logistics challenges including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions or volume and capacity restraints or the impact of covid19 on our retailers third party suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers or distributors 

• volatility in the demand for and availability of our products which may be caused by the temporary inability of our consumers to purchase our products due to illness financial hardship quarantine government actions mandating the closure of our facilities which impacted some of our production facilities in asia in 2021 distributors or retailers andor imposing travel or movement restrictions shifts in demand and consumption away from more discretionary or higher priced products to lowerpriced products or pantryloading activity 

• changes in purchasing patterns of our consumers including the nature andor frequency of instore visits by consumers to retailers and dental veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift to purchasing our products online and disruptions in certain channels including travel retail 

• significant volatility in demand for certain of our products which may require us to increase our production capacity or acquire additional capacity at an additional cost and expense 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our retailers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers customers commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties 

• significant changes in the economic and political conditions of the markets in which we operate which could restrict and have restricted our employees’ ability to work and travel could mandate and have mandated or caused the closure of certain distributors or retailers our offices shared business service centers andor operating and manufacturing facilities or otherwise could prevent and have prevented us as well as our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the manufacture distribution sale and support of our products 

• disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets which may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital andor 

• volatility in foreign exchange rates and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials and transportation and logistics costs 

despite our efforts to manage these impacts their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration severity and geographic scope of an outbreak such as covid19 including the emergence and spread of covid19 variants the availability distribution acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain its spread and mitigate its public health and economic effects each of which is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict furthermore these and other impacts of covid19 could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included in this item 1a “risk factors” for additional information regarding how covid19 has affected or is expected to affect our business refer to 

part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview” 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance dei sustainability and social impact brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives negative publicity about us our brands our products our supply chain our ingredients our packaging our environmental social and governance “esg” practices including as they relate to sustainability dei or our employees whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation such negative publicity could relate to among other things health concerns threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings environmental impact including deforestation packaging plastic energy and water use and waste management our esg practices or our sustainability targets in addition the proliferation of digital and social media has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination and the potential for negative publicity negative publicity posts or comments on digital and social media about us our brands our products our sustainability efforts our environmental and social impact including our packaging or our employees whether true or untrue could damage our brands and our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations compliance and esg practices thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

our success depends upon our ability to recruit attract and retain key employees including through the implementation of diversity equity and inclusion initiatives and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to recruit attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected successfully executing organizational change including management transitions at leadership levels of the company and succession plans for senior management is critical to our business success while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time further changes in immigration laws and government policies including related to the covid19 pandemic have made in certain circumstances and may continue to make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical professional and management personnel to meet our business needs our ability to attract and retain talent has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market particularly in the united states which is experiencing wage inflation labor shortages a shift toward remote work and the effects of covid19 in addition we also continue to work to advance culture change through the implementation of dei initiatives throughout our organization we are also implementing new ways of working to among other things instill a growth mindset to drive innovation with focus empowerment experimentation and digitization if we do not or are perceived not to successfully implement these initiatives our ability to recruit attract and retain talent may be adversely impacted 

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures which could adversely impact our business 

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands businesses assets or technologies from third parties acquisitions and their pursuit have involved and can involve numerous potential risks including among other things 

• realizing the full extent of the expected benefits or synergies as a result of a transaction within the anticipated time frame or at all 

• successfully integrating the operations technologies services products and systems of the acquired brands assets or businesses in an effective timely and costefficient manner 

• receiving necessary consents clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction 

• diverting management’s attention from other business priorities 

• successfully operating in new lines of business channels of distribution or markets 

• achieving distribution expansion related to products categories and markets 

• retaining key employees partners suppliers and customers of the acquired business 

• conforming standards controls procedures and policies of the acquired business with our own 

• developing or launching products with acquired technologies and 

• other unanticipated problems or liabilities 

moreover acquisitions have resulted in and could in the future result in substantial additional debt the assumption of contingent liabilities such as litigation or earnout obligations or transaction costs in addition to the extent that the economic benefits associated with an acquisition or investment diminish in the future or the performance of an acquired company or business is less robust than expected we may be required to record additional impairments of intangible assets including trademarks and goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2021 we took a noncash aftertax impairment charge of 518 million to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and a trade name intangible asset related to the filorga skin health business any of these risks could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we have divested and may in the future periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

operational risks 

our business results are impacted by our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain andor key office facilities 

we are engaged in the manufacture and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale our operations and those of our suppliers contract manufacturers or logistics providers have been and may continue to be disrupted by a number of factors including but not limited to 

• environmental events 

• widespread health emergencies such as covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics 

• strikes and other labor disputes 

• disruptions in logistics 

• loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites 

• loss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers 

• supplier capacity constraints 

• raw material and product quality or safety issues 

• industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues 

• the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets 

• the lack of availability of qualified personnel such as truck drivers and production labor 

• governmental incentives and controls including import and export restrictions such as new or increased tariffs sanctions quotas or trade barriers and 

• natural disasters including climatic events including any potential effects of climate change and earthquakes acts of war or terrorism political unrest or uncertainty fires or explosions cybersecurity incidents and other external factors over which we have no control 

in addition we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from singlesource suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental andor colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time if our existing or new suppliers fail to meet such standards or if we are unable to contract with suppliers on favorable terms our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we believe that the supplies of raw and packaging materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate in addition we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers and the supply of raw and packaging materials nonetheless a significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason including those mentioned above have at times interrupted and could in the future interrupt product supply and if not remedied could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition as a result of our global shared service organizational model certain of our functions such as finance and accounting customer service and logistics human resources global information technology and data analytics are concentrated in key office facilities a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason including those mentioned above could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as essential oils resins tropical oils pulp tallow corn poultry and soybeans are subject to market price variations increases in the costs of andor a reduction in the availability of commodities energy and logistics including trucks and containers and other necessary services including during the covid19 pandemic have affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our profit margins inflationary pressures have also increased and may continue to increase the cost of such commodities and services if commodity and other cost increases continue in the future and we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases we may not be able to sustain the price increases also sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may 

decide not to pay higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition see “our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain andor key office facilities” above for additional information 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

one way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization which we refer to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials among other things the achievement of our fundingthegrowth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our fundingthegrowth initiatives our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected any failure to implement our fundingthegrowth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our fundingthegrowth initiatives refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview” 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2022 global productivity initiative  

on january 27 2022 the board approved a targeted productivity program the “2022 global productivity initiative” the program is intended to reallocate resources toward our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs the successful implementation of the program may present organizational challenges and in some cases may require successful negotiations with third parties as a result we may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the 2022 global productivity initiative events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable in addition changes in foreign exchange rates or in tax labor or immigration laws may result in our not achieving the anticipated cost savings as measured in us dollars if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings from the 2022 global productivity initiative our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2022 global productivity initiative in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding the 2022 global productivity initiative refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – restructuring and related implementation charges” 

a cybersecurity incident data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems “it systems” including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties including cloudbased service providers and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited to

although we have a broad array of information security measures in place our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups individuals and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion social engineering password theft or introduction of viruses or malware such as ransomware through phishing emails we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers is securely maintained data leakages due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur furthermore we periodically upgrade our it systems or adopt new technologies if such an upgrade or new technology does not function as designed does not go as planned or increases our exposure to a cyberattack or cyber incident it may adversely impact our business including our ability to ship products to customers issue invoices and process payments or order raw and packaging materials although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cybersecurity incidents we have experienced to date if we suffer a significant loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted or otherwise we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations litigation fines andor damages which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition while we currently maintain insurance coverage that subject to its terms and conditions is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cybersecurity incidents and it system failures this insurance coverage may not depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident or the damage to our business reputation or brands that may result from an incident 

furthermore while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place if our it systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance of failure of or cyberattack on thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages cybersecurity breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation any of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

climate change and other sustainability matters could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and its impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition specifically 

the predicted effects of climate change may exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water and other ingredients in addition the increased concern over climate change is likely to result in new or additional legal and regulatory requirements intended to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment and may relate to among other things greenhouse gas emissions eg carbon pricing alternative energy policy and additional disclosure obligations such additional regulation may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition by increasing our compliance and manufacturing costs andor negatively impacting our reputation if we are unable to or are perceived whether or not valid not to satisfy such requirements despite our sustainability efforts any failure to achieve our sustainability targets including those aimed to reduce our impact on improve or preserve the environment or the perception whether or not valid that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation there is also increased focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations investors customers consumers our employees and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters including responsible sourcing and deforestation the use of plastic energy and water the recyclability or recoverability of packaging including singleuse and other plastic packaging and a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients and ingredient transparency our reputation could be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities around the world review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products while we monitor and seek to mitigate the impact of any emerging information a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide antibribery laws including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and laws that prohibit commercial bribery we are also subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us including without limitation those imposed by ofac andor by other jurisdictions that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted while our policies mandate compliance with these laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees joint venture partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business findings that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations have subjected us to and could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is 

unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the cost of responding to such a claim including management time and outofpocket expenses and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation brand image and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories we are and may continue to be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings including disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment pension data privacy and security environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or an ingredient contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe or have a quality issue we have had to and may in the future need to withdraw recall or reformulate some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a withdrawal recall or reformulation is required or advisable such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image the resolution of or increase in the reserves taken in connection with one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for that period see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings

disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets interest rate increases changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that are expected to replace the london interbank offered rate libor or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements such as interest rate foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain 

interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live work interact and shop and have significantly impacted and continue to impact economic activity around the world we have a wellestablished crisis management team “cmt” process and the cmt together with our senior management team and colgate people around the world continue to respond to and manage the challenges presented by covid19 

during the covid19 pandemic many of the communities in which we manufacture market and sell our products experienced and in some cases continue to experience “stay at home” orders travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 and have implemented varying policies to address the pandemic resume economic activity and vaccinate their populations the situation continues to be uncertain and varies by geography as the impact of covid19 remains significant in many countries throughout the world including brazil china india mexico thailand the us and vietnam where we have substantial manufacturing facilities because the vast majority of our products such as oral care products soaps and other personal hygiene products home cleaners and pet food have been deemed essential for the health and wellbeing of people and their pets we have in most instances been able to continue operating our business although not always at full capacity 

the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority while we have reopened most of our offices in some instances on a limited and voluntary basis many of our officebased employees globally continue to work from home we have implemented additional health and safety measures consistent with government recommendations andor requirements to help ensure employee safety in our offices production facilities warehouses and technology centers often at additional cost these measures may include health and temperature screening social distancing and personal protective equipment protocols hand washing contact tracing enhanced cleaning procedures respiratory hygiene education and in some instances testing andor vaccination requirements in addition during the covid19 pandemic we have seen increased instances of absenteeism and in some cases we have experienced some limited production facility closures and related supply chain disruptions furthermore some of our suppliers customers distributors logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses 

we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories such as liquid hand soap dish liquid bar soap and cleaners during 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic driven by consumer pantryloading and increased consumption of our products while consumer demand for most of these categories declined yearoveryear in 2021 most still remained above historical levels and we believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to covid19 across our business changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category channel and geography depending on among other things the severity of the covid19 outbreak the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions at the same time during the covid19 pandemic we have experienced disruptions in certain channels including travel retail we also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers including the nature andor frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online 

covid19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers’ ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products while we believe that in the longterm consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong uncertainties continue surrounding the covid19 pandemic these uncertainties include the impact of the timing and scale of changes to travel and movement restrictions in certain geographies the availability and widespread distribution and use of covid19 vaccines the emergence and spread of covid19 variants the timing and impact of consumer pantryloading and destocking activity in certain markets product demand trends and the impact of covid19 on the global economy including as a result of inflation and supply chain disruptions covid19 has also disrupted our retail customers contract manufacturers logistics providers and other third parties their ability to address covid19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products we expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with covid19 to continue to impact consumer behavior shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022 

while we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees and third parties uncertainty resulting from covid19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business including our global supply chain and retailer network andor require us to incur additional operational costs

we are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus empowerment experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers the retail landscape the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation 

the investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through these initiatives which are referred to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials among other things and encompass a wide range of projects examples of which include raw material substitution reduction of packaging materials consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification we also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our oral care personal care and pet nutrition businesses including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health

outlook 

looking forward we expect global macroeconomic political and market conditions to remain challenging especially due to covid19 during the year ended december 31 2021 all of our divisions experienced significantly higher raw and packaging material costs we also incurred increased logistics costs due to volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry and higher ecommerce demand we expect this difficult cost environment to continue in 2022 

while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion 

we have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets such as inventory destocking fulfillment requirements limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products and certain environmental sustainability supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives in addition the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of ecommerce changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications and the increased presence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtoconsumer businesses these trends have been magnified due to covid19 in many of our geographies and we plan to continue to invest behind our digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses such as ecommerce this rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures andor adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers 

in addition given that approximately 70 of our net sales originate in markets outside the us we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations as discussed above we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material and logistics costs while we have taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions such as the 2022 global productivity initiative and our funding the growth and revenue growth management initiatives including additional pricing in the current environment it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies should these conditions persist they could adversely affect our future results

in summary we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition broad based experience operating in challenging environments resilient global supply chain and focused business strategy our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and longterm profitable growth through innovation within our core businesses leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories expanding in highgrowth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency we are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital including our sustainability and social impact and dei strategies our commitment to these priorities the strength of our brands the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges presented by covid19 and increase shareholder value over time

managing foreign currency interest rate commodity price and credit risk exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see “results of operations” above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward and swap contracts option contracts foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of 12 and net unrealized loss of 11 at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2021 an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 76 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the company utilizes forwardstarting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2021 variable rate debt levels a 1 increase in interest rates would have increased interest income expense net by 14 in 2021 

the company is assessing the impact of the discontinuation of libor as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements including debt outstanding and believes it will not be material as the company does not have significant exposure to libor in either its debt or other financing arrangements the company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods 

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as essential oils resins tropical oils pulp tallow corn poultry and soybeans the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the hill ’ s pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

the company’s open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of 2 an d 3 at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively at the end of 2021 an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 1 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company’s policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs 

▪ the company accounts for inventories using both the firstin firstout  “ fifo ”  method 75 of inventories and the lastin firstout  “ lifo ”  method 25 of inventories there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2021 or 2020 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 

▪ shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses the company accounts for such costs primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight as fulfillment costs and reports them in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling general and administrative expenses accordingly the company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales if such costs had been included as a component of cost of sales the company’s gross profit margin would have been lower by 968 bps in 2021 by 845 bps in 2020 and 810 bps in 2019 with no impact on reported earnings 

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances legal and other contingency reserves 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

▪ in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for us defined benefit plans was 298 and 265 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans was 306 and 288 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively discount rates used for the us and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for us plans was 570 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 in determining the expected longterm rate of return the company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return 

average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 3 8 8 6 and 7 respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 76 in fixed income securities 21 in equity securities and 3 in real estate and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 18 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans and us other retiree benefit plan would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 2 and 10 respectively a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected longterm rate of return this rate was 350 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans 

▪ the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits other than the discount rate noted above is the medical cost trend rate the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase for the us postretirement benefit plans is 600 for 2022 declining to 475 by 2026 and remaining at 475 for the years thereafter the effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1 increase in the assumed longterm medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by 11 

▪ the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options and restricted stock units both performancebased and timevested based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant the company uses the blackscholesmerton  “ blackscholes ”  option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards the weightedaverage estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31 2021 was 1111 the blackscholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards expected volatility rate riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumptions do not require significant judgment as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent thirdparty sources changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards a oneyear change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 4 a 1 change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6 the company uses a montecarlo simulation to determine the fair value of performancebased restricted stock units at the date of grant the montecarlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the blackscholes model 

▪ goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets such as the company’s global brands are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired in assessing impairment the company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management when a quantitative analysis is performed the company generally uses the income approach which requires several estimates including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans sales growth rates foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions category growth rates product pricing consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations in selecting an appropriate royalty rate the company considers recent market transactions for similar brands and products in determining an appropriate discount rate the company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital other qualitative factors the company considers in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions industryspecific considerations and historical financial performance the company generally engages a thirdparty valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations 

in determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units fair value is also determined using the market approach which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies as multiple valuation methodologies are used the company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results 

determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share brand history future expansion expectations the level of inmarket support anticipated by management legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold 

the company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its filorga reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility which negatively impacted consumption in the dutyfree travel retail and pharmacy channels the company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinitelived trademark and goodwill and accordingly performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of december 31 2021 the company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded an impairment charge of 204 reducing the carrying value to approximately 588 after adjusting the carrying value of the trademark the company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 367 in the filorga reporting unit reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately 577 

except for the filorga skin health business as described above the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value the fair value of the company’s indefinitelife intangible assets other than filorga exceeds their recorded carrying value by at least 20 therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets 

▪ the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution 

▪ tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards to net realizable value factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction carryforward periods income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

▪ legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances if necessary while it is possible that the company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the company’s financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s contingencies 

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

our oral personal and home care products are sold to a variety of traditional and ecommerce retailers wholesalers and distributors worldwide pet nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers veterinarians and ecommerce retailers our sales to walmart inc and its affiliates represent approximately 12 of our net sales in 2020 no other customer represents more than 10 of our net sales we support our products with advertising promotion and other marketing with increasing emphasis on digital to build awareness and trial of our products our products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers 

the majority of raw and packaging materials used in our products is purchased from other companies and is available from several sources no single raw or packaging material represents and no single supplier provides a significant portion of our total material requirements for certain materials however new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental andor colgate standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time raw and packaging material commodities such as essential oils resins pulp tropical oils tallow corn poultry and soybeans are subject to market price variations for further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices see item 1a “risk factors  volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration the rapid growth of ecommerce the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters products similar to those that we produce and sell are available from multinational and local competitors in the us and overseas certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do in addition the substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models in certain geographies we also face strong local competitors who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products 

the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the increased presence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtocustomer businesses covid19 has accelerated these trends either on a temporary or permanent basis and we have witnessed consumers changing their purchasing patterns including the nature andor frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental veterinary and skin health professionals as well as a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online we face competition in several aspects of our business including pricing promotional activities new product and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels product quality innovation brand recognition marketing capability and acceptance of new products and brands largely determine success in colgate’s operating segments 

we consider trademarks to be of material importance to our business we follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the us and throughout the world where our products are sold principal global and regional trademarks include colgate palmolive elmex hello meridol sorriso tom’s of maine eltamd filorga irish spring lady speed stick pca skin protex sanex softsoap speed stick ajax axion fabuloso murphy soupline and suavitel as well as hill’s science diet and hill’s prescription diet our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used andor registered although we actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole 

covid19 

covid19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live work interact and shop and have significantly impacted and may continue to impact economic activity around the world 

during 2020 many of the communities in which we manufacture market and sell our products experienced unprecedented “stay at home” orders travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 and have implemented varying policies to resume economic activity because the vast majority of our products such as oral care products soaps and other personal hygiene products home cleaners and pet food have been deemed essential for the health and wellbeing of people and their pets we have in most instances been able to continue operating our business in doing so the health safety and wellbeing of our employees has been and remains our first priority in addition some of our suppliers customers distributors and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses 

we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories in 2020 driven by consumer pantryloading and increased consumption of our products in response to covid19 this was particularly true in certain categories such as liquid hand soap dish liquid bar soap and cleaners and we believe that some of the increase in consumption in these categories is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to covid19 as a result we have seen and expect to continue to see heightened competitive activity from our competitors in certain categories including more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges and the marketing of new products in high demand categories at the same time in 2020 we continued to experience declines in certain channels including professional sales and travel retail due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movement in many geographies throughout the world we also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers including the nature andor frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online 

covid19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers’ ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products we expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with covid19 to continue to impact consumer behavior shopping patterns and consumption preferences despite the lifting of government restrictions and the reopening of economies around the world 

for additional information regarding covid19’s impact on our business see part i item 1a “risk factors” and part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview”

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks some of which have occurred andor are occurring and any of which could occur in the future are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of these risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

business and industry risks 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70 of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

• changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows from nonus markets or increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those markets 

• exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product including as a result of covid19 or to repatriate earnings from overseas 

• political or economic instability geopolitical events environmental events widespread health emergencies such as covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics natural disasters or social or labor unrest 

• changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets including as a result of volatile commodity prices including the price of oil 

• lack of wellestablished reliable andor impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual intellectual property or other legal rights 

• foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources and 

• changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of andor the increase in onerous trade restrictions andor tariffs sanctions price controls labor laws travel or immigration restrictions including as a result of covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics profit controls or other government controls 

any or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings 

in addition the impact of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit continues to be unclear brexit continues to pose legal political and economic uncertainty which could subject us to heightened risks in the region including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and disruptions to our workforce and that of our suppliers and business partners we do not however believe brexit has had or will have a material impact on our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

furthermore the imposition of tariffs andor increase in tariffs on various products by the united states and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries and new andor increased tariffs have subjected and may continue in the future to subject us to additional costs and expenditure of resources major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the united states andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which in turn could have a material effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do in addition the substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models 

we face competition in several aspects of our business including pricing promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on or have more effective advertising and promotional activities than we do introduce competing products more quickly andor respond more effectively to business and economic conditions and changing consumer preferences including by launching innovative new products such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our success is increasingly dependent on our ability to effectively leverage digital technology and data analytics to gain new commercial insights and develop relevant marketing and advertising to reach customers and consumers in addition we have experienced and may continue to experience increased demand for many of our products in response to covid19 as a result we have seen and expect to continue to see heightened competitive activity from our competitors in certain of our categories including more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges and the marketing of new products in high demand categories our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property including patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and ecommerce retailers with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation the rapid growth of ecommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers and some of these retailers have and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than we do they have used and may continue to use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances slotting fees or increased investment including through display media paid search preparation fees and coop programs which could lead to reduced sales or profitability the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our customers see “distribution raw materials competition trademarks and patents” in item 1 “business” 

we also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products or environmental sustainability supply chain or packaging initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or that our packaging does not comply with certain environmental supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition “private label” products sold by our retail customers which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our products in addition the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the increased presence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtocustomer businesses the rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures andor adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers if we are not successful in continuing to adapt or effectively react to changes in consumer preferences purchasing patterns and market dynamics andor expanding sales through ecommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products the successful identification development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories channels of distribution or geographies our ability to launch new products to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully 

• identify develop and fund technological innovations 

• obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others 

• obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products including from the fda and other regulatory bodies in the us and abroad and 

• anticipate and quickly respond to the needs and preferences of consumers and customers 

the identification development and introduction of innovative new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable costs and effort and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace 

our ability to quickly innovate and to adapt and market our products to meet evolving consumer preferences and to adapt our packaging to meet evolving customer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy the failure to develop and launch successful new products or to adapt our packaging and supply chain to meet such preferences could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

if in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products 

we face various risks related to pandemics epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we face various risks related to pandemics epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns including the covid19 pandemic a pandemic epidemic or similar widespread health concern could have and covid19 has had and will continue to have a variety of impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition including 

• our ability to continue to maintain and support the health safety and wellbeing of our employees including key employees 

• volatility in the demand for and availability of our products which may be caused by the temporary inability of our consumers to purchase our products due to illness financial hardship quarantine government actions mandating the closure of our distributors or retailers or imposing travel or movement restrictions shifts in demand and consumption away from more discretionary or higher priced products to lowerpriced products or pantryloading activity 

• substantial increases in demand for certain of our products requiring us to increase our production capacity or acquire additional capacity at an additional cost and expense 

• changes in purchasing patterns of our consumers including the frequency of instore visits by consumers to retailers and dental veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift to purchasing our products online from ecommerce retailers 

• disruptions to our global supply chain including the closure of manufacturing and distribution facilities due to among other things the availability of raw and packaging materials or manufacturing components a decrease in our workforce or in the efficiency of such workforce including as a result of illness travel restrictions absenteeism or governmental regulations transportation and logistics challenges including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions or reduced shipping capacity or the impact of covid19 on our retailers third party suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers or distributors 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our retailers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers customers commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties 

• significant changes in the economic and political conditions of the markets in which we operate which could restrict and have restricted our employees’ ability to work and travel could mandate and have mandated or caused the closure of certain distributors or retailers our offices shared business service centers andor operating and manufacturing facilities or otherwise could prevent and have prevented us as well as our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the manufacture distribution sale and support of our products 

• disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets which may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital andor 

• volatility in foreign exchange rates and in raw and packaging materials and logistics costs 

despite our efforts to manage these impacts their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration severity and geographic scope of an outbreak such as covid19 the availability widespread distribution and use of safe and effective vaccines and the actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health and economic effects 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance diversity equity and inclusion sustainability and social impact brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives negative publicity about us our brands our products our supply chain our ingredients our packaging our environmental social and governance practices including as they relate to diversity equity and inclusion or our employees whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation such negative publicity could relate to among other things health concerns threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including deforestation packaging plastic energy and water use and waste management our environmental social and governance practices or other sustainability or policy issues in addition widespread use of digital and social media by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination negative publicity posts or comments on social media about us our brands our products our packaging or our employees whether true or untrue could damage our brands and our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations compliance and environmental social and governance practices thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

our success depends upon our ability to recruit attract and retain key employees including through the implementation of diversity equity and inclusion initiatives and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to recruit attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected successfully executing organizational change including management transitions at leadership levels of the company and succession plans for senior management is critical to our business success while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time further changes in immigration laws and policies including during the covid19 pandemic have made in certain circumstances and may continue to make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical professional and management personnel to meet our business needs in addition we are working to advance culture change through the implementation of diversity equity and inclusion initiatives throughout our organization if we do not or are perceived not to successfully implement these initiatives our ability to recruit attract and retain talent may be adversely impacted 

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures which could adversely impact our business 

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands businesses or technologies from third parties acquisitions and their pursuit involve numerous potential risks including among other things 

• realizing the full extent of the expected benefits or synergies as a result of a transaction within the anticipated time frame or at all 

• successfully integrating the operations technologies services products and systems of the acquired brands or businesses in an effective timely and costefficient manner 

• receiving necessary consents clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction 

• diverting management’s attention from other business priorities 

• successfully operating in new lines of business channels of distribution or markets 

• retaining key employees partners suppliers and customers of the acquired business 

• conforming standards controls procedures and policies of the acquired business with our own 

• developing or launching products with acquired technologies and 

• other unanticipated problems or liabilities 

moreover acquisitions have resulted in and could in the future result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transaction costs any of these risks should they materialize could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we have divested and may in the future periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

operational risks 

our business results are impacted by our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain andor key office facilities 

we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale our operations and those of our suppliers contract manufacturers or logistics providers have been and may continue to be disrupted by a number of factors including but not limited to 

• environmental events 

• widespread health emergencies such as covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics 

• strikes and other labor disputes 

• disruptions in logistics 

• loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites 

• loss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers 

• supplier capacity constraints 

• raw material and product quality or safety issues 

• industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues 

• the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets 

• the lack of availability of qualified personnel such as truck drivers 

• governmental incentives and controls including import and export restrictions such as new or increased tariffs sanctions quotas or trade barriers and 

• natural disasters including climatic events including any potential effect of climate change and earthquakes acts of war or terrorism political unrest or uncertainty fires or explosions cybersecurity incidents and other external factors over which we have no control 

in addition we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from singlesource suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time 

we believe that the supplies of raw and packaging materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate in addition we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers and the supply of raw and packaging materials nonetheless a significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason including those mentioned above could interrupt product supply and if not remedied could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition as a result of our global shared service organizational model certain of our functions such as marketing payroll finance and accounting customer service and logistics and human resources are concentrated in key office facilities a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason including those mentioned above could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as essential oils resins pulp tropical oils tallow corn poultry and soybeans are subject to market price variations increases in the costs of andor a reduction in the availability of commodities energy and logistics and other necessary services including during the covid19 pandemic have affected and may continue to adversely affect our profit margins if commodity and other cost increases continue in the future and we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases we may not be able to sustain the price increases also sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition see “our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain andor key office facilities” above for additional information 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

one way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization which we refer to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials among other things the achievement of our fundingthegrowth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our fundingthegrowth initiatives our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected any failure to implement our fundingthegrowth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our fundingthegrowth initiatives refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview” 

a cybersecurity incident data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems “it systems” including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties including cloudbased service providers and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited to

• handling other processes involved in managing our business 

although we have a broad array of information security measures in place our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups individuals and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion social engineering password theft or introduction of viruses or malware such as ransomware through phishing emails we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers is securely maintained data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur furthermore we periodically upgrade our it systems or adopt new technologies if such an upgrade or new technology does not function as designed does not go as planned or increases our exposure to a cyberattack or cyber incident it may adversely impact our business including our ability to ship products to customers issue invoices and process payments or order raw and packaging materials although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cybersecurity attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date if we suffer a significant loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted or otherwise we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations litigation fines andor damages which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

furthermore while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place if our it systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance of failure of or cyberattack on thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages cybersecurity breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation any of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

climate change and other sustainability matters may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

it has been reported that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters the predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water and other ingredients in addition concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment despite our sustainability efforts any failure to achieve our sustainability goals including those aimed to reduce our impact on improve or preserve the environment or the perception whether or not valid that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation there is also increased focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations investors customers consumers our employees and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters including responsible sourcing and deforestation the use of plastic energy and water the recyclability or recoverability of packaging including singleuse and other plastic packaging and ingredient transparency our reputation could be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

legal and regulatory risks

new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities around the world review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products while we monitor and seek to mitigate the impact of any emerging information a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide antibribery laws including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and laws that prohibit commercial bribery while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees joint venture partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the cost of responding to such a claim including management time and outofpocket expenses and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation brand image and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business

financial and economic risks 

uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions including as a result of covid19 may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business unfavorable global economic conditions such as a recession economic slowdown andor reduced category growth rates including as a result of covid19 could negatively impact our business and result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points during periods of economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions consumers may reduce consumption or discretionary spending andor change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to “private label” or lowerpriced brands these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins furthermore economic conditions can cause our suppliers distributors contract manufacturers logistics providers or other thirdparty partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties which may impact their inability to provide us with or distribute finished product raw and packaging materials andor services in a timely manner or at all in addition we could face difficulty collecting or recovering accounts receivables from third parties facing financial or operational difficulties 

disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets interest rate increases changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace the london interbank offered rate libor or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements such as interest rate foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business 

we are subject to taxes in the us and in the foreign jurisdictions where we do business due to economic and political conditions tax rates in the us and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change changes in the mix of our earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in tax rates changes in tax laws including how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced or contemplated changes in longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could adversely impact our future effective tax rate and business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements “beps” recommended by countries that then made up the g8 and the g20 and the organization for economic cooperation and development in connection with beps companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in countries outside of the us as this and other tax laws and related regulations change our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially impacted for more information regarding us tax reform see note 11 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

furthermore we are subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we have faced and in the future may face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties in excess of reserves the payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below for which the amount of any potential losses can be reasonably estimated the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 425 million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live work interact and shop and have significantly impacted and will likely continue to impact economic activity around the world we have a wellestablished crisis management team “cmt” process and the cmt together with our senior management team and colgate people around the world continue to respond to and manage the challenges presented by covid19 

during the year ended december 31 2020 many of the communities in which we manufacture market and sell our products experienced unprecedented “stay at home” orders travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 and have implemented varying policies to resume economic activity the situation continues to be uncertain and varies by geography as infection rates of covid19 continue to increase in many regions throughout the world and authorities have taken different approaches to address the pandemic and resume economic activity because the vast majority of our products such as oral care products soaps and other personal hygiene products home cleaners and pet food have been deemed essential for the health and wellbeing of people and their pets we have in most instances been able to continue operating our business 

in doing so the health safety and wellbeing of our employees has been and remains our first priority many of our employees globally continue to work from home in those instances where our employees cannot perform their work at home such as in our factories and in certain of our laboratories or in geographies where circumstances have allowed us to offer employees the ability to return to the office often on a voluntary and staggered basis we have implemented additional health and safety measures and social distancing protocols consistent with government recommendations andor requirements to help to ensure their safety often at an additional cost in addition during the year ended december 31 2020 we experienced some limited factory closures and in some cases we have seen increased instances of absenteeism furthermore some of our suppliers customers distributors logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses 

we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories in the year ended december 31 2020 such as liquid hand soap dish liquid bar soap and cleaners driven by consumer pantryloading and increased consumption of our products we believe that some of the increase in consumption in these categories is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to covid19 in other categories such as oral care and pet food consumer demand trends continued to normalize in the second half of the year ended december 31 2020 across our business changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category and geography depending on among other things the severity of the covid19 outbreak and retailer availability at the same time during the year ended december 31 2020 we experienced declines in certain channels including professional sales and travel retail due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movement in many geographies throughout the world we also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers including the nature andor frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online in some instances during the year ended december 31 2020 we were not able to keep up with the increased consumer demand for our products and our products were at times out of stock on retailers’ shelves in some cases we have incurred additional costs as we worked to meet this increased demand despite continuing to significantly ramp up production of indemand products we expect that some of our products may continue to be out of stock on retailers’ shelves for a period of time 

covid19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers’ ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products while we believe that in the longterm consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong uncertainties continue surrounding the timing and extent of the pandemic and the recovery from it these uncertainties include the impact of the timing and scale of changes to travel and movement restrictions in certain geographies the availability and widespread distribution and use of safe and effective covid19 vaccines and when communities will reach herd immunity the timing and impact of consumer pantryloading and destocking activity in certain markets product demand trends and the impact of covid19 on the global economy our retail customers contract manufacturers logistics providers and other third parties are also being impacted by the global pandemic their success in addressing covid19 and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to and sales of our products we expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with covid19 to continue to impact consumer behavior shopping patterns and consumption preferences despite the lifting of government restrictions and the reopening of economies around the world

while we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees and contract providers uncertainty resulting from covid19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business including our global supply chain and retailer network andor require us to incur additional operational costs 

for more information about the anticipated covid19 impact see “outlook” below  

business strategy 

to achieve our business and financial objectives we are focused on innovating our core businesses improving our brand building activities with an elevated brand purpose model and the use of equity advertising innovating to gain market share in high growth segments and adjacencies expanding into new channels and markets maximizing growth online and investing to drive consumption in growing populations we continue to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers dental veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and ecommerce retailers in addition we continue to invest behind our brands not just in terms of advertising but also to build key growth capabilities in areas such as innovation and data and analytics we also continue to broaden our ecommerce offerings including directtoconsumer and subscription services we continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products we are also working to integrate our sustainability and social impact and diversity equity and inclusion strategies across our organization 

we are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers the retail landscape the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation 

the investments needed to drive growth are supported by strong cash flow performance and our disciplined capital allocation strategy these investments are developed through continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through these initiatives which are referred to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials among other things and encompass a wide range of projects examples of which include raw material substitution reduction of packaging materials consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification we also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our oral care personal care and pet nutrition businesses including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health

our restructuring program known as the “global growth and efficiency program” concluded on december 31 2019 initiatives under the global growth and efficiency program fit within the program’s three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities during the year ended december 31 2020 we adjusted the accrual balances related to certain projects approved prior to the conclusion of the global growth and efficiency program to reflect our revised estimate of remaining liabilities which resulted in a reduction of 16 13 aftertax to restructuring accruals no new restructuring projects were approved for implementation during the year ended december 31 2020 during the year ended december 31 2019 we incurred costs of 132 102 aftertax resulting from the global growth and efficiency program for more information regarding the global growth and efficiency program see “restructuring and related implementation charges” below and note 4 restructuring and related implementation charges to the consolidated financial statements 

in december 2019 the swiss government enacted changes to its corporate tax regime which included among other items the repeal of certain preferential tax regimes and an increase to the cantonal tax rate for future periods additionally the government provided transition rules which allowed companies to record goodwill for tax purposes partially offsetting the impact on cash taxes of the higher cantonal rate over the next ten years as a result of these changes we recorded a net benefit of 29 to the provision for income taxes 

in september 2019 we acquired laboratoires filorga cosmétiques sa “filorga” a skin health business for cash consideration of €1548 approximately 1712 in the third quarter of 2020 we completed the purchase of the outstanding noncontrolling interest of filorga’s joint venture based in hong kong and covering the hong kong and china markets for approximately €85 approximately 99 in cash see note 3 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

outlook 

looking forward we expect global macroeconomic political and market conditions to remain challenging especially due to covid19 during the covid19 pandemic we have seen improvement in category growth rates due to heightened demand for certain health and hygiene products particularly liquid hand soap dish liquid bar soap and cleaners we believe some of this increased consumption is sustainable due to consumer behavior changes resulting from covid19 however we expect increased volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates over the next six to twelve months in the longer term we expect category growth rates to remain below historical levels 

while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion we have seen increases in promotional activities in certain markets as retailers try aggressively to get consumers back into the stores after prolonged “stay at home” and other government restrictions ease a trend we expect will continue we have been negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers in key markets such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products or sustainability supply chain or packaging initiatives in addition the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the increased presence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtoconsumer businesses these trends have been magnified due to covid19 in many of our geographies and we plan to continue to invest behind our ecommerce capabilities this rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures andor adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers in certain markets we have incurred and are likely to continue to incur increased logistics costs due to higher ecommerce demand and volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry in addition given that approximately 70 of our net sales originate in markets outside the us we have experienced and will likely continue to experience increasingly volatile foreign currency fluctuations and higher raw and packaging material costs while we have taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions in the current environment it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies should these conditions persist they could adversely affect our future results 

as discussed above we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid19 on our business while we have taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effects of covid19 we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of covid19’s impact on our business results of operations cash flows andor financial condition for more information about factors that could impact our business including due to covid19 see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report 

in summary we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition broad based experience operating in challenging environments resilient global supply chain and focused business strategy our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth through innovation within our core businesses leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories and expanding in high growth channels and markets delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency and maximizing the impact of our environmental social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital including our sustainability and social impact and diversity equity and inclusion strategies our commitment to these priorities the strength of our brands the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through covid19 and increase shareholder value over time

managing foreign currency interest rate commodity price and credit risk exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see “results of operations” above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward and swap contracts option contracts foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the company utilizes forwardstarting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2020 variable rate debt levels a 1 increase in interest rates would have increased interest income expense net by 15 in 2020 

the company is assessing the impact of the discontinuation of libor as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements including debt outstanding and believes it will not be material as the company does not have significant exposure to libor in either its debt or other financing arrangements the company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods 

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as essential oils resins pulp tropical oils tallow corn poultry and soybeans the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the hill ’ s pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

the company’s open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of  3 and 0 at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively at the end of 2020 an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized gain of 1 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company’s policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs 

▪ the company accounts for inventories using both the firstin firstout  “ fifo ”  method 75 of inventories and the lastin firstout  “ lifo ”  method 25 of inventories there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2020 or 2019 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 

▪ shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses the company accounts for such costs primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight as fulfillment costs and reports them in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling general and administrative expenses accordingly the company’s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales if such costs had been included as a component of cost of sales the company’s gross profit margin would have been lower by 845 bps in 2020 and by 810 bps in both 2019 and 2018 with no impact on reported earnings 

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances legal and other contingency reserves 

▪ in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for us defined benefit plans was 265 and 340 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans was 288 and 356 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively discount rates used for the us and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for us plans was 570 as of december 31 2020 and 630 as of 2019 in determining the expected longterm rate of return the company considers the nature of the plans’ investments and the historical rate of return 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 15 9 8 7 and 7 respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 74 in fixed income securities 21 in equity securities and 5 in real estate and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 19 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 3 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected longterm rate of return this rate was 350 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans 

▪ the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits other than the discount rate noted above is the medical cost trend rate the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase for the us postretirement benefit plans is 600 for 2021 declining to 475 by 2026 and remaining at 475 for the years thereafter the effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1 increase in the assumed longterm medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by 10 

▪ the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options and restricted stock units both performancebased and timevested based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant the company uses the blackscholesmerton  “ blackscholes ”  option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards the weightedaverage estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31 2020 was 1126 the blackscholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards expected volatility rate riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumptions do not require significant judgment as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent thirdparty sources changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards a oneyear change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 4 a 1 change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6 the company uses a montecarlo simulation to determine the fair value of performancebased restricted stock units at the date of grant the montecarlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the blackscholes model 

▪ goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets such as the company’s global brands are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired in assessing impairment the company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis 

determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management when a quantitative analysis is performed the company generally uses the income approach which requires several estimates including future cash flows consistent with management’s strategic plans sales growth rates foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions category growth rates product pricing consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations in selecting an appropriate royalty rate the company considers recent market transactions for similar brands and products in determining an appropriate discount rate the company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital other qualitative factors the company considers in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions industryspecific considerations and historical financial performance the company generally engages a thirdparty valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

in determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units fair value is also determined using the market approach which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies as multiple valuation methodologies are used the company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results 

determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share brand history future expansion expectations the level of inmarket support anticipated by management legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 the company assessed whether a “triggering event” had occurred indicating a possible impairment of its goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets as a result of this assessment the company determined that a “triggering event” had occurred relative to its recently acquired filorga skin health business and as required performed a quantitative analysis with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation firm of the value of the filorga reporting unit and its indefinitelife intangible assets based on the analysis the company determined that the fair value of the filorga reporting unit and the related indefinitelife intangible assets continued to exceed their carrying values and were not impaired 

as of the date of the annual goodwill impairment test the fair value of the filorga reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 either a reduction in the longterm growth rate of 50 basis points or an increase in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in the fair value of the filorga reporting unit exceeding its carrying value by less than 5 as of the date of the annual impairment test the fair value of the filorga indefinitelife intangible assets exceeded their carrying value by less than 10 either a reduction in the longterm growth rate of 50 basis points or an increase in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in the fair value of the filorga indefinitelife intangible assets approximating their carrying value given the inherent uncertainties in estimating the future impacts of the covid19 pandemic on global macroeconomic conditions and interest rates in general and on the filorga business in particular actual results may differ from management’s current estimates and could have an adverse impact on one or more of the assumptions used in our quantitative models related to the filorga reporting unit and the related indefinitelife intangible assets resulting in potential impairment charges in subsequent periods given the recent acquisition of filorga where there is inherently a lower surplus of fair value over carrying value management will continue to assess triggering events that may necessitate additional qualitative or quantitative analyses of our reporting units and indefinitelife intangible assets in future periods 

except for the recently acquired filorga business as described above where there is inherently a lower surplus of fair value over carrying value the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value the fair value of the company’s indefinitelife intangible assets other than filorga exceeds their recorded carrying value by at least 20 therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets 

▪ the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution 

▪ tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards to net realizable value factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction carryforward periods income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income 

▪ legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances if necessary while it is possible that the company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the company’s financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s contingencies

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of these risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70 of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 

all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings 

in addition the impact of the united kingdom’s exit from and the related negotiations with the european union commonly referred to as brexit are at this time unclear brexit has created legal political and economic uncertainty which could subject us to heightened risks in the region including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and disruptions to our workforce and that of our suppliers and business partners we do not however believe brexit will have a material impact on our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

furthermore the recent imposition of tariffs andor increase in tariffs on various products by the united states and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries and new andor increased tariffs have subjected and may continue in the future to subject us to additional costs and expenditure of resources major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the united states andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which in turn could have a material effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which may have greater resources than we do in addition the substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models 

we face competition in several aspects of our business including pricing promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on or have more effective advertising and promotional activities than we do introduce competing products more quickly andor respond more effectively to changing consumer preferences and business and economic conditions such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property including patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and ecommerce retailers with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation the rapid growth of ecommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers and some of these retailers have and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than we do they have used and may continue to use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our customers see “distribution raw materials competition trademarks and patents” in item 1 “business” 

we also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or that our packaging does not comply with certain environmental standards or initiatives could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition “private label” products sold by our retail customers which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our products 

in addition the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the emergence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtocustomer businesses the rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures andor adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers if we are not successful in adapting or effectively reacting to changes in consumer preferences and market dynamics andor expanding sales through ecommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients formulation manufacture packaging content labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising sale and environmental impact us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the “fda” the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas in addition our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad 

new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities in europe the us and other countries review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide antibribery laws including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and laws that prohibit commercial bribery while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees joint venture partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the cost of responding to such a claim including management time and outofpocket expenses and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation brand image and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products the successful identification development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories channels of distribution or geographies our ability to launch new products to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully 

 

the identification development and introduction of innovative new products involves considerable costs and effort and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace 

our ability to quickly innovate and to adapt our products to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

if in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives negative publicity about us our brands our products our supply chain our ingredients our packaging or our employees whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation such negative publicity could relate to among other things health concerns threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability or policy issues in addition widespread use of digital and social media by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination negative publicity posts or comments on social media about us our brands our products our packaging or our employees whether true or untrue could damage our brands and our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

one way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization which we refer to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials among other things the achievement of our fundingthegrowth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our fundingthegrowth initiatives our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected any failure to implement our fundingthegrowth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our fundingthegrowth initiatives refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview” 

volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins essential oils pulp tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  are subject to market price variations increases in the costs andor a reduction in the availability of commodities energy and transportation and other necessary services have affected and may continue to adversely affect our profit margins if commodity and other cost increases continue in the future and we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases we may not be able to sustain the price increases also sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition see “disruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business” below for additional information 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected successfully executing organizational change including management transitions at leadership levels of the company and succession plans for senior management is critical to our business success while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time further changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical professional and management personnel to meet our business needs 

legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories we may be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings including disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment pension data privacy and security environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or an ingredient contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall or reformulate some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a recall or reformulation is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image the resolution of or increase in the reserves taken in connection with one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for that period see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings 

disruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business 

we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale our operations and those of our suppliers or contract manufacturers could be disrupted by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 

in addition we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from singlesource suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time 

we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate in addition we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials nonetheless a significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason including those mentioned above could interrupt product supply and if not remedied could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition as a result of our global shared service organizational model certain of our functions such as marketing payroll finance and accounting customer service and logistics and human resources are concentrated in key office facilities a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason including those mentioned above could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

a cybersecurity incident data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems “it systems” including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties including cloudbased service providers and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited to 

 

although we have a broad array of information security measures in place our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups individuals and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion social engineering password theft or introduction of viruses or malware such as ransomware through phishing emails we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers is securely maintained data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cybersecurity attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations litigation fines andor damages which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

furthermore while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place if our it systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance of failure of or cyberattack on thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages cybersecurity breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation any of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

uncertain global economic conditions disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business unfavorable global economic conditions such as a recession economic slowdown andor continued reduced category growth rates have impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may reduce consumption or switch to “private label” or economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets interest rate increases or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements such as interest rate foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures which could adversely impact our business 

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands businesses or technologies from third parties acquisitions and their pursuit involve numerous potential risks including among other things 

 moreover acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transaction costs any of these risks should they materialize could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we also may periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business 

we are subject to taxes in the us and in the foreign jurisdictions where we do business due to economic and political conditions tax rates in the us and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change changes in the mix of our earnings from countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws including how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced or contemplated changes in longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could adversely impact our future effective tax rate and business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements “beps” recommended by the g8 g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development in connection with beps companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in countries outside of the us as this and other tax laws and related regulations change our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially impacted for more information regarding us tax reform see note 11 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

furthermore we are subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties in excess of reserves the payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

climate change may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

it has been reported that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters the predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water in addition concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment despite our sustainability efforts any failure to achieve our sustainability goals to reduce our impact on the environment or the perception whether or not valid that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation there is also increased focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations investors customers consumers and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters including deforestation and the use of plastic energy and water our reputation could be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below for which the amount of any potential losses can be reasonably estimated the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is  0 to approximately  225 million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year

outlook 

looking forward we expect global macroeconomic political and market conditions to remain challenging although we have seen improvement in category growth rates we expect category growth rates to remain below historical levels while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion we have also been negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers in key markets such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space or delisting of our products in addition the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the emergence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtoconsumer businesses this rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures andor adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers in addition given that approximately 70 of our net sales originate in markets outside the us we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and higher raw and packaging material costs while we have taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect our future results in addition although we are taking steps to mitigate the impact of the novel coronavirus on our business we expect it will negatively impact our business and results of operations in the near term because this situation is continuing to develop the full extent of the impact is not yet known and will depend on among other things the duration of quarantines and other travel restrictions both within china and into and out of china and the degree to which the virus spreads beyond currently affected geographies for more information about factors that could impact our business see part i item 1a risk factors 

in summary we believe we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on our key priorities growing sales through engaging with consumers developing worldclass innovation and working with retail partners driving efficiency on every line of the income statement to increase margins generating strong cash flow performance and utilizing that cash effectively to enhance total shareholder return and leading to win by staying true to the company’s culture and focusing on its stakeholders our commitment to these priorities together with the strength of our global brands our broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets and costsaving initiatives such as our fundingthegrowth initiatives should position us well to increase shareholder value over the long term

managing foreign currency interest rate commodity price and credit risk exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward and swap contracts option contracts foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of 6 and a net unrealized gain of 9 at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2019  an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 82

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2019 variable rate debt levels a 1 increase in interest rates would have increased interest income expense net by 9 in 2019  

the company is assessing the impact of the discontinuation of libor as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements including debt outstanding and believes it will not be material as the company does not have significant exposure to libor in either its debt or other financing arrangements the company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods 

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins essential oils pulp tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the hill ’ s pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

at december 31 2019 and 2018  the company’s open commodity derivative contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting were not material at the end of 2019 an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 1 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company’s policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs 

 

 

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances legal and other contingency reserves

in determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units fair value is also determined using the market approach which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies as multiple valuation methodologies are used the company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results 

determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share brand history future expansion expectations the level of inmarket support anticipated by management legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold 

the estimated fair value of the company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 and the filorga acquisition in 2019 which were recorded at fair value except for recently acquired businesses where there is inherently a lower surplus of fair value over carrying value the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets 

the company determined that the fair value of the sanex intangible assets exceeded their carrying value by more than 10 and concluded that such excess was reasonable considering the brand’s relatively recent acquisition based on this the brand’s recent performance and the company’s future plans for the brand the company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to the sanex intangible assets given the recent acquisition of filorga its performance since its acquisition and the company’s future plans for filorga the company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to the filorga intangible assets 

 

 

 

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

the retail landscape in many of the company’s markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the emergence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtocustomer businesses the company faces competition in several aspects of its business including pricing promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels product quality innovation brand recognition marketing capability and acceptance of new products largely determine success in the company’s operating segments

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of these risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200  countries and territories with approximately 70  of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 

all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings 

in addition the united kingdom’s decision to leave the european union “brexit” has created legal and economic uncertainty if no deal is reached between the united kingdom and the european union by march 29 2019 we could experience disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods to and from the united kingdom and increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound though we do not believe brexit will have a material impact on our business result of operations cash flows or financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 4 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which may have greater resources than we do in addition the substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models 

we face competition in several aspects of our business including pricing promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on or have more effective advertising and promotional activities than we do introduce competing products more quickly andor respond more effectively to changing consumer preferences and business and economic conditions such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property including patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and ecommerce retailers with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation the rapid growth of ecommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers and some of these retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our customers see “distribution raw materials competition trademarks and patents” in item 1 “business” 

we also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition “private label” products sold by retail customers which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our products 

in addition the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the emergence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtocustomer businesses the rapid growth in ecommerce and emergence of alternative retail channels may create pricing pressures andor adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers if we are not successful in adapting or effectively reacting to changes in consumer preferences and market dynamics andor expanding sales through ecommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 5 

our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising sale and environmental impact us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the “fda” the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas in addition our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad 

new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities in europe the us and other countries review the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient that was used by us in the manufacture of colgate total toothpaste until the first quarter of 2019 is an example of an ingredient that has undergone and is undergoing reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide both by itself and in the context of its use in specific products or types of products a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide antibribery laws including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and laws that prohibit commercial bribery while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

 6 

the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful launch of innovative new products and line extensions our ability to launch new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully 

 

the identification development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and effort and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

if in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products 

 7 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives negative publicity about us our brands our products our supply chain our ingredients or our employees whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation such negative publicity could relate to among other things health concerns threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability or policy issues in addition widespread use of digital and social media by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination negative publicity posts or comments on social media about us our brands our products or our employees whether true or untrue could damage our brands and our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

one way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization which we refer to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials among other things the achievement of our fundingthegrowth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our fundingthegrowth initiatives our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected any failure to implement our fundingthegrowth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our fundingthegrowth initiatives refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview”

volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  are subject to market price variations increases in the costs andor a reduction in the availability of commodities energy and transportation and other necessary services have affected and may continue to adversely affect our profit margins if commodity and other cost increases continue in the future and we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases we may not be able to sustain the price increases also sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition see “disruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business” below for additional information 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we do not successfully implement our succession plans for senior management including our chief executive officer our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time 

legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories we may be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings including disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment pension data privacy and security environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or an ingredient contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall or reformulate some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a recall or reformulation is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image the resolution of or increase in the reserves taken in connection with one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for that period see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings

disruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business 

we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale our operations and those of our suppliers could be disrupted by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 

in addition we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from singlesource suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time 

while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate and have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials significant disruption of manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason including any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition as a result of our global shared service organizational model certain of our functions such as marketing finance and accounting customer service and logistics and human resources are concentrated in key office facilities a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason including natural disasters acts of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 10 

a cybersecurity incident data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems “it systems” including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties including cloudbased service providers and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited to 

 

although we have a broad array of information security measures in place our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups individuals and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion social engineering password theft or introduction of viruses or malware such as ransomware through phishing emails we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers is securely maintained data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cybersecurity attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations litigation fines andor damages which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

furthermore while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place if our it systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance of failure of or cyberattack on thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages cybersecurity breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation any of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business unfavorable global economic conditions such as a recession economic slowdown andor reduced category growth rates could negatively impact our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may reduce consumption or switch to “private label” or economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets interest rate increases or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global growth and efficiency program 

our restructuring program which we refer to as the “global growth and efficiency program” commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012 and runs through december 31 2019 the global growth and efficiency program’s initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales operating profit and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses while implementation of the global growth and efficiency program remains on track and is in its final year  and most of the initiatives under the program have been successfully implemented or are nearing completion the successful implementation of the remainder of the program may present significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require successful negotiations with third parties as a result we may not be able to realize all of the remaining anticipated benefits from the global growth and efficiency program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the remaining anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable in addition changes in foreign exchange rates or in tax labor or immigration laws may result in our not achieving the remaining anticipated cost savings as measured in us dollars if we are unable to realize the remaining anticipated savings of the global growth and efficiency program our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement the global growth and efficiency program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding the global growth and efficiency program refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – significant items impacting comparability” and “– restructuring and related implementation charges”

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures which could adversely impact our business 

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands businesses or technologies from third parties acquisitions and their pursuit involve numerous potential risks including among other things 

 moreover acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transaction costs any of these risks should they materialize could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we also may periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business

climate change may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

it has been reported that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters the predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water in addition concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment despite our sustainability efforts any failure to achieve our sustainability goals to reduce our impact on the environment or the perception whether or not valid that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation there is also increased focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations investors customers consumers and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters including deforestation and the use of plastic energy and water our reputation could be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200  countries and territories the company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings these include disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment pension data privacy and security environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions management proactively reviews and monitors the company’s exposure to and the impact of environmental matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sites 

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below for which the amount of any potential losses can be reasonably estimated the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is  0  to approximately  225  million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year

outlook 

looking forward the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain challenging while the company has recently seen improvement in category growth rates the company expects category growth rates to remain below prior historical levels while the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than the company does such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion the company has also been negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of its retail trade customers in key markets such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space or delisting of the company’s products in addition the retail landscape in many of the company’s markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the emergence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtoconsumer businesses this rapid growth in ecommerce and emergence of alternative retail channels may create pricing pressures andor adversely affect the company’s relationships with its key retailers in addition given that approximately 70  of the company’s net sales originate in markets outside the us the company has experienced and may continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the company’s future results 

in summary the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company’s key priorities growing sales through engaging with consumers developing worldclass innovation and working with retail partners driving efficiency on every line of the income statement to increase margins generating strong cash flow performance and utilizing that cash effectively to enhance total shareholder return and leading to win by staying true to the company’s culture and focusing on its stakeholders the company’s commitment to these priorities together with the strength of the company’s global brands its broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets and costsaving initiatives such as the company’s fundingthegrowth initiatives and the global growth and efficiency program should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term

certain of the agreements with respect to the company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as crossdefault provisions noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote see note 6  longterm debt and credit facilities to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the company’s longterm debt and credit facilities

managing foreign currency interest rate commodity price and credit risk exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward and swap contracts option contracts foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of 9 and a net unrealized loss of 9 at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2018  an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 69

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2018  variable rate debt levels a 1 increase in interest rates would have increased interest income expense net by 19 in 2018  

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the hill ’ s pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

at december 31 2018  and 2017  the company’s open commodity derivative contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting were not material at the end of 2018 an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 2 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company’s policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations

in february 2016 the fasb issued its final standard on lease accounting asu no 201602 “leases topic 842” which superseded topic 840 “leases” the new accounting standard was effective for the company beginning on january 1 2019 and required the recognition on the balance sheet of rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for all longterm leases including operating leases and enhanced disclosures about the company’s leasing arrangements substantially all of the company’s leases are considered operating leases and as such under accounting standards in effect at december 31 2018 were not recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2018 and 2017 in july 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201810 “codification improvements to topic 842 leases” to clarify the implementation guidance and asu no 201811 “leases topic 842 targeted improvements” this updated guidance provided an optional transition method which allows for the initial application of the new accounting standard at the adoption date and the recognition of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption the company adopted the new standard beginning on january 1 2019 and elected the optional transition method with no restatement of prior period amounts as allowed under the new accounting standard the company elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations lease classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption the company also elected not to separate lease components from nonlease components and to exclude shortterm leases from its consolidated balance sheet the company’s adoption of the new standard is expected to result in the recognition of rightofuse assets of approximately 450  and liabilities of approximately 575  with no material cumulative effect adjustment to its consolidated balance sheet as of the date of adoption adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated statements of income or cash flows 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201601 “financial instruments–overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” the updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure the amendment to the standard was effective for the company beginning on january 1 2018 and did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb and the international accounting standards board issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition the standard issued as asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” by the fasb provides a comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance the revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to its customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also includes enhanced disclosures during 2016 the fasb issued several accounting updates asu no 201608 201610 and 201612 to clarify implementation guidance and correct unintended application of the guidance the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption the company adopted the new standard on january 1 2018 on a “modified retrospective” basis which did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements as required the company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings results for periods beginning on or after january 1 2018 are presented under topic 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the prior accounting guidance under topic 605 “revenue recognition” 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 and inventories 

 

prior to asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which the company adopted on january 1 2018 shipping and handling costs could be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses prior to 2018 the company also reported such costs as a component of selling general and administrative expenses accordingly the company’s gross profit margin was not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales if such costs had been included in cost of sales the company’s gross profit margin would have decreased by 760  bps and 750  bps in 2017  and 2016  respectively with no impact on reported earnings 

 

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances legal and other contingency reserves 

 

average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 5  5  8  6  and 7  respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 60  in fixed income securities 22  in equity securities and 18  in real estate and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 12 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 3 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350  as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans

the estimated fair value of the company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 and the pca skin and elta md acquisitions in 2018 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets 

the company applies the ‘relief from royalty method’ to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition the “sanex intangible assets” under this method the fair value of an intangible asset is calculated as the present value of future royalty savings generated as a result of owning the intangible asset the key assumptions used in determining the company’s estimate of the fair value of the sanex intangible assets include royalty rates discount rates and longterm revenue growth rates estimating longterm revenue growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer tastes and preferences in determining an appropriate discount rate the company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital as a result of the analysis the company determined that the fair value of the sanex intangible assets exceeded their carrying value by more than 10 and concluded that such excess was reasonable considering the brand’s relatively recent acquisition based on this the brand’s recent performance and the company’s future plans for it the company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to the sanex intangible assets given the recent acquisitions of pca skin and elta md the performance of pca skin and elta md since acquisition and the company’s future plans for these brands the company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to either pca skin’s and elta md’s intangible assets

the company’s effective income tax rate in 2017 included a provisional charge of 275  recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 based on its initial analysis of the tcja using information and estimates available as of february 15 2018 the date on which the company filed its annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 the provisional charge was comprised of 451 related to the onetime deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related withholding taxes and 20 related primarily to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate which were offset by 196 of income taxes which had been previously provided for planned repatriations of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result applicable us and foreign taxes have been provided on substantially all of the company’s accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered indefinitely reinvested 

during 2018 the company finalized its assessment of the impact of the tcja and recognized an additional tax expense of 80  reflecting the impact of transition tax guidance issued by the us treasury and the update of certain estimates and calculations based on information available through the end of 2018 any further guidance issued after december 31 2018 may have an impact to the company’s provision for income tax in the period such guidance is effective 

 

 

 

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of these risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 75  of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 

these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 

 4 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which may have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do introduce competing products more quickly andor respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property including patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the “fda” the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad 

new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities in europe the us and other countries review the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used by us in colgate total toothpaste is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide both by itself and in the context of its use in specific products or types of products in the us colgate total toothpaste is subject to the fda’s rigorous new drug application “nda” process for safety and efficacy effective september 2017 the fda restricted the use of 19 active ingredients including triclosan and triclocarban in antibacterial consumer soaps in the us our consumer soaps do not contain triclosan or triclocarbon some states and municipalities in the us have proposed and minnesota has passed legislation banning the sale of certain consumer products containing triclosan the minnesota legislation does not cover colgate total toothpaste in november 2016 the canadian government finalized its review of the potential human and environmental risks of triclosan concluding that triclosan does not enter the environment in quantities or conditions that pose a danger in canada to human life or health and that triclosan is neither bioaccumulative nor persistent but that triclosan could be entering the environment at levels that could potentially cause harm to some aquatic organisms the canadian government is now working with stakeholders to ensure triclosan remains under a level it has determined to be safe and we will participate in this process triclosan is also currently being evaluated under the european union’s regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals which evaluation process is expected to take several years to complete 

a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business 

 5 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers the emergence of new sales channels and the growing presence of ecommerce retailers may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our customers see “distribution raw materials competition trademarks and patents” in item 1 “business” 

we also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines the emergence of new sales channels for our products may affect and the growing presence of ecommerce retailers have affected and may continue to affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful launch of innovative new products and line extensions our ability to launch new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully 

 

the identification development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

if in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global growth and efficiency program 

our restructuring program which we refer to as the “global growth and efficiency program” is ongoing the global growth and efficiency program’s initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales operating profit and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses while implementation of the global growth and efficiency program is well underway and many of the initiatives under the program have been successfully implemented or are nearing completion the successful implementation of the remainder of the program presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require successful negotiations with third parties as a result we may not be able to realize all of the remaining anticipated benefits from the global growth and efficiency program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the remaining anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable in addition changes in foreign exchange rates or in tax labor or immigration laws may result in our not achieving the remaining anticipated cost savings as measured in us dollars if we are unable to realize the remaining anticipated savings of the global growth and efficiency program our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement the global growth and efficiency program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding the global growth and efficiency program refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – significant items impacting comparability” and “– restructuring and related implementation charges”

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

one way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization which we refer to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials among other things the achievement of our fundingthegrowth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our fundingthegrowth initiatives our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected any failure to implement our fundingthegrowth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our fundingthegrowth initiatives refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview” 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives adverse publicity about us our brands our supply chain or our ingredients regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability or policy issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition widespread use of digital and social media by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination negative publicity posts or comments on social media about us our brands or our products whether true or untrue could damage our brands and our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services have affected and may continue to adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution as a result fluctuations in such prices and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see “disruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business” below for additional information

legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories we may be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings including disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment pension privacy environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings 

disruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business 

we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale our operations and those of our suppliers could be disrupted by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 

in addition we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from singlesource suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time 

while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate and have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials significant disruption of manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason including any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition as a result of our clustering of singlecountry subsidiaries into regional commercial hubs and our implementation of a global shared service organizational model certain of our functions such as marketing finance and accounting customer service and logistics and human resources have become more concentrated in key office facilities a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason including natural disasters acts of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

a cybersecurity incident data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology systems “it systems” including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited to 

 

although we have a broad array of information security measures in place our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently are constantly evolving in nature are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion social engineering password theft or introduction of viruses or malware such as ransomware through phishing emails we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers is securely maintained data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cybersecurity attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations litigation fines andor damages which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

furthermore while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place if our it systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance of failure of or cyberattack on thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages cybersecurity breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation any of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may reduce consumption or switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time 

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures which could adversely impact our results 

we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands businesses or technologies from third parties acquisitions and their pursuit involve numerous potential risks including among other things 

 

 11 

moreover acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation including for infringement of intellectual property or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transaction costs any of these risks should they materialize could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we also may periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively impact our results of operations

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below for which the amount of any potential losses can be reasonably estimated the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is  0  to approximately  250  million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year

the company is in the midst of a restructuring program known as the “global growth and efficiency program” which following the most recent expansion and extension approved by the company’s board of directors on october 26 2017 runs through december 31 2019  the program’s initiatives are expected to help the company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales operating profit and earnings per share and to enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses implementation of the global growth and efficiency program remains on track

outlook 

looking forward the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging and category growth rates around the world to continue to be slow while the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than the company does such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion the company has also been negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of its retail trade customers in key markets such as inventory destocking in addition the growth of ecommerce has affected and continues to affect consumer preferences and market dynamics given that approximately 75  of the company’s net sales originate in markets outside the us the company has experienced and may continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company’s key priorities growing sales through engaging with consumers developing worldclass innovation and working with retail partners driving efficiency on every line of the income statement to increase margins generating strong cash flow performance and utilizing that cash effectively to enhance total shareholder returns and leading to win by staying true to the company’s culture and focusing on its stakeholders the company’s commitment to these priorities together with the strength of the company’s global brands its broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets and costsaving initiatives such as the company’s fundingthegrowth initiatives and the global growth and efficiency program should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term

the company has taken a tax position in a foreign jurisdiction since 2002 that has been challenged by the local tax authorities in 2015 the company became aware of several supreme court rulings in the foreign jurisdiction disallowing certain tax deductions which had the effect of reversing prior decisions since the company had taken deductions in prior years similar to those now disallowed by the court the company as required reassessed its tax position and increased its unrecognized tax benefits by  15  

in 2016 the supreme court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the company’s favor for the years 2002 through 2005 also in 2016 the administrative court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the company’s favor for the years 2008 through 2011 by acknowledging the supreme court’s ruling for the years 2002 through 2005 which eliminated the possibility of future appeals as a result the company recorded a tax benefit of 30 including interest the tax benefit of deductions related to this tax position taken for the years 2006 through 2007 and 2012 through 2014 totals approximately 16 at current exchange rates these deductions are currently being challenged by the tax authorities in the foreign jurisdiction either in the lower courts or at the administrative level and if resolved in the company’s favor will result in the company recording additional tax benefits including interest 

the effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the company’s global business initiatives 

reflecting us tax reform the company expects its effective income tax rate in 2018 to be in the range of 26 to 27 both on a gaap basis and excluding charges related to the global growth and efficiency program

longterm liabilities associated with the company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements various economic assumptions the most significant of which are detailed in “critical accounting policies and use of estimates” below and voluntary company contributions based on current information the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified us pension plan in 2018  management’s best estimate of voluntary contributions the company will make to its us postretirement plans for the year ending december 31 2018  is approximately 75  in addition total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31 2018  from the company’s assets are estimated to be approximately 82

managing foreign currency interest rate commodity price and credit risk exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

prior to the deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan operations which was effective december 31 2015 the functional currency for cp venezuela was the us dollar since venezuela was designated as hyperinflationary and venezuelan currency fluctuations were reported in income the local currencydenominated nonmonetary assets of the venezuelan operations including inventories and property plant and equipment were remeasured at their historical exchange rates while local currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at periodend exchange rates remeasurement adjustments for these operations were included in net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company refer to “significant items impacting comparability” above and to note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s venezuelan operations 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward and swap contracts option contracts foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of 9 and a net unrealized gain of 20 at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2017  an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 79

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2017  variable rate debt levels a 1 increase in interest rates would have increased interest income expense net by 7 in 2017  

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the hill ’ s pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances the provisional charge in 2017 related to us tax reform legal and other contingency reserves and prior to the deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan operations the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela 

 

average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 14  8  6  8  and 8  respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53  in fixed income securities 27  in equity securities and 20  in real estate and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 14 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 2 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350  as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans

the estimated fair value of the company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets 

the company applies the ‘relief from royalty method’ to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition the “sanex intangible assets” under this method the fair value of an intangible asset is calculated as the present value of future royalty savings generated as a result of owning the intangible asset the key assumptions used in determining the company’s estimate of the fair value of the sanex intangible assets include royalty rates discount rates and longterm revenue growth rates estimating longterm revenue growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer tastes and preferences in determining an appropriate discount rate the company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital as a result of the analysis the company determined that the fair value of the sanex intangible assets exceeded their carrying value by more than 10 and concluded that such excess was reasonable considering the brand’s relatively recent acquisition based on this the brand’s recent performance and the company’s future plans for it the company does not believe there is a significant risk of impairment related to the sanex intangible assets 

asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the global growth and efficiency program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values 

 

in accordance with asc 740 income taxes and staff accounting bulletin 118 the company recorded a provisional charge of 275  based on its initial analysis of the tcja using available information and estimates the provisional charge is comprised of 451 related to the onetime deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related withholding taxes and 20 related primarily to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate which are offset by 196 of income taxes which had been previously provided for planned repatriations of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result applicable us and foreign taxes have been provided on substantially all of the company’s accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered indefinitely reinvested 

given the significant complexity of the tcja anticipated guidance from the us treasury about implementing the tcja and the potential for additional guidance from the sec or the fasb related to the tcja or additional information becoming available the company’s provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018 other provisions of the tcja that impact future tax years are still being assessed

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of these risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 75  of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 

these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which may have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property including patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the “fda” the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad 

new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide and colgate total toothpaste in the us is subject to the fda’s rigorous new drug application “nda” process for safety and efficacy in september 2016 the fda issued a final rule on ingredients permitted in antibacterial consumer soaps in the us which will restrict the use of 19 active ingredients including triclosan and triclocarban as of september 2017 the fda ruling will impact our antibacterial bar soap sold in puerto rico which contains triclocarban some states and municipalities in the us have proposed and minnesota has passed legislation banning the sale of certain products containing triclosan the minnesota legislation does not cover colgate total toothpaste in november 2016 environment and climate change canada “eccc” the federal environmental authority in canada finalized its review of the potential human and environmental risks of triclosan concluding that triclosan is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in canada to human life or health and that triclosan is not bioaccumulative or persistent under canadian standards but that triclosan could be entering the environment at levels that could potentially cause harm to some aquatic organisms the canadian government will now work with stakeholders to ensure triclosan remains at safe levels for the environment and we will participate in this process triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european union’s regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” which evaluation process is expected to take multiple years to complete 

 5 

a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our customers see “distribution raw materials competition trademarks and patents” in item 1 “business” 

we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels the emergence of new sales channels for our products such as ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful launch of innovative new products and line extensions our ability to launch new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully 

 

the identification development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

if in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we commenced a global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth which was expanded in 2014 and 2015 the “2012 restructuring program” the 2012 restructuring program’s initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses while we are four years into the implementation of the 2012 restructuring program and many of the initiatives under the program have been successfully implemented or are nearing completion the successful implementation of the remainder of the program presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require successful negotiations with third parties as a result we may not be able to realize all of the remaining anticipated benefits from the 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the remaining anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable in addition changes in foreign exchange rates or in tax labor or immigration laws may result in our not achieving the remaining anticipated cost savings as measured in us dollars if we are unable to realize the remaining anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding the 2012 restructuring program refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview and outlook” and “– restructuring and related implementation charges”

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we develop investments needed to support growth through our continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization which we refer to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials among other things the achievement of our fundingthegrowth targets depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our fundingthegrowth initiatives our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected any failure to implement our fundingthegrowth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our fundingthegrowth initiatives refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview and outlook” 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives adverse publicity about us our brands our supply chain or our ingredients regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability or policy issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media website whether true or untrue could harm our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution 

 8 

legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business 

from time to time we may be subject to legal claims and proceedings including disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment privacy environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings 

disruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business 

we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale our operations and those of our suppliers could be disrupted by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 

in addition we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from singlesource suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time 

while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate and have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials significant disruption of manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition as a result of our clustering of singlecountry subsidiaries into regional commercial hubs and our implementation of a global shared service organizational model certain of our functions such as marketing finance and accounting and customer service and logistics have become more concentrated in key office facilities a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason including natural disasters acts of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 9 

a cybersecurity incident data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology systems “it systems” including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited to 

 

although we have a broad array of information security measures in place our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by the company or its thirdparty service providers is securely maintained data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cybersecurity attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations civil litigation fines andor damages which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

furthermore while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place if our it systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance of failure of or cyberattack on thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages cybersecurity breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and litigation which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 10 

uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may reduce consumption or switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time 

we may pursue acquisitions and divestitures which could adversely impact our results 

we may pursue acquisitions of brands businesses or technologies from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of acquired brands or businesses the development or launch of products with acquired technologies the estimation of and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of management’s attention from other business priorities which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition we may be unable to achieve any anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or at all 

moreover our pursuit of acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation including for infringement of intellectual property or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transaction costs all of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we also may periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively impact our results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200  countries and territories the company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings these include disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment privacy environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions management proactively reviews and monitors the company’s exposure to and the impact of environmental matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sites 

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is  0  to approximately  225  million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of these risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 75  of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 4 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which may have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the “fda” the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad 

new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide and colgate total toothpaste is subject to the fda’s rigorous new drug application “nda” process for safety and efficacy triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european union’s regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach which requires the registration of all covered chemicals used in the european union by 2018 the fda is also evaluating the use of benzalkoniam chloride an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products and triclosan in hand soaps and hand sanitizers some states and municipalities in the us have proposed and minnesota has passed legislation banning the sale of certain products containing triclosan the minnesota legislation does not cover colgate total toothpaste environment canada the federal environmental authority in canada is also conducting a review to assess human and environmental risks of triclosan and is expected to issue its final assessment in 2016 a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 5 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our customers see “distribution raw materials competition trademarks and patents” in item 1 “business” 

we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels the emergence of new sales channels for our products such as ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful launch of innovative new products and line extensions our ability to launch new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully 

 

the identification development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 6 

if in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth which was expanded in 2014 and 2015 the “2012 restructuring program” the 2012 restructuring program’s initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses the successful implementation of the remainder of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require successful negotiations with third parties as a result we may not be able to realize all of the remaining anticipated benefits from the 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the remaining anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may result in our not achieving the remaining anticipated cost savings as measured in us dollars if we are unable to realize the remaining anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding the 2012 restructuring program refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview and outlook” and “– restructuring and related implementation charges” 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we develop investments needed to support growth through our continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization which we refer to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials among other things the achievement of our fundingthegrowth targets depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our fundingthegrowth initiatives our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected any failure to implement our fundingthegrowth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our fundingthegrowth initiatives refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview and outlook” 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives adverse publicity about us our brands or our ingredients regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media website whether true or untrue could harm our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers 

additionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 

 7 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution 

legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business 

from time to time we may be subject to legal claims and proceedings including disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings 

disruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business 

we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale our operations and those of our suppliers could be disrupted by a number of factors including but not limited to 

  8 

in addition we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from singlesource suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time 

while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate and have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials significant disruption of manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition as a result of our clustering of singlecountry subsidiaries into regional commercial hubs and our implementation of a global shared service organizational model certain of our functions such as marketing finance and accounting and customer service and logistics have become more concentrated in key office facilities a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason including natural disasters acts of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

a cybersecurity incident data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology systems “it systems” including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited to 

 although we have network security measures in place our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by the company or its thirdparty service providers is securely maintained data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cybersecurity attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations civil litigation fines andor damages which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 9 

furthermore while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place if our it systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance of failure of or cyberattack on thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages cybersecurity breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and litigation which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit recent and proposed changes in the bank regulatory environment could reduce the ability of financial institutions to extend credit or increase the cost we are charged to receive credit reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time 

we may pursue acquisitions and divestitures which could adversely impact our results 

we may pursue acquisitions of brands businesses or technologies from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of acquired brands or businesses the development or launch of products with acquired technologies the estimation of and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of management’s attention from other business priorities which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition we may be unable to achieve any anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or at all 

moreover our pursuit of acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation including for infringement of intellectual property or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transaction costs all of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we also may periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively impact our results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200  countries and territories the company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings these include disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions management proactively reviews and monitors the company’s exposure to and the impact of environmental matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sites 

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is  0  to approximately  175  million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year

as discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” with approximately 75  of its net sales generated outside the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations in 2010 and 2013 and effective devaluations in 2014 and 2015 high inflation and a precipitous decline in the price of oil and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources increasingly the company’s venezuelan subsidiary “cp venezuela” has experienced various production interruptions due to material shortages caused by limited access to us dollars for imported materials delays in the importation process due to regulations and controls imposed by the venezuelan government labor unrest and high costs due to inflation coupled with the inability to increase prices without government approval price controls which became effective in april 2012 affect the majority of products in cp venezuela’s portfolio and restrict the company’s ability to implement price increases without government approval which has limited the company’s ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations in addition during the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government issued the law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 for products and services 

cp venezuela’s business is reliant on imported materials and products and it cannot maintain regular operations without sufficient access to us dollars which is controlled by the government in february 2015 the venezuelan government implemented changes in venezuela’s foreign exchange regime while the official exchange rate as determined by the national center for foreign commerce “cencoex” remained at 630  bolivares per dollar and the sicad i supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency currency market now known as sicad was unchanged the sicad ii market was eliminated and a new alternative currency market the foreign exchange marginal system “simadi” was created and became operational with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants cp venezuela has funded its requirements for imported goods through a combination of us dollars obtained from cencoex and intercompany borrowings although access to us dollars in venezuela has been challenging because the majority of the products in cp venezuela’s portfolio have been designated as “essential” by the venezuelan government historically cp venezuela’s access to us dollars at the official rate of 630  bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its us dollar obligations for imported goods however cp venezuela’s access to us dollars to fund imports became increasingly more limited and sporadic in 2015 and deteriorated even further during the fourth quarter of 2015 although the simadi market has been accessible to cp venezuela it did not participate in that market through december 31 2015 since its inception the volume of transactions in the simadi market as a whole has been very limited and the simadi exchange rate at december 31 2015 was 19870  bolivares per dollar since the majority of cp venezuela’s product portfolio is subject to price controls it could not operate profitably without substantial price increases approved by the government if it had to pay for imported materials with us dollars obtained from the simadi market 

the company’s business in venezuela and the company’s ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions the restrictive exchange control regulations in venezuela and cp venezuela’s increasingly limited access to us dollars have resulted in an ‘otherthantemporary’ lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and the us dollar this lack of exchangeability together with other government controls on pricing payments profits and imports and restrictive labor laws have significantly impacted the company’s ability to make key operational decisions over its business in venezuela including the ability to manage its capital structure material sourcing product pricing and labor relations the company expects these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future as a result effective december 31 2015 the company concluded it no longer meets the accounting criteria for consolidation of cp venezuela and began accounting for cp venezuela using the cost method of accounting as a result the company recorded an aftertax charge of 1058   1084  pretax or 116  per diluted share in 2015 the charge primarily consists of an impairment of the company’s investment in cp venezuela of 952  which includes intercompany receivables from cp venezuela and 111  related to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses

effective december 31 2015 cp venezuela’s net assets which include 75 and 394 of cash and government bonds respectively are no longer included in the company’s consolidated balance sheet cp venezuela’s net sales operating profit and net income through december 31 2015 are included in the company’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2015 for the year ended december 31 2015 cp venezuela represented approximately 4  of the company’s consolidated net sales and approximately 2 of the company’s consolidated operating profit excluding the impacts of charges related to the change in accounting for the company’s venezuelan operations the 2015 venezuela remeasurements as defined below a foreign competition law matter and the 2012 restructuring program and a gain on the sale of the company’s laundry detergent business in the south pacific 

in future periods under the cost method of accounting the company will no longer include the results of cp venezuela in its consolidated financial statements and will include income relating to its venezuelan operations only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to cp venezuela or for dividends or royalties remitted by cp venezuela although cp venezuela’s local operating results will no longer be included in the company’s consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes under current tax rules the company is required to continue including cp venezuela in its consolidated us federal income tax return colgate has been operating in venezuela for 72 years and the company expects its operations in venezuela to continue to provide venezuelan consumers with the company’s market leading brands 

prior to the change in accounting for the company’s venezuelan operations which was effective december 31 2015 the company remeasured the financial statements of cp venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expected to remit future dividends which based on the advice of legal counsel was the sicad rate during the year ended december 31 2015 the company incurred pretax losses of 34   22  aftertax or 002  per diluted common share related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated net monetary assets at the quarterend sicad rate the quarterend sicad rate was 1200  bolivares per dollar 1280  bolivares per dollar 1350  bolivares per dollar and 1350  bolivares per dollar as of the end of the first second third and fourth quarters of 2015 respectively the remeasurement losses incurred in the second and third quarters of 2015 are referred to as the “2015 venezuela remeasurements” 

during the year ended december 31 2014 the company incurred net pretax losses of 327   214  aftertax or 023  per diluted common share related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated net monetary assets at the quarterend sicad i rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014 the “2014 venezuela remeasurements” the sicad i rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and remained at 1200  bolivares per dollar as of december 31 2014 

during the year ended december 31 2013 the company incurred a pretax loss of 172   111  aftertax or 012  per diluted common share related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated net monetary assets at the date of the devaluation that changed the official exchange rate from 430  to 630  bolivares per dollar the “2013 venezuela remeasurement” the 2015 venezuela remeasurements 2014 venezuela remeasurements and 2013 venezuela remeasurement are referred to together as the “venezuela remeasurements” 

included in the remeasurement losses during 2015 and 2014 were charges related to the devaluationprotected bonds issued by the venezuelan government and held by cp venezuela because the official exchange rate remained at 630  bolivares per dollar the devaluationprotected bonds did not revalue at the sicad rate but remained at the official exchange rate which resulted in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds

in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth the program’s initiatives are expected to help the company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses

the board authorized the expansion of the 2012 restructuring program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas 

cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 restructuring program once all phases are approved and implemented are estimated to be 1285  to 1435   950  to 1050  aftertax exclusive of the expansion approved in october 2015 discussed below savings from the 2012 restructuring program substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows are projected to be approximately 405  to 475  pretax  340  to 390  aftertax annually by the end of the fourth year of the program exclusive of the expansion approved in october 2015 

in 2015  2014  and 2013  the company incurred aftertax costs of 183  208  and 278  respectively associated with the 2012 restructuring program 

 on october 29 2015  recognizing the macroeconomic challenges around the world and the company’s successful implementation of the 2012 restructuring program to date the company’s board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the company’s laundry detergent business in the south pacific discussed below to expand the 2012 restructuring program and extend it for one  year through december 31 2017 initiatives under the expanded 2012 restructuring program will continue to fit within the program’s three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities the company expects the initiatives under the expanded program to have a similar aftertax rate of return to the existing program which on average has been 30 the company will update its disclosure to reflect the impact the expansion will have on the range of estimated charges and savings for the 2012 restructuring program when the additional initiatives under the expanded program are approved 

for more information regarding the 2012 restructuring program see “restructuring and related implementation charges” below 

in august 2015 the company completed the sale of its laundry detergent business in the south pacific to henkel ag  co kgaa for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 310  australian dollars  221  and recorded a pretax gain of  187   120  aftertax or  013  per diluted share in other income expense net the gain is net of charges related to the rightsizing of the company’s south pacific business asset writeoffs related to the divested laundry detergent business and other costs related to the sale as discussed above the funds from the sale will be reinvested to expand the 2012 restructuring program

on september 13 2011 the company’s mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the united states of america the “purchaser” the mexico city site on which its commercial operations technology center and soap production facility were located the parties have subsequently amended the agreement to extend the closing date under the existing agreement the final installment of the purchase price is due upon the transfer of the property which is subject to the company’s satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by february 29 2016 if these conditions are not fully satisfied by such date the agreement will automatically be extended to march 30 2016 while these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by march 30 2016 in which case the purchaser has several options under the agreement including termination and the return to it of the first two installments of the purchase price based on the discussions to date the company believes that an additional amendment will be negotiated and the transfer of the property is expected to occur by the third quarter of 2016 the company has reinvested the first two installments to relocate its soap production to a new stateoftheart facility at its mission hills mexico site to relocate its commercial and technology operations within mexico city and to prepare the existing site for transfer exit costs incurred during the project primarily relate to staff leaving indemnities accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site buildingready in 2015  2014  and 2013 the company incurred aftertax costs of 0  3  and 12  respectively related to the sale of land in mexico 

looking forward the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging while the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than the company does such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion additionally the company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs driven by foreign exchange transaction costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company’s strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands innovation for growth effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win this focus together with the strength of the company’s global brands its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives such as the 2012 restructuring program should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term

as of december 31 2015  the company had approximately  4600  of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no us income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and therefore are not subject to such taxes should these earnings be repatriated in the future they would be subject to applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes as the company operates in over 200  countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated 

the following represents the scheduled maturities of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  



 

 

longterm liabilities associated with the company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements various economic assumptions the most significant of which are detailed in “critical accounting policies and use of estimates” below and voluntary company contributions based on current information the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified us pension plan in 2016  management also does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the us pension plans for the year ending december 31 2016  in addition total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31 2016  from the company’s assets are estimated to be approximately 63

managing foreign currency interest rate commodity price and credit risk exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

prior to the change in accounting for the company’s venezuelan operations which was effective december 31 2015 the functional currency for cp venezuela was the us dollar since venezuela was designated as hyperinflationary and venezuelan currency fluctuations were reported in income the local currencydenominated nonmonetary assets of the venezuelan operations including inventories and property plant and equipment were remeasured at their historical exchange rates while local currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at periodend exchange rates remeasurement adjustments for these operations were included in net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company refer to executive overview and outlook above and to note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s venezuelan operations 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward and swap contracts local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 35 and 22 at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2015  an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 39

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2015  variable rate debt levels a 1 increase in interest rates would have increased interest income expense net by 14 in 2015  

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the hill ’ s pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

the company’s open commodity derivative contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized losses of 0 and 1 at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively at the end of 2015  an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 2 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company’s policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories

the estimated fair value of the company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 80  of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 

 4 

for example the company’s ability to manage its venezuelan operations has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by difficult conditions in venezuela including the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 and the effective devaluations that occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multitier foreign exchange system in 2014 since april 2012 when price controls affecting most of our venezuelan subsidiary’s “cp venezuela” product portfolio became effective we have not been able to implement price increases without government approval which has limited our ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations in addition labor laws limit our ability to manage overhead costs and at times production at cp venezuela has been negatively impacted by local labor issues going forward additional government actions including in the form of further currency devaluations or effective devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls foreign exchange price or profit controls or expropriation or other form of government takeover could have further adverse impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as could economic instability resulting from the decline in the price of oil for additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlook” and note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from local competitors and other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the “fda” the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad 

new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste and certain other oral care products is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european union’s regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach which requires the registration of all covered chemicals used in the european union by 2018 in the us the fda is evaluating the use of benzalkoniam chloride an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products and triclosan in hand soaps and hand sanitizers in 2014 a law banning the sale of certain products containing triclosan was passed in minnesota but the law does not cover colgate total toothpaste similar legislation has been proposed in iowa new york and michigan while legislation seeking to ban the sale of all consumer products containing triclosan has been proposed in chicago illinois environment canada the federal environmental authority in canada is also conducting a review to assess human and environmental risks of triclosan and is expected to issue its final assessment in march 2015 depending on the findings in the final assessment it is possible that environment canada will issue voluntary or mandatory risk management measures for triclosan a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business 

 5 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit recent and proposed changes in the bank regulatory environment could reduce the ability of financial institutions to extend credit or increase the cost we are charged to receive credit reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability 

we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels the emergence of new sales channels such as sales via ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions the identification development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully 

 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

if in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth which was expanded in the fourth quarter of 2014 to take advantage of additional savings opportunities as expanded the “2012 restructuring program” the 2012 restructuring program’s initiatives are expected to help us ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses the successful implementation of the remainder of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases requires successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers and other business partners as a result we may not be able to continue to realize the anticipated benefits from the 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding the 2012 restructuring program refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview and outlook” and “– restructuring and related implementation charges”

volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain key materials including the triclosan used in colgate total toothpaste we use singlesource suppliers in addition for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints climatic events such as droughts or hurricanes and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials and an interruption in their supply could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

similarly adverse publicity about us our brands or our ingredients regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media web site could harm our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

our business is subject to product liability false advertising and consumer fraud claims 

from time to time we may be subject to product liability claims alleging among other things that our products cause damage to property or persons provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants in addition from time to time we may be subject to claims from competitors and consumers including consumer class actions alleging that our product claims are deceptive or that our ingredient or content labeling is defective regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend for example as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” we have been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products we sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos causing harm to consumers in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a product liability false advertising or consumer fraud claim is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we develop investments needed to support growth through our continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization which we refer to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses and distribution and logistics the achievement of our fundingthegrowth targets depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our fundingthegrowth initiatives our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement our fundingthegrowth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our fundingthegrowth initiatives refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview and outlook” 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities 

we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 while we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

a breach of information security a cybersecurity incident or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputation 

we rely extensively on information technology systems including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited to 

  9 

 although we have network security measures in place our information technology systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our information technology systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations civil litigation fines andor damages which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition furthermore while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance failure or cyberattack of thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages cybersecurity breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and litigation which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time 

we may acquire or divest brands or businesses which could adversely impact our results 

we may pursue acquisitions of brands or businesses from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired brands or businesses estimation of and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of management’s attention from other business priorities which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

moreover acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transaction costs all of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we also may periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively impact our results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories the company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings these include disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions management proactively reviews and monitors the company’s exposure to and the impact of environmental matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sites 

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is  0  to approximately  200  million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year

as discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” with approximately 80  of its net sales generated outside the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations high inflation and the decline in the price of oil and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources price controls which became effective in april 2012 affect most products in the portfolio of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary “cp venezuela” and restrict the company’s ability to implement price increases without government approval which has limited the company’s ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations in particular the company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 and the effective devaluations that have occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multitier foreign exchange system implemented during the first quarter of 2014 in addition the decline in the price of oil may result in a reduced availability of us dollars to fund cp venezuela’s imports 

during the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government enacted several changes to venezuela’s foreign exchange regime introducing a multitier foreign exchange system creating three exchange rate mechanisms available to convert venezuelan bolivares to us dollars although the official exchange rate as determined by the national center for foreign commerce “cencoex” remained at 630  bolivares per dollar the exchange rate for foreign investments moved to the rate available on the sicad i supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency currency market the venezuelan government also introduced an alternative currency market known as sicad ii the company remeasures the financial statements of cp venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends which based on the advice of legal counsel is the sicad i rate 

during the year ended december 31 2014 the company incurred net pretax losses of 327   214  aftertax losses or 023  per diluted common share related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated net monetary assets at the quarterend sicad i rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014 the sicad i rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and remained at 1200  bolivares per dollar as of december 31 2014  included in the net remeasurement losses during 2014 were charges related to the devaluationprotected bonds issued by the venezuelan government and held by cp venezuela because the official exchange rate remained at 630  bolivares per dollar the devaluationprotected bonds did not revalue at the rate available on the sicad i currency market but remained at the official exchange rate which resulted in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds the net remeasurement losses incurred in 2014 are referred to as the “2014 venezuela remeasurements” 

there continue to be ongoing impacts primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements and to a lesser degree the import of materials at the sicad i exchange rate as some imports may still qualify for the official rate because the sicad i market is auctionbased and auctions are held periodically during each quarter the exchange rate available through sicad i may vary throughout the year which would cause additional remeasurements of cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated net monetary assets and further impact cp venezuela’s ongoing results 

cp venezuela continues to be able to settle certain of its us dollar obligations for imported materials at the official rate of 630  bolivares per dollar and records the gains related to such transactions when the funds are authorized by cencoex and the liabilities are paid 

as part of the announcements during the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government also issued a new law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 the new law does not apply to products that are subject to price controls which includes most of the products in cp venezuela’s portfolio during the third quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government approved price increases for the majority of cp venezuela’s product portfolio which were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014

during the year ended december 31 2013 the company incurred a pretax loss of 172   111  aftertax loss or 012  per diluted common share related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated net monetary assets at the date of the devaluation that changed the official exchange rate from 430  to 630  bolivares per dollar the “2013 venezuela remeasurement” the 2014 venezuela remeasurements and the 2013 venezuela remeasurement are referred to together as the “venezuela remeasurements” 

cp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods through a combination of us dollars obtained from cencoex and intercompany borrowings cp venezuela’s supply of us dollars to fund imports has been limited and sporadic cp venezuela was invited to participate in the sicad i currency market during the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and received less than 1 in each of those quarters at a rate of 1050 bolivares per dollar and 1200 bolivares per dollar respectively although accessible to the company the company did not participate in the sicad ii currency market during 2014 cp venezuela’s difficulty in accessing us dollars to support its operations has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the business additionally at times production at cp venezuela has also been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country 

for the year ended december 31 2014  cp venezuela represented approximately 3  of the company’s consolidated net sales and approximately 1 of the company’s consolidated operating profit excluding the impacts of the 2014 venezuela remeasurements charges related to the 2012 restructuring program and certain european competition law matters and the sale of land in mexico discussed below at december 31 2014  cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated net monetary asset position which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of further changes in the sicad i rate was 549  this amount includes the devaluationprotected bonds issued by the venezuelan government cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated nonmonetary assets were 310  at december 31 2014  and included 235  of fixed assets that could be subject to impairment if cp venezuela is not able to implement further price increases to offset the impacts of continued high inflation or further devaluations or if it does not have sufficient access to us dollars to fund imports 

in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced changes in venezuela’s foreign exchange regime while the official exchange rate as determined by cencoex remains at 630 bolivares per dollar and the sicad i market now known as sicad is unchanged and the rate currently remains at 1200 bolivares per dollar the sicad ii market discussed above has been eliminated and a new alternative currency market the foreign exchange marginal system “simadi” has been created with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants the simadi market became operational with an initial exchange rate of 17004 bolivares per dollar while the company will continue to assess the impact if any of these changes as the government of venezuela issues regulations to implement them if cp venezuela is unable to obtain sufficient us dollars from cencoex or the sicad market to fund its requirements for imported goods and instead needs to access the simadi market it could significantly impact the company’s operations in venezuela 

 the company continues to actively manage its investment in and limit its exposure to venezuela the company’s business in venezuela and the company’s ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by the difficult conditions described above additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange pricing payments profits or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest would further negatively affect the company’s business in venezuela and the company’s ability to effectively make key operational decisions in regard to its venezuelan operations both of which could result in an impairment of the company’s investment in cp venezuela at december 31 2014  the company’s total investment in cp venezuela was 955 which included intercompany payables of cp venezuela 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth the program’s initiatives are expected to help the company ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses

on october 23 2014 the company’s board of directors approved an expansion of the global growth and efficiency program as expanded the “2012 restructuring program” the initiatives under the 2012 restructuring program continue to be focused on the following areas 

 

the board authorized the expansion of the 2012 restructuring program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas 

cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 restructuring program once all phases are approved and implemented are estimated to be 1285 to 1435 950 to 1050 aftertax implementation of the 2012 restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by december 31 2016 savings substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows are projected to be approximately 405 to 475 pretax 340 to 390 aftertax annually by the fourth year of the program in 2014  2013  and 2012  the company incurred aftertax costs of 208  278  and 70  respectively associated with the 2012 restructuring program for more information regarding the 2012 restructuring program see “restructuring and related implementation charges” below 

on september 13 2011 the company’s mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the united states of america the “purchaser” the mexico city site on which its commercial operations technology center and soap production facility were located the sale price is payable in three installments with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property which is subject to the company’s satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by march 20 2015 while these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by march 20 2015 in which case the purchaser has several options under the agreement including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments based on the transaction to date the company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015 the company has reinvested the first two installments to relocate its soap production to a new stateoftheart facility at its mission hills mexico site to relocate its commercial and technology operations within mexico city and to prepare the existing site for transfer exit costs incurred during the project primarily relate to staff leaving indemnities accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site buildingready 

in 2014  2013  and 2012 the company incurred aftertax costs of 3  12  and 18  respectively related to the sale of land in mexico and in 2012 the company incurred aftertax costs of 14 associated with various business realignment and other costsaving initiatives 

looking forward the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging while the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from local competitors and other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than the company does such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion additionally the company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs driven by foreign exchange transaction costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company’s strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands innovation for growth effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win this focus together with the strength of the company’s global brand names its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives such as the 2012 restructuring program should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term

as of december 31 2014  the company had approximately  4900  of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no us income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and therefore are not subject to such taxes should these earnings be repatriated in the future they would be subject to applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes as the company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated

longterm liabilities associated with the company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements various economic assumptions the most significant of which are detailed in “critical accounting policies and use of estimates” below and voluntary company contributions based on current information the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified us pension plan in 2015 management also does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the us pension plans for the year ending december 31 2015 in addition total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31 2015 from the company’s assets is estimated to be approximately 69  

additionally liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities see note 11  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information

managing foreign currency interest rate commodity price and credit risk exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries other than those operating in highly inflationary environments are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments currently venezuela local currencydenominated nonmonetary assets including inventories goodwill and property plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates while local currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at yearend exchange rates remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward and swap contracts local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 22 and 5 at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2014  an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 29 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2014  variable rate debt levels a 1 increase in interest rates would have increased interest income expense net by 10 in 2014  

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans  the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the hill ’ s pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

the company’s open commodity derivative contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 1 and 0 at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively at the end of 2014  an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 2 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company’s policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations 

recent accounting pronouncements 

on may 28 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” and the international accounting standards board “iasb” issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition the standard issued as accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” by the fasb provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance the revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards this new guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1 2017 with no early adoption permitted the standard allows for either “full retrospective” adoption meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or “modified retrospective” adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements while the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

 on april 10 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201408 “reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity” asu no 201408 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements the new guidance is effective for the company on a prospective basis beginning january 1 2015 this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories 

 

 

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves

average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 11  10  7  5  and 8  respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans’ investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53  in fixed income securities 27  in equity securities and 20  in real estate and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 11 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 4 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350  as of december 31 2014  december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans 

 

 

 

the estimated fair value of the company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values asset impairment analysis related to the fixed assets of the company’s subsidiary in venezuela requires management’s best estimate of future exchange rates between the us dollar and the venezuelan bolivares the rate of inflation in venezuela the timing and amount of future selling price increases for products sold in venezuela whether the company has sufficient access to us dollars to fund imports

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 80  of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 

for example we have been and will continue to be impacted by developments in venezuela including the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 and the announcements made in late january 2014 on april 1 2012 price controls became effective in venezuela affecting most products in our venezuelan subsidiary’s “cp venezuela” portfolio thereby further restricting our ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluation in addition at 

 4 

times production at cp venezuela has been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country going forward additional government actions including in the form of further currency devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls foreign exchange price or profit controls or expropriation or other form of government takeover could have further adverse impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as could additional labor unrest in venezuela for additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlook” and note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from local competitors and other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the “fda” the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste as well as certain other oral care products and soaps is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european union’s regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals which requires the registration of all chemicals used in the european union by 2018 in the us the fda is evaluating the use of triclosan and benzalkoniam chloride an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products in hand soaps and hand sanitizers in addition potential legislation seeking to ban the sale of consumer products containing triclosan has been proposed by legislators in chicago illinois and in minnesota a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business 

 5 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 

uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability 

we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly restricted could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels the emergence of new sales channels such as sales via ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

the growth of our business depends on the successful development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions the development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully 

  6 

 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program the “2012 restructuring program” for sustained growth the 2012 restructuring program’s initiatives are expected to help us ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses 

the successful implementation of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers and other business partners as a result we may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits from our 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils poultry corn soybeans and tallow are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain key materials including triclosan we use singlesource suppliers in addition for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints climatic events such as droughts or hurricanes and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials and an interruption in their supply could adversely affect our business results of operation cash flows and financial condition 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

similarly adverse publicity about us or our brands regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media web site could harm our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these 

 7 

reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

our business is subject to product liability and false marketing c l aims 

from time to time we may be subject to product liability claims alleging among other things that our products cause damage to property or persons provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants in addition from time to time we may be subject to claims from competitors and consumers including consumer class actions alleging that our product claims are deceptive regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend for example as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” we have been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products we sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos causing harm to consumers in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a product liability or false marketing claim is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities 

we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 while we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our ability to conduct business 

we rely extensively on information technology systems including some which rely on thirdparty service providers in order to conduct our business these systems include but are not limited to 

  8 

 although we have network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users while we have business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance or failure of thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages security breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition furthermore if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our information technology systems or failure of thirdparty service providers we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories the company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings these include disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions management proactively reviews and monitors the company’s exposure to and the impact of environmental matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sites 

as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by the internal revenue service  “ irs ”  and other tax authorities around the world in countries where it conducts business in this regard all us federal income tax returns through december 31 2009 have been audited by and settled with the irs limited matters with respect to years 2002 through 2007 had been in administrative appeals and were settled during 2013 with no adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition with a few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us state and local income tax examinations for the years prior to 2009 in addition the company has subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitations for tax audits generally ranging from three to six years 

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is  0  to approximately  250  million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year

the oral personal and home care segment is operated through five reportable operating segments north america latin america europesouth pacific asia and africaeurasia all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors the company through hill’s pet nutrition also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians 

on an ongoing basis management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance these indicators include market share net sales including volume pricing and foreign exchange components organic sales growth net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestments gross profit margin operating profit net income and earnings per share as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital capital expenditures cash flow and return on capital the monitoring of these indicators and the company’s code of conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

as disclosed in part i item 1a “risk factors” with approximately 80  of its net sales generated outside the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources 

in particular the company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 described in note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements effective february 9 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency and the official exchange rate changed from 430 to 630 venezuelan bolivares fuerte per dollar the company incurred a onetime pretax loss of 172 111 aftertax loss in the first quarter of 2013 related to the remeasurement of the net monetary assets in the local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation the company remeasures the financial statements of its venezuelan subsidiary  “ cp venezuela ”  at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends at december 31 2013 that rate was 630 as the local currency operations in venezuela translated into fewer us dollars the february 2013 devaluation had and will continue to have an ongoing adverse effect on the company ’ s reported results 

in addition the venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls and price controls price controls which became effective on april 1 2012 affect most products in cp venezuela’s portfolio and thereby further restrict the company’s ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations 

cp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods primarily through a combination of us dollars obtained from cadivi   and intercompany borrowings the amount of us dollars received from cadivi in 2013 was higher than the amount received in 2012 however cp venezuela ’ s supply of us dollars to fund imports has been limited and sporadic in the second quarter of 2013 the venezuelan government introduced a new currency market known as sicad supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency which is an auction market in which only companies invited by the venezuelan government can participate the sicad currency market is expected to be accessible to the company however the company was not able to participate in the auctions held through december 31 2013 cp venezuelas difficulty in accessing us dollars to support its operations has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the business additionally at times production at cp venezuela has also been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country 

at december 31 2013 cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated net monetary asset position which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of a further devaluation was approximately 600  this amount does not include  233  of devaluationprotected bonds issued by the venezuelan government as these bonds provide protection against devaluations by adjusting the amount of bolivares fuerte received at maturity for any devaluation subsequent to issuance cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated nonmonetary assets were approximately 335  at december 31 2013 and included approximately 225 of fixed assets that could be subject to impairment if cp venezuela continues to be unable to implement price increases to offset the impacts of continued high inflation or further devaluations or if it does not have sufficient access to us dollars to fund imports for the year ended december 31 2013 cp venezuela represented approximately 4  of the company’s consolidated net sales and approximately 3 of the company’s consolidated operating profit excluding the impact of the onetime venezuela devaluation charge and charges related to the 2012 restructuring program discussed below the competition law matter in france related to the home care and personal care sectors and costs related to the sale of land in mexico discussed below 

in late january 2014 the venezuelan government made several announcements affecting currency exchange and other controls although the official exchange rate remains at 630 bolivares fuerte per dollar the government announced that the exchange rate for foreign investments will move to the rate available on the sicad currency market which in the last auction was 1170 bolivares fuerte per dollar while there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature of transactions that will flow through sicad and how sicad will operate in the future effective with the quarter ending march 31 2014 the company expects that the majority of cp venezuela’s net monetary assets will be remeasured at the sicad rate since that is the rate the company now believes based on the advice of legal counsel will be applicable for future dividend remittances in addition because the official exchange rate remains at 630 bolivares fuerte per dollar the company currently expects that the 233 million of devaluationprotected bonds issued by the venezuelan government and held by cp venezuela will not revalue at the rate available on the sicad currency market but will remain at the official rate if the sicad rate were to remain at 1170 

 16 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

during the quarter ending march 31 2014 the company estimates it would incur a onetime aftertax loss of approximately 180200 or 019021 per diluted common share 

because the sicad market is auctionbased and auctions are held periodically during each quarter the exchange rate available through sicad may vary throughout the year which would cause additional remeasurements of cp venezuela’s local currencydenominated net monetary assets and further impact cp venezuela’s ongoing results 

although as described above there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the implementation of the sicad rate the company anticipates that there also will be ongoing impacts primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements and to a lesser degree the import of materials at the new exchange rate while it is still unclear the company believes that some of its imports may still qualify for the official rate of 630 bolivares fuerte per dollar based on this assumption and the sicad rate at the most recent 1170 bolivares fuertes per dollar the company preliminarily estimates that the ongoing impacts during 2014 would be in the range of 011014 per diluted common share

looking forward the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging while the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from local competitors and other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than the company does such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion additionally the company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company’s strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands innovation for growth effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win this focus together with the strength of the company’s global brand names its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives such as the 2012 restructuring program should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the longterm

liquidity and capital resources 

the company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs including for debt service dividends capital expenditures costs related to the 2012 restructuring program and stock repurchases the company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets

investing activities used 890  of cash in 2013  compared to 865  and 1213  during 2012  and 2011  respectively purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2013  to 505  from 545  in 2012  primarily due to a decrease in purchases of investments by the company ’ s subsidiary in venezuela of local currency denominated fixed interest rate bonds issued by the venezuelan government partially offset by an increase of the company ’ s investments through other foreign subsidiaries in 2012 the company acquired the remaining interest in tom ’ s of maine for 18 in 2011 the company ’ s mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the mexico city site on which its commercial operations technology center and soap production facility are located during 2011 and 2012 the company received the first and second installments of 24 and 36 respectively related to the sale of land in mexico the final installment of 60 is due upon transfer of the property which is expected to occur in 2014 in 2011 the company also acquired the sanex business for 966  the company sold its noncore laundry detergent business in colombia in 2011 for 215 135 aftertax gain capital expenditures were 670  565  and 537  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns capital expenditures for 2014 are expected to remain at an annual rate of approximately 45 of net sales which is higher than the historical rate of approximately 35 primarily due to the 2012 restructuring program

the following is a summary of the company’s commercial paper and global shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2013  and 2012  



certain of the facilities with respect to the company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as crossdefault provisions noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote see note 6 longterm debt and credit facilities to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the company’s longterm debt and credit facilities 

on march 7 2013 the board approved a twoforone stock split of the company ’ s common stock to be effected through a 100 stock dividend the “2013 stock split” the record date for the twoforone stock split was the close of business on april 23 2013 and the share distribution occurred on may 15 2013 the board authorized that the number of shares remaining under the 2011 program defined below as of may 15 2013 be increased by 100 as a result of the twoforone stock split all per share amounts and numbers of shares outstanding in the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements are presented on a postsplit basis refer to note 8 capital stock and stockbased compensation plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

as of december 31 2013  the company had approximately  4700  of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no us income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and therefore are not subject to such taxes should these earnings be repatriated in the future they would be subject to applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable 

the following represents the scheduled maturities of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  



 

 

longterm liabilities associated with the company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements various economic assumptions the most significant of which are detailed in “critical accounting policies and use of estimates” below and voluntary company contributions based on current information the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified us pension plan in 2014 management does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the us pension plans for the year ending december 31 2014 in addition total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31 2014 from the company’s assets is estimated to be approximately 98  

additionally liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities see note 11 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information

managing foreign currency interest rate commodity price and credit risk exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries other than those operating in highly inflationary environments are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments currently venezuela inventories prepaid expenses goodwill and property plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at yearend exchange rates remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward option and swap contracts local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 5 and 1 at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2013  an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 33 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates

based on yearend 2013  variable rate debt levels a 1 increase in interest rates would have increased interest income expense net by 5 in 2013  

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins pulp essential oils tallow tropical oils poultry corn and soybeans  the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the hill ’ s pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

the company’s open commodity derivative contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 0 and 1 at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively at the end of 2013  an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 1 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company’s policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311 “presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists” the new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2013 and interim periods within those years this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories

average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 9  11  7  6  and 8  respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53  in fixed income securities 27  in equity securities and 20  in real estate and other investments as the funded status of the plans improved in 2013 the company reallocated a portion of the assets of the us plans from equity securities to fixed income securities and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 11 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 3 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350  as of december 31 2013  350  as of december 31 2012  and 400 as of december 31 2011  refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans

the estimated fair value of the company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded book value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values asset impairment analysis related to the fixed assets of the company’s subsidiary in venezuela requires management’s best estimate of future exchange rates between the us dollar and the bolivar fuerte the rate of inflation in venezuela and the timing and amount of future selling price increases for products sold in venezuela 

 

 

 

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 80  of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 4 

these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements the company engages in a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 

for example in february 2013 the government of venezuela devalued its currency which will adversely affect our business and results of operations for 2013 likewise in 2010 our results of operations were adversely impacted by the designation of venezuela as hyperinflationary and the subsequent currency devaluations in venezuela in that year in addition on april 1 2012 price controls became effective in venezuela affecting most products in our venezuelan subsidiarys cp venezuela portfolio thereby further restricting the companys ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation in the fourth quarter of 2012 production at cp venezuela was negatively impacted by labor issues within the country going forward additional government actions including in the form of further currency devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls foreign exchange or price controls or continued or increased labor unrest in venezuela could have further adverse impacts on our business and results of operations for additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlook” and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins for example continuing economic uncertainty in europe and a worsening of the debt crisis there could negatively affect consumer confidence globally 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities any disruption in the credit markets including in europe could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition worldwide including from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities and new product introductions such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability 

we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels in addition the emergence of new sales channels such as sales via ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results 

the growth of our business depends on the successful development and launch of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions the development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully 

 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in the company not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program the 2012 restructuring program for sustained growth the 2012 restructuring programs initiatives are expected to help the company ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses 

the successful implementation of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers and other business partners as a result we may not be able to realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits from our 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our profitability 

volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins tropical oils essential oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives 

in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business 

similarly adverse publicity about the company or our brands regarding health concerns our environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about the company on any social media web site could harm our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

our business is subject to product liability claims 

from time to time the company may be subject to product liability claims alleging among other things that its products cause damage to property or persons provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants for example the company has been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products it sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos causing harm to consumers in addition if one of the company’s products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a product liability claim is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image 

our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad us federal authorities including the fda the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency epa regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local level and comparable authorities overseas 

because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used primarily in colgate total toothpaste as well as certain other oral care products and soaps is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide a finding by a regulatory authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could have a material adverse impact on our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise have a material adverse effect on our business 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities 

the company is engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems including some which rely on thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to 

 although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance or failure of thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages security breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business and reputational harm which may adversely impact the company’s business 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our future operations could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business may be materially adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories the company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings these include disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters management proactively reviews and monitors the company’s exposure to and the impact of environmental matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sites 

as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities around the world in countries where it conducts business in this regard all us federal income tax returns through december 31 2007 have been audited by the irs and there are limited matters in administrative appeals for years 2002 through 2007 the settlement of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition with a few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us state and local income tax examinations for the years prior to 2007 in addition the company has subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitations for tax audits generally ranging from three to six years incremental tax payments related to potential disallowances for subsequent periods are not expected to be material 

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is  0  to approximately  225  million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

brazilian matters 

in 2001 the central bank of brazil sought to impose a substantial fine on the company’s brazilian subsidiary based on alleged foreign exchange violations in connection with the financing of the company’s 1995 acquisition of the kolynos oral care business from wyeth formerly american home products the seller as described in the company’s form 8k dated january 10 1995 the company appealed the imposition of the fine to the brazilian monetary system appeals council the council and on january 30 2007 the council decided the appeal in the company’s favor dismissing the fine entirely however certain tax and civil proceedings that began as a result of this central bank matter are still outstanding as described below 

the brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the company’s brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition the tax assessments with interest at the current exchange rate approximate  130  million the company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authority’s appellate process with the following results to date 

  

   

the company has filed a motion for clarification with a special appeals chamber of the taxpayers’ council and further appeals are available within the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel and other advisors that the disallowances are without merit and that the company should ultimately prevail on appeal if necessary in the brazilian federal courts 

  

in 2002 the brazilian federal public attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of brazil laboratorios wyethwhitehall ltda the brazilian subsidiary of the seller and the company as represented by its brazilian subsidiary seeking to annul an april 2000 decision by the brazilian board of tax appeals that found in favor of the seller’s brazilian subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of kolynos the action seeks to make the company’s brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the seller’s brazilian subsidiary although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that the company should ultimately prevail in this action the company intends to challenge this action vigorously

executive overview and outlook 

colgatepalmolive company seeks to deliver strong consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable 

to this end the company is tightly focused on two product segments oral personal and home care and pet nutrition within these segments the company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories these product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable longterm growth 

operationally the company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region the company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the company’s sales and profitability approximately 80  of the company’s net sales are generated from markets outside the us with approximately 50  of the company’s net sales coming from emerging markets which consist of latin america greater asiaafrica excluding japan and central europe this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world 

the oral personal and home care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments north america latin america europesouth pacific and greater asiaafrica all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors the company through hill’s pet nutrition also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market selling its products principally through specialty pet retailers and the veterinary profession 

on an ongoing basis management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance these indicators include market share net sales including volume pricing and foreign exchange components organic sales growth net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestments gross profit margin operating profit net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company and earnings per common share as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital capital expenditures cash flow and return on capital the monitoring of these indicators and the company’s code of conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls 

to achieve its business and financial objectives the company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth the company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis to enhance these efforts the company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the company’s products 

the investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through these initiatives which are referred to as the company’s fundingthegrowth initiatives the company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses and distribution and logistics and encompass a wide range of projects examples of which include raw material substitution reduction of packaging materials consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification the company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses specifically oral care personal care and pet nutrition 

as disclosed in part i item 1a “risk factors” with approximately 80  of its net sales generated outside of the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political and economic uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price controls labor disruptions and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

in particular the company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 described in note 14 “venezuela” to the consolidated financial statements on february 8 2013 the venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency and effective on february 9 2013 the official exchange rate changed from 430 to 630 per dollar this devaluation had no impact on the companys 2012 consolidated financial statements the companys preliminary assessment of the onetime impact of the devaluation is that the company will incur an aftertax loss of approximately 120 025 per common share in the first quarter of 2013 related to the remeasurement of the local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation there will also be ongoing impacts primarily related to the remeasurement of the local financial statements at the new exchange rate we will remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela for 2013 at 630 the rate at which we now expect to remit dividends while it is difficult to project it is the companys preliminary estimate that these ongoing impacts will reduce diluted earnings per common share by 005 to 007 per share per quarter in 2013 taking into account both the companys ability to take actions in venezuela and elsewhere to mitigate the effect of the devaluation and ongoing price control regulations in venezuela 

in addition the venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls and price controls while cp venezuela continues to have limited access to us dollars from the government cadivi and currently only for imported goods the timing of receipt of these funds has slowed and become increasingly unpredictable cp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods primarily through a combination of us dollars obtained from cadivi intercompany borrowings and the use of financial and other intermediaries and to a lesser extent with existing us dollar cash balances which were obtained previously through parallel market transactions and through the prior liquidation of its us dollardenominated bond portfolio on april 1 2012 additional price controls became effective affecting most products in cp venezuela’s portfolio thereby further restricting the company’s ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation in the fourth quarter of 2012 production at cp venezuela was negatively impacted by labor issues within the country 

the company’s business in venezuela and the company’s ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange pricing or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest following the february 2013 devaluation cp venezuelas local currencydenominated net monetary asset position which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of a further devaluation was reduced to approximately 390 as compared to approximately 520 at december 31 2012 and it is expected that cp venezuela will represent less than 4 of the companys consolidated net sales in 2013 the company continues to actively manage its investment in and exposure to venezuela 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program the 2012 restructuring program for sustained growth the program’s initiatives are expected to help colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses implementation of the 2012 restructuring program which is expected to be substantially completed by december 31 2016 is projected to result in cumulative pretax charges once all phases are approved and implemented totaling between 1100 and 1250 775 and 875 aftertax savings are projected to be in the range of 365 to 435 pretax 275 to 325 aftertax annually by the fourth year of the program substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows for more information regarding the 2012 restructuring program see “restructuring and related implementation charges” below 

in 2012 the company incurred aftertax costs of 14  associated with the business realignment and other costsaving initiatives and aftertax costs of 18  related to the sale of land in mexico discussed below 

on september 13 2011 the company’s mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the united states of america the mexico city site on which its commercial operations technology center and soap production facility are located the sale price is payable in three installments with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property which is expected to occur in 2014 the company is reinvesting these payments to relocate its soap production to a new stateoftheart facility to be constructed at its mission hills mexico site to relocate its commercial and technology operations within mexico city and to prepare the existing site for transfer as a result the company expects to make capital improvements and incur costs to exit the site through 2014 these exit costs will primarily be related to staff leaving indemnities accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site buildingready

on july 29 2011 in connection with the sanex acquisition discussed below colgate sold its noncore laundry detergent business in colombia to unilever for 215  resulting in a pretax gain of 207   135  aftertax in 2011 this gain was more than offset by pretax costs of 224   177  aftertax associated with the implementation of business realignment and other costsaving initiatives the sale of land in mexico and a competition law matter in france related to a divested detergent business as discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements the business realignment and other costsaving initiatives include the integration of sanex the rightsizing of the colombia business and the closing of an oral care facility in mississauga canada and a hill’s facility in los angeles california 

on june 20 2011 the company colgatepalmolive europe sàrl unilever nv and unilever plc together with unilever nv “unilever” finalized the company’s acquisition from unilever of the sanex personal care business in accordance with a business and share sale and purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of €676   966  the acquisition was financed with available cash proceeds from the sale of the company’s eurodenominated investment portfolio and the issuance of commercial paper 

looking forward we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion additionally we continue to experience foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company’s strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands innovation for growth effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win this focus together with the strength of the company’s global brand names its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives such as the 2012 restructuring program should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the longterm

net cash provided by operations in 2012  was 3196  as compared with 2896  in 2011  and 3211  in 2010  net cash provided by operations for 2012  increased due to higher operating earnings lower voluntary benefit plan contributions as compared to 2011  and a continued focus on working capital particularly accounts receivable and inventory management this increase was partially offset by higher income tax payments and payment of the previously disclosed competition law matter in france related to a divested detergent business the decrease in 2011  as compared to 2010  was due primarily to an increase in voluntary benefit plan contributions

certain of the facilities with respect to the company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as crossdefault provisions noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the company’s longterm debt and credit facilities

the following represents the scheduled maturities of the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2012  



 

 

longterm liabilities associated with the company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements various economic assumptions the most significant of which are detailed in “critical accounting policies and use of estimates” below and voluntary company contributions based on current information the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified us pension plan in 2013 management’s best estimate of voluntary contributions to the us pension plans for the year ending december 31 2013 is approximately 100  in addition total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31 2013 from the companys assets is estimated to be approximately 94

managing foreign currency interest rate commodity price and credit risk exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries other than those operating in highly inflationary environments are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments currently venezuela inventories prepaid expenses goodwill and property plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at yearend exchange rates remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward option and swap contracts local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 1 at december 31 2012 and 2011 changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2012 an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 40 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2012 variable rate debt levels a 1percentagepoint increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense net by 12 in 2012 

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins tropical oils essential oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

the company’s open commodity derivative contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 1 and net unrealized losses of 1 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively at the end of 2012 an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 2

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company’s policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu no 201302 requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements for those amounts required to be reclassified into net income in their entirety in the same reporting period for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period crossreference to other disclosures is required as permitted under asu 201302 the company has elected to present reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income within a single note to the financial statements beginning the in first quarter of 2013 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201105 “presentation of comprehensive income” asu no 201105 eliminates the current option to disclose other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity as permitted under asu no 201105 the company has elected to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements beginning in the first quarter of 2012 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories 

 

 

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits stock options asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies

estimated payouts of the us plans for the company’s international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investmentgrade corporate bonds rated aa the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for us plans was 730  as of december 31 2012 775  as of december 31 2011 and 800 as of december 31 2010 in determining the longterm rate of return the company considers the nature of the plans’ investments the expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return 

average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 13  4  8  6  and 8  respectively in addition the current rate of return assumption for the us plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 40  in fixed income securities 52 in equity securities and 8  in real estate and alternative investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 2 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 7 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350  as of december 31 2012 and 400  as of december 31 2011 and 2010 refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans 

 

 

 

the estimated fair value of the company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value except for the intangible assets acquired in the recent sanex acquisition which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded book value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 80  of our net sales coming from markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements the company engages in a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 

for example in 2010 our results of operations were adversely impacted by the designation of venezuela as hyperinflationary and the subsequent currency devaluations in venezuela also in november 2011 a new price control law came into effect in venezuela while it is not yet clear how the new law will be implemented it could adversely affect the companys current pricing strategies in venezuela going forward additional currency devaluations or continued or worsening foreign exchange or price controls in venezuela could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations for additional information regarding the risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview and outlook” and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flow although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins for example continuing economic uncertainty in europe and a worsening of the debt crisis there could negatively affect consumer confidence globally 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities any disruption in the credit markets including in europe could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition around the world including from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities and new product introductions such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitors 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges both in terms of management time and outofpocket expenses may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability also tighter credit or capital markets could negatively affect our retail customers and as a result affect our working capital we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels 

the growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully 

 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in the company not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins tropical oils essential oils tallow corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry government and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives 

in addition from time to time third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business 

similarly adverse publicity regarding our responses to health concerns our environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

our business is subject to product liability claims 

from time to time the company may be subject to product liability claims alleging among other things that its products cause damage to property or persons provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants for example the company has been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products it sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos causing harm to consumers in addition if one of the companys products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a product liability claim is successful or a recall required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image 

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive regulation in the us and abroad such regulation applies to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad us federal authorities including the food and drug administration fda the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency epa regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local level and comparable authorities overseas 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our european competition matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition new or more stringent regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used primarily in colgate total toothpaste as well as certain other oral care products and soaps is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities around the world a finding by a regulatory authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could have a material adverse impact on our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to timely obtain regulatory approval of new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients could likewise have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities 

the company is engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems including some which rely on thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses 

security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including the poor performance or failure of thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages security breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in the ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our future operations could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business may be materially adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time

all of the facilities we operate are well maintained and adequate for the purpose for which they are intended 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories the company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings these include disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters management proactively reviews and monitors the company’s exposure to and the impact of environmental matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sites 

as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities around the world in countries where it conducts business in this regard all us federal income tax returns through december 31 2007 have been audited by the irs and there are limited matters in administrative appeals for years 2002 through 2007 the settlement of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition with a few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us state and local income tax examinations for the years prior to 2007 in addition the company has subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitations for tax audits generally ranging from three to six years estimated incremental tax payments related to potential disallowances for subsequent periods are not expected to be material 

the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 

the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is  0  to approximately  200  million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

based on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the company’s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year 

brazilian matters 

in 2001 the central bank of brazil sought to impose a substantial fine on the company’s brazilian subsidiary based on alleged foreign exchange violations in connection with the financing of the company’s 1995 acquisition of the kolynos oral care business from wyeth formerly american home products the seller as described in the company’s form 8k dated january 10 1995 the company appealed the imposition of the fine to the brazilian monetary system appeals council the council and on january 30 2007 the council decided the appeal in the company’s favor dismissing the fine entirely however certain tax and civil proceedings that began as a result of this central bank matter are still outstanding as described below 

the brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the company’s brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition the tax assessments with interest at the current exchange rate approximate  113  million the company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authority’s appellate process with the following results to date 

  

   

the company has filed a motion for clarification with a special appeals chamber of the taxpayers’ council and further appeals are available within the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel and other advisors that the disallowances are without merit and that the company should ultimately prevail on appeal if necessary in the brazilian federal courts 

  

in 2002 the brazilian federal public attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of brazil laboratorios wyethwhitehall ltda the brazilian subsidiary of the seller and the company as represented by its brazilian subsidiary seeking to annul an april 2000 decision by the brazilian board of tax appeals that found in favor of the seller’s brazilian subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of kolynos the action seeks to make the company’s brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the seller’s brazilian subsidiary although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that the company should ultimately prevail in this action the company intends to challenge this action vigorously 

  

in december 2005 the brazilian internal revenue authority issued to the company’s brazilian subsidiary a tax assessment with interest and penalties of approximately  67  million at the current exchange rate based on a claim that certain purchases of us treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions the company is disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authority’s administrative appeals process in october 2007 the second board of taxpayers which has jurisdiction over these matters ruled in favor of the internal revenue authority in january 2008 the company appealed this decision and in january 2012 a special appeals chamber of the taxpayers’ council denied the companys appeal although there can be no assurances management believes based on the advice of its brazilian legal counsel that the tax assessment is without merit and that the company should prevail on appeal if not at the administrative level in the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge this assessment vigorously 

european competition matters

executive overview and outlook 

colgatepalmolive company seeks to deliver strong consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable 

to this end the company is tightly focused on two product segments oral personal and home care and pet nutrition within these segments the company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories these product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable longterm growth 

operationally the company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region the company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the company’s sales and profitability approximately 80  of our net sales are generated from markets outside the us with approximately 50  of our net sales coming from emerging markets which consist of latin america greater asiaafrica excluding japan and central europe this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world 

the oral personal and home care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments north america latin america europesouth pacific and greater asiaafrica all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors the company through hill’s pet nutrition also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market selling its products principally through specialty pet retailers and the veterinary profession 

on an ongoing basis management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance these indicators include market share sales including volume pricing and foreign exchange components organic sales growth net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestments gross profit margin operating profit net income and earnings per share as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital capital expenditures cash flow and return on capital the monitoring of these indicators and the company’s corporate governance practices including the company’s code of conduct help to maintain business health and strong internal controls 

to achieve its business and financial objectives the company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth the company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis to enhance these efforts the company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the company’s products 

the investments needed to support this growth are developed through continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses which are referred to as the company’s fundingthegrowth initiatives the company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses specifically oral care personal care and pet nutrition 

on june 20 2011 the company colgatepalmolive europe sàrl unilever nv and unilever plc together with unilever nv “unilever” finalized the company’s acquisition from unilever of the sanex personal care business in accordance with a business and share sale and purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of €676   966  subject to certain postclosing purchase price adjustments the acquisition was financed with available cash proceeds from the sale of the company’s eurodenominated investment portfolio and the issuance of commercial paper 

on july 29 2011 in connection with the sanex acquisition colgate sold its laundry detergent business in colombia to unilever for 215  resulting in a pretax gain of 207   135  aftertax gain this gain was more than offset by pretax costs of 224    177  aftertax costs associated with the implementation of various business realignment and other costsaving initiatives the sale of land in mexico and a competition law matter in france related to a divested detergent business as discussed further below 

the various business realignment and other costsaving initiatives include the integration of sanex the rightsizing of the colombia business and the closing of an oral care facility in mississauga canada and a hill’s facility in los angeles ca

on september 13 2011 the company’s mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the united states of america the mexico city site on which its commercial operations technology center and soap production facility are located the sale price is payable in three installments with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property which is expected to occur in 2014 the company intends to reinvest these payments to relocate its soap production to a new stateoftheart facility to be constructed at its mission hills mexico site to relocate its commercial and technology operations within mexico city and to prepare the existing site for transfer as a result over the next three years the company expects to make capital improvements and incur costs to exit the site these exit costs will primarily be related to staff leaving indemnities accelerated depreciation and demolition 

as disclosed in item 1a “risk factors” with over 80  of its net sales generated outside of the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange controls price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources 

in particular as a result of the devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte described more fully in note 13 “venezuela” to the consolidated financial statements the local currency operations of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary cp venezuela now translate into fewer us dollars the company has taken and continues to take actions to mitigate the impact of both devaluations on its operations although its ability to do so in the future may be limited due to new price controls instituted by the venezuelan government as a result the company may be unable to implement its pricing strategy to offset the effects of inflation in venezuela 

additionally the venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls and currency exchange and payment controls during 2010 a new currency market was established and the government closed the freefloating parallel market under existing regulations cp venezuela is not permitted to access the new currency market but continues to have limited access to us dollars at the official rate and currently only for imported goods as a result cp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods through a combination of us dollars obtained from the government at the official rate intercompany borrowings and existing us dollar cash balances which were obtained previously through parallel market transactions and through the prior liquidation of its us dollardenominated bond portfolio 

the company’s business in venezuela and the companys ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange pricing or imports or other governmental actions for the year ended december 31 2011  cp venezuela represented approximately 5  of the company’s consolidated net sales at december 31 2011  cp venezuela’s local currency monetary net asset position was approximately  311  

looking forward we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending additionally we continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company’s recently updated strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands innovation for growth effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win this focus together with the strength of the company’s global brand names and its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term

financing activities used 1242  of cash during 2011 compared to 2624  and 2270  during 2010 and 2009 this difference was primarily due to higher net proceeds from the issuance of debt and a lower level of share repurchases the increase in 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and dividends paid partially offset by higher net proceeds from issuances of debt

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

longterm liabilities associated with the company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements various economic assumptions the most significant of which are detailed in “critical accounting policies and use of estimates” below and voluntary company contributions based on current information the company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified us pension plan until 2013 management’s best estimate of voluntary contributions to the us pension plans for the year ending december 31 2012 is approximately 100  in addition total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31 2012 from the companys assets is estimated to be approximately 87 

additionally liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information

managing foreign currency interest rate and commodity price exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

  

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries other than those operating in highly inflationary environments are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments currently venezuela inventories prepaid expenses goodwill and property plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at yearend exchange rates remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward option and swap contracts local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 1 at december 31 2011 and net unrealized losses of 3 at december 31 2010 changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2011 an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 42 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2011 variable rate debt levels a 1percentagepoint increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense net by 18 in 2011 

  

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins tropical oils essential oils tallow corn and soybeans the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

the company’s open commodity derivative contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized losses of 1 and net unrealized gains of 4 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively at the end of 2011 an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have increased the net unrealized loss to 3 

  

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company’s policy to contract with highly rated diverse counterparties 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201105 “presentation of comprehensive income” asu no 201105 eliminates the current option to disclose other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity as permitted under asu no 201105 the company has elected to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements beginning in the first quarter of 2012 this standard will not have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories

percent of sales would have decreased by 750 bps from 573 to 498 in 2011 and decreased by 730 bps in 2010 and 2009 with no impact on reported earnings 

 

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits stock options asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies 

 

average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 3  3  6  7  and 8  respectively in addition the current rate of return assumption for the us plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 40 in fixed income securities 52 in equity securities and 8 in real estate and alternative investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 9 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 5 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 40 as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

risk factors 

tableend 

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 75 of our net sales coming from markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company ’ s exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition we manage our foreign currency exposure to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging we cannot provide assurances however that these measures will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 

for example in 2010 our results of operations were adversely impacted by the designation of venezuela as hyperinflationary and the subsequent currency devaluations in venezuela going forward another currency devaluation or continued exchange control limitations in venezuela could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for additional information regarding the risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview and outlook” and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flow although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition around the world including from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities and new product introductions such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitors 

  

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges both in terms of management time and outofpocket expenses may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soap and shower gel 

the growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of innovative new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully 

 

 

 

 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in the company not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins tallow essential oils tropical oils corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry government and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

  

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives 

adverse publicity about product safety or quality or allegations of product contamination or tampering whether or not valid may result in a product recall or reduced demand for our products a significant product recall could tarnish the image of the affected brands and cause consumers to choose other products 

in addition from time to time third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are often inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business 

similarly adverse publicity regarding our responses to health concerns our environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

our business is subject to extensive regulation in the us and abroad such regulation applies to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad us federal authorities including the food and drug administration fda the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency epa regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local level and comparable authorities overseas 

while it is our policy and practice to comply with all regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our european competition matters see item 3 “ legal proceedings ” and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition new or more stringent regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used in colgate total toothpaste and certain of our liquid and bar soaps is an example of an ingredient which has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities around the world the reviews by regulatory authorities of triclosan and other ingredients continue to support their current uses in our products however a finding by a regulatory authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could have a material adverse impact on our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to timely obtain regulatory approval of new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients could likewise have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities 

the company is engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business in addition if our products or raw materials contained in our products are found or perceived to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products such a recall could cause our reputation and brand image to be diminished and consequently we could lose market share or become subject to liability claims any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact the company’s ability to conduct business 

the company relies extensively on information technology systems including some which rely on thirdparty service providers in order to conduct business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping products to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business although the company has network security measures in place the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including the poor performance or failure of thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages security breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in the ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company’s business 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our future operations could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business may be materially adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time

executive overview and outlook 

colgatepalmolive company seeks to deliver strong consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable 

to this end the company is tightly focused on two product segments oral personal and home care and pet nutrition within these segments the company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories these product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable longterm growth 

operationally the company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region the company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the company’s sales and profitability this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world 

the oral personal and home care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments north america latin america europesouth pacific and greater asiaafrica all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors the company through hill’s pet nutrition also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market selling its products principally through specialty pet retailers and the veterinary profession 

on an ongoing basis management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance these indicators include market share sales including volume pricing and foreign exchange components organic sales growth net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestments gross profit margin operating profit net income and earnings per share as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital capital expenditures cash flow and return on capital the monitoring of these indicators and the company’s corporate governance practices including the company’s code of conduct help to maintain business health and strong internal controls 

to achieve its business and financial objectives the company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth the company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis to enhance these efforts the company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the company’s products 

the investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses the company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses specifically oral care personal care and pet nutrition 

 

as disclosed in “item 1a risk factors” with approximately 75 of its net sales generated outside of the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results

in particular as a result of the devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte described more fully in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements the local currency operations of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary cp venezuela now translate into fewer us dollars which had and will continue to have an adverse effect on the company’s reported results the company has taken and continues to take actions to mitigate the impact of both devaluations on its operations additionally the venezuelan government continues to impose currency exchange controls and during 2010 a new currency market was established which replaced the freefloating parallel market although cp venezuela continues to have limited access to us dollars at the official rate and currently only for imported goods under the current restrictions it is not permitted to access the new currency market the company’s business in venezuela and our ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional currency exchange controls for the year ended december 31 2010 cp venezuela represented 4 of the company’s consolidated net sales at december 31 2010 cp venezuela’s monetary local currency net asset position was approximately 200 

looking forward we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive the company has recently experienced heightened competitive activity in certain markets from other large multinational companies some of which may have greater resources than we do such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending additionally we have experienced a sharp rise in commodity costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to address the heightened competitive activity and increased commodity costs should these conditions persist they could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company’s strategic initiatives getting closer to the consumer the profession and customers effectiveness and efficiency in everything innovation everywhere and leadership this focus together with the strength of the company’s global brand names and its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the longterm

net cash provided by operations in 2010 was 3211 as compared with 3277 in 2009 and 2302 in 2008 the decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to increased working capital the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflects improved profitability decreased working capital and lower cash spending related to the 2004 restructuring program partially offset by higher tax payments

financing activities used 2624 of cash during 2010 compared to 2270 and 1530 during 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and dividends paid partially offset by higher net proceeds from issuances of debt the increase in 2009 was primarily due to higher net debt payments and an increase in dividends paid 

longterm debt increased to 3376 as of december 31 2010 as compared to 3147 as of december 31 2009 and total debt increased to 3424 as of december 31 2010 as compared to 3182 as of december 31 2009 during the fourth quarter of 2010 the company issued 250 of tenyear notes at a fixed rate of 295 and 188 of fiveyear notes at a fixed rate of 1375 under the company’s shelf registration statement proceeds from the debt issuances were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings during the third quarter of 2009 the company issued 300 of us dollardenominated sixyear notes at a fixed rate of 315 under the company’s shelf registration statement proceeds from the debt issuance were used to reduce commercial paper and other borrowings

following is a summary of the company’s commercial paper and global shortterm borrowings as of december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

certain of the facilities with respect to the company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as crossdefault provisions noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the company’s longterm debt and credit facilities

longterm liabilities associated with the company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements various economic assumptions the most significant of which are detailed in “critical accounting policies and use of estimates” below and voluntary company contributions based on current information the company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified us pension plan until 2012 management’s best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the company’s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending december 31 2011 is approximately 208 including approximately 100 of voluntary contributions to our us pension plans 

additionally liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information

managing foreign currency interest rate and commodity price exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below see notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

  

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company’s foreign currency exposures primarily reflect the company’s operations in latin america 27 of net sales europesouth pacific 21 of net sales and asiaafrica 19 of net sales the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries other than those operating in highly inflationary environments are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments currently venezuela inventories prepaids goodwill and property plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at yearend exchange rates remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward option and swap contracts local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized losses of 3 at december 31 2010 and net unrealized gains of 4 at december 31 2009 changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2010 an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 40 

  

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

interest rate risk 

the company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2010 variable rate debt levels a 1percentagepoint increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense net by 14 in 2010 

  

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins tallow essential oils tropical oils corn and soybeans the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

the company’s open commodity derivative contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 4 and 0 for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively at the end of 2010 an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have reduced the net unrealized gain to 2 

  

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely as it is the company’s policy to contract with highly rated diverse counterparties 

recent accounting pronouncements 

no new accounting pronouncement issued or which became effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories 

  

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

 

 

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits stock options asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies 

 

average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 12 5 5 7 and 8 respectively in addition the current rate of return assumption for the us plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 40 in fixed income securities 52 in equity securities and 8 in real estate and alternative investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 2 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 7 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 40 as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

we operate on a global basis with approximately 75 of our net sales coming from markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition we monitor our foreign currency exposure to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging we cannot provide assurances however that these measures will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 

for example our results of operations will be adversely impacted by the recent designation of venezuela as hyperinflationary and the subsequent currency devaluation in venezuela exchange controls in venezuela could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations for additional information regarding the potential impact of the risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview and outlook” and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

  uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 

uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flow although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 

while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business 

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

we face vigorous competition around the world including from other large multinational consumer product companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities advertising and new product introductions 

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such activities or initiatives by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such activities and initiatives may affect our financial performance in the relevant period our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to protect our patent trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental initiatives and other conditions in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soap 

  

  

the growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of new products 

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can 

 

 

 

 

 

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in the company not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins tallow corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry government and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives in particular adverse publicity about product safety or quality and similar types of concerns real or imagined or the allegations of product contamination or tampering whether or not valid may result in a product recall or reduced demand for our products a significant product recall could tarnish the image of the affected brands and cause consumers to choose other products 

 

 

in addition from time to time third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products to the extent that third parties sell products that are counterfeit versions of our brands consumers of our brands could confuse our products with products that they consider inferior or that pose safety risks which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business 

similarly adverse publicity regarding our responses to health concerns our environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution advertising and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation in the us and abroad this regulation includes but is not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if a claim is unsuccessful is not merited or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our european competition matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

we comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacture and sale of the products we currently market new or more restrictive regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations however could have an adverse impact on our business for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of certain ingredients in consumer products including triclosan a finding by a regulatory authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could have an adverse impact on our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients currently colgate uses triclosan in certain of its oral personal and home care products including colgate total toothpaste softsoap brand liquid hand soap palmolive dish liquid and protex bar soap 

  

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities 

the company is engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business in addition if our products or raw materials contained in our products are found or perceived to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products our reputation and brand image could be diminished and we could lose market share or become subject to liability claims any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

 

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our future operations could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business may be materially adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time

european competition matters

the company’s policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and if a violation of any such laws is found to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry the company has undertaken a comprehensive review of its selling practices and related competition law compliance in europe and elsewhere and where the company has identified a lack of compliance it has undertaken remedial action competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and can result in substantial fines for violations that are found such fines depending on the gravity and duration of the infringement as well as the value of the sales involved have amounted in some cases to hundreds of millions of dollars while the company cannot predict the final financial impact of these competition law issues as these matters may change the company has taken and will as necessary take additional reserves as and when appropriate

executive overview and outlook 

colgatepalmolive company seeks to deliver strong consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable 

to this end the company is tightly focused on two product segments oral personal and home care and pet nutrition within these segments the company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories these product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable longterm growth 

operationally the company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region the company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the company’s sales and profitability this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world 

the oral personal and home care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments north america latin america europesouth pacific and greater asiaafrica all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors the company through hill’s pet nutrition also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers 

on an ongoing basis management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance these indicators include market share sales including volume pricing and foreign exchange components organic sales growth gross profit margin operating profit net income and earnings per share as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital capital expenditures cash flow and return on capital the monitoring of these indicators and the company’s corporate governance practices including the company’s code of conduct help to maintain business health and strong internal controls

to achieve its business and financial objectives the company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth the company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis to enhance these efforts the company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers growth opportunities are greater in emerging markets where economic development is likely to expand the markets for the company’s products 

the investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses the company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses specifically oral care personal care and pet nutrition 

the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace and looking forward expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging as disclosed in “item 1a risk factors” with approximately 75 of its net sales generated outside of the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results 

venezuela has been designated hyperinflationary effective january 1 2010 consequently the functional currency for the company’s venezuelan subsidiary will be the us dollar and the impact of all future venezuelan currency fluctuations will be recorded in income see “managing foreign currency interest rate and commodity price exposure—foreign exchange risk” below and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

also on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government announced its decision to devalue its currency and implement a twotier exchange rate structure as a result the official exchange rate changed from 215 to 260 for essential goods and 430 for nonessential goods while we currently believe that many of our products may receive the 260 rate of exchange we will remeasure the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary for 2010 and future periods at the rate at which we expect to remit dividends which currently is 430 while difficult to project our preliminary estimate is that the impact of the devaluation will be a net reduction in 2010 diluted earnings per share of between 006 and 010 per share this includes the ongoing negative impact from foreign exchange translation partially offset by onetime benefits from lower taxes on accrued but unpaid remittances and the remeasurement of the local balance sheet at the devaluation date as actual results may differ please see “cautionary statement on forwardlooking statements” below the venezuelan government continues to impose currency exchange controls we could be negatively affected if we are unable to obtain us dollars at either of the official rates in which case we may have to obtain dollars through transactions on the parallel market where the exchange rate is less favorable in 2009 our venezuelan operations contributed 6 of consolidated net sales 

lower commodity and oil prices as compared with 2008 had a favorable impact on the company’s results for 2009 the company believes that this effect should continue in 2010 and coupled with ongoing aggressive savings programs and favorable currency trends should offset the impact of any pressures on selling prices or the costs of any consumption building programs that may be implemented to drive volume given the uncertain economic environment however continued difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact the company’s suppliers customers and consumers which could in turn have an adverse impact on the company’s business

as a result of the company’s fouryear restructuring and businessbuilding program the 2004 restructuring program which was finalized as of december 31 2008 the company streamlined its global supply chain reallocated resources to enhance its sales marketing and new product organizations in highpotential developing countries and other key markets and consolidated these organizations in certain mature markets the savings and benefits from the 2004 restructuring program along with the company’s other ongoing costsavings and growth initiatives are providing funds for investment in support of key categories and markets and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability 

the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company’s strategic initiatives getting closer to the consumer the profession and customers effectiveness and efficiency in everything innovation everywhere and leadership this focus together with the strength of the company’s global brand names and its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the longterm

managing foreign currency interest rate and commodity price exposure 

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selling price increases selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives for any purpose as well as derivatives for trading purposes 

the sensitivity of our financial instruments to these market fluctuations is discussed below see note 2 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 

foreign exchange risk 

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar our foreign currency exposures reflect the company’s operations in the markets in latin america 28 of net sales europesouth pacific 21 of net sales and asiaafrica 17 of net sales the company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the “results of operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each segment 

the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries other than those operating in highly inflationary environments are translated into us dollars at yearend exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 

for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments inventories prepaids goodwill and property plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at yearend exchange rates remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income 

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts including forward and swap contracts local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable forward rates 

 

 

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

 

our foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of 4 at december 31 2009 and net unrealized losses of 5 at december 31 2008 changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings at the end of 2009 an unfavorable 10 change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of 17 

  

interest rate risk 

the company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 

based on yearend 2009 variable rate debt levels a 1percentagepoint increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense net by 10 in 2009 

commodity price risk 

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins tallow corn and soybeans the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts futures contracts are used on a limited basis primarily in the pet nutrition segment to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 

our open commodity derivative contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized losses of 0 and 7 for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively at the end of 2009 an unfavorable 10 change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in an unrealized net loss of 1 

credit risk 

the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely as it is the company’s policy to contract with highly rated diverse counterparties

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories 

 

 

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits stock options asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities 

  

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with approximately 75 of our net sales coming from markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows and financial condition we monitor our foreign currency exposure to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign 

  

currency rate movements through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging we cannot provide assurances however that these measures will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 

  

we face risks associated with the current global credit crisis and economic downturn 

  

the continuing volatility in the financial markets and the economic downturn in markets throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities credit markets have recently experienced significant disruptions and certain leading financial institutions have either declared bankruptcy or have shown significant deterioration in their financial stability further deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive if any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn impact our business 

  

in addition although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during the economic downturn accordingly the current economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

  

we face vigorous competition around the world including from other large multinational consumer product companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such activities or initiatives by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such activities and initiatives may affect our financial performance in the relevant period our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands on whether we can attract and retain key talent and on our ability to protect our patent trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

  

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

  

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing an increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and 

  

some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products and other conditions in addition private label brands sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices are a potential source of competition for certain of our product lines 

  

the growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of new products 

  

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

  

rising material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

  

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins tallow corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

  

damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety and quality initiatives in particular adverse publicity about product safety or quality and similar types of concerns real or imagined or the allegations of product contamination or tampering whether or not valid may result in a product recall or reduced demand for our products a significant product recall could tarnish the image of the affected brands and cause consumers to choose other products 

  

in addition from time to time third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products to the extent that third parties sell products that are counterfeit versions of our brands consumers of our brands could confuse our products with products that they consider inferior or that pose safety risks which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business 

  

similarly adverse publicity regarding our responses to health concerns our environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 

  

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

  

the manufacture packaging labeling storage distribution advertising and sale of consumer products are subject to extensive regulation in the us and abroad this regulation includes but is not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if a claim is unsuccessful is not merited or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our european competition matters see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

we have obtained all necessary regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell our currently marketed products new or more restrictive regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations however could have an adverse impact on our business for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries conduct reviews of the use of triclosan in certain consumer products in 2005 the fda established an advisory panel to examine the use of certain antimicrobials including triclosan in antimicrobial hand soaps wipes and hand sanitizers also the european commission ec is examining the use of triclosan in consumer products a finding by the fda the ec or another overseas regulatory authority that triclosan should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be regulated could have an adverse impact on our business as could negative reactions to triclosan from consumers our trade customers or nongovernmental organizations currently colgate uses triclosan in certain of its oral personal and home care products including colgate total toothpaste softsoap brand liquid hand soap and protex bar soap 

  

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business in addition if our products or raw materials contained in our products are found or perceived to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products our reputation and brand image could be diminished and we could lose market share or become subject to liability claims any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 

  

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our future operations could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer our business may be materially adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time 

  

the risks described above are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the above risks actually occurs our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend   

in 2001 the central bank of brazil sought to impose a substantial fine on the company’s brazilian subsidiary approximately 112 million at current exchange rates based on alleged foreign exchange violations in connection with the financing of the company’s 1995 acquisition of the kolynos oral care business from wyeth formerly american home products the seller as described in the company’s form 8k dated january 10 1995 the company appealed the imposition of the fine to the brazilian monetary system appeals council the council and on january 30 2007 the council decided the appeal in the company’s favor dismissing the fine entirely certain tax and civil proceedings that began as a result of this central bank matter are still outstanding as described below 

  

the brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the company’s brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition the tax assessments with interest at the current exchange rate approximate 97 million the company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authority’s appellate process with the following results to date 

  

   

   

in the event of an adverse decision within the internal revenue authority’s appellate process further appeals are available within the brazilian federal courts although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel and other advisors that the disallowances are without merit and that the company should prevail on appeal either at the administrative level or if necessary in the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously 

  

in 2002 the brazilian federal public attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of brazil laboratorios wyethwhitehall ltda the brazilian subsidiary of the seller and the company as represented by its brazilian subsidiary seeking to annul an april 2000 decision by the brazilian board of tax appeals that found in favor of the seller’s brazilian subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of kolynos the action seeks to make the company’s brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the seller’s brazilian subsidiary although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that the company should ultimately prevail in this action the company intends to challenge this action vigorously 

  

in december 2005 the brazilian internal revenue authority issued to the company’s brazilian subsidiary a tax assessment with interest and penalties of approximately 50 million at the current exchange rate based on a claim that certain purchases of us treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions the company is disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authority’s administrative appeals process in october 2007 the second board of taxpayers which has jurisdiction over these matters ruled in favor of the internal revenue authority in january 2008 the company appealed this decision to the next administrative level although there can be no assurances management believes based on the advice of its brazilian legal counsel that the tax assessment is without merit and that the company should prevail either through administrative appeal or if necessary through further appeal in the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge this assessment vigorously 

  

during the period from february 2006 to january 2009 the company learned that investigations relating to potential competition law violations involving the company’s subsidiaries had been commenced by governmental authorities in the european union france germany greece italy the netherlands romania spain switzerland and the united kingdom in february 2008 the federal competition authority in germany imposed fines on four of the company’s competitors but the company was not fined due to its cooperation with the german authorities consistent with the company’s policy to cooperate with the authorities in such matters as discussed below the company understands that many of these investigations also involve other consumer goods companies andor retail customers at this time no formal claim for a fine or penalty has been made against the company in any of the above matters except for the swiss matter where the swiss authority has initially proposed a fine of approximately 5 million at the current exchange rate the company’s policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and if a violation of any such laws is found to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry the company has undertaken a comprehensive review of its selling practices and related competition law compliance in europe and elsewhere and where the company has identified a lack of compliance it is undertaking remedial action competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and can result in substantial fines for violations that are found such fines depending on the gravity and duration of the infringement as well as the value of the sales involved have amounted in some cases to hundreds of millions of dollars while the company cannot predict the final financial impact of these competition law issues as these matters may change the company has taken and will as necessary take additional reserves as and when appropriate 

  

in october 2007 a putative class action claiming that certain aspects of the cash balance portion of the colgatepalmolive company employees’ retirement income plan the plan do not comply with the employee retirement income security act was filed against the plan and the company in the united states district court for the southern district of new york specifically proesel et al v colgatepalmolive company employees’ retirement income plan et al alleges improper calculation of lump sum distributions age discrimination and failure to satisfy minimum accrual requirements thereby resulting in the underpayment of benefits to plan participants two other putative class actions filed earlier in 2007 abelman et al v colgatepalmolive company employees’ retirement income plan et al  in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio and caufield v colgatepalmolive company employees’ retirement income plan  in the united states district court for the southern district of indiana both alleging improper calculation of lump sum distributions and in the case of abelman  claims for failure to satisfy minimum accrual requirements were transferred to the southern district of new york and consolidated with proesel into one action in re colgatepalmolive erisa litigation  the complaint in the consolidated action alleges improper calculation of lump sum distributions and failure to satisfy minimum accrual requirements but does not include a claim for age discrimination the relief sought includes recalculation of benefits in unspecified amounts pre and postjudgment interest injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees this action has not been certified as a class action as yet the company and the plan intend to contest this action vigorously

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

executive overview 

  

colgatepalmolive company seeks to deliver strong consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable 

  

to this end the company is tightly focused on two product segments oral personal and home care and pet nutrition within these segments the company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories these product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable longterm growth 

  

operationally the company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region the company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the company’s sales and profitability this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world 

  

the oral personal and home care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments north america latin america europesouth pacific and greater asiaafrica all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors the company through hill’s pet nutrition also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers 

  

on an ongoing basis management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance these indicators include market share sales including volume pricing and foreign exchange components gross profit margin operating profit net income and earnings per share as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital capital expenditures cash flow and return on capital the monitoring of these indicators as well as the company’s corporate governance practices including the company’s code of conduct are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained 

  

to achieve its business and financial objectives the company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth the company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis to enhance these efforts the company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the company’s products 

  

the investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses the company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses specifically oral care personal care and pet nutrition 

  

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

  

consistent with the company’s strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses in the fourth quarter of 2006 the company announced its agreement to sell its household bleach businesses in latin america and canada the transaction closed in canada during the fourth quarter of 2006 in the latin american countries the transaction closed during the first quarter of 2007 with the exception of colombia where the transaction did not receive regulatory approval 

  

the company’s previously announced 2004 restructuring program to enhance the company’s global leadership position in its core businesses was finalized as of december 31 2008 since the inception of the 2004 restructuring program the company has incurred total pretax cumulative charges of 10692 7755 aftertax savings are estimated to be in the range of 475 and 500 pretax 350 and 375 aftertax annually substantially all of which will increase future cash flows 

  

as a result of the 2004 restructuring program we streamlined our global supply chain reallocated resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales marketing and new product organizations in highpotential developing countries and other key markets and consolidated these organizations in certain mature markets the savings and benefits from the 2004 restructuring program along with our other ongoing costsavings and growth initiatives are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability 

  

as further explained in the “outlook” section below while we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging in 2009 we believe the company is wellpositioned to deliver increased shareholder value over the longterm

managing foreign currency interest rate and commodity price exposure 

  

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes 

  

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company’s major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in europe asiaafrica and certain latin american countries although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging in an effort to minimize the impact of foreign currency rate movements on earnings 

  

the company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts crosscurrency interest rate swaps local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business as well as the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries from time to time the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts and currency options these contracts generally have durations no greater than 18 months and are valued using observable forward rates in commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the contracts 

  

interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the swaps 

  

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins tallow corn and soybeans futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases these contracts generally have durations no greater than 18 months and are valued using quoted commodity exchange prices

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as it is the company’s policy to contract with highly rated diversified counterparties the company’s consideration of nonperformance risk as it relates to financial instruments includes a review of available market information in addition to published debt ratings such as probability of default ratings and credit default swap spreads 

  

value at risk 

  

the company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate foreign exchange and commodity price exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a valueatrisk var model and an earningsatrisk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate foreign exchange and commoditybased financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur given a 95 confidence level historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate foreign exchange rate or commoditybased instruments calculated using the var model is not material to the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company in 2008 and 2007 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate foreign exchange rate or commoditybased instruments calculated utilizing the ear model is not material to the company’s consolidated results of operations in 2008 and 2007 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies 

  

outlook 

  

looking forward into 2009 the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration in addition changes in economic conditions movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries could impact future operating results 

  

while the recent strengthening of the us dollar is expected to negatively impact the company’s results in 2009 the company believes most if not all of the impact should be offset over the course of the year the extent to which the company is able to offset the effect of the strengthened us dollar will be impacted by the sustainability of benefits from recent commodity cost declines and the company’s ability to successfully implement selling price increases and costsavings initiatives moreover difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact our suppliers customers and consumers which could in turn have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our recent finalization of the 2004 restructuring program should enhance our ability to compete successfully in the current environment as a result of the 2004 restructuring program the company streamlined its global supply chain reallocated resources to enhance the sales marketing and new product organizations in highpotential developing countries and other key markets and consolidated these organizations in certain mature markets the savings and benefits from the 2004 restructuring program along with the company’s other ongoing costsavings and growth initiatives are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and markets new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability 

  

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

  

accordingly we believe we are wellprepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition our experience operating in challenging environments and our continued focus on our strategic initiatives getting closer to the consumer the profession and our customers effectiveness and efficiency in everything innovation everywhere and leadership this focus together with the strength of our global brand names and our broad international presence in both mature and developing markets should position us well to increase shareholder value over the longterm

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities 

  

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with approximately 75 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition we monitor our foreign currency exposure to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements 

  

through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs we cannot provide assurances however that these measures will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operation 

  

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

  

we face vigorous competition around the world including from other large multinational consumer product companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such activities or initiatives by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such activities and initiatives may affect our financial performance in the relevant period our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands on whether we can attract and retain key talent and on our ability to protect our patent trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

  

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

  

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing an increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products and other conditions in addition private label brands sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices are a source of competition for certain of our product lines 

  

the growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of new products 

  

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

  

rising material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

  

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins tallow corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

  

our results could suffer if we do not implement our 2004 restructuring program according to our expectations 

  

in december 2004 we commenced the 2004 restructuring program a fouryear restructuring and businessbuilding program to enhance our global leadership position in our core businesses while the company is three years into the implementation of this program and many of the projects under the program have successfully been implemented or are nearing completion its ongoing implementation will continue to present significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations and business partners who may provide us manufacturing or administrative services we cannot provide assurances that 

  

   

   

   

a failure to implement the remaining elements of the 2004 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our profitability

in 1995 the company acquired the kolynos oral care business from wyeth formerly american home products the seller as described in the company’s form 8k dated january 10 1995 on september 8 1998 the company’s brazilian subsidiary received notice of an administrative proceeding from the central bank of brazil primarily taking issue with certain foreign exchange filings made with the central bank in connection with the financing of this strategic transaction but in no way challenging or seeking to unwind the acquisition the central bank of brazil in january 2001 notified the company of its decision in this administrative proceeding to impose a fine which at the current exchange rate approximates 147 million the company appealed the imposition of the fine to the brazilian monetary system appeals council the council and on january 30 2007 the council decided the appeal in the company’s favor dismissing the fine entirely 

  

in addition the brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the company’s brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition the tax assessments with interest at the current exchange rate approximate 123 million the company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authority’s appellate process with the following results to date 

  

   

   

in the event of an adverse decision within the internal revenue authority’s appellate process further appeals are available within the brazilian federal courts although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel and other experts that the disallowances are without merit and that the company should prevail on appeal either at the administrative level or if necessary in the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously 

  

in addition brazilian prosecutors reviewed the foregoing transactions as part of an overall examination of all international transfers of reais through nonresident current accounts during the 1992 to 1998 time frame a 

  

review that the company understands involved hundreds and possibly thousands of other individuals and companies unrelated to the company at the request of these prosecutors in february 2004 a federal judge agreed to authorize criminal charges against certain current and former officers of the company’s brazilian subsidiary based on the same allegations made in the central bank and tax proceedings discussed above management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that these officers behaved in all respects properly and in accordance with the law in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition management intends to support and defend these officers vigorously

in december 2005 the brazilian internal revenue authority issued to the company’s brazilian subsidiary a tax assessment with interest and penalties of approximately 64 million at the current exchange rate based on a claim that certain purchases of us treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period of 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions the company is disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authority’s administrative appeals process in october 2007 the second board of taxpayers ruled in favor of the internal revenue authority the company intends to appeal this decision to the next administrative level although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that the tax assessment is without merit and that the company should prevail either through administrative appeal or if necessary through further appeal in the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge this assessment vigorously

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of 

  

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

  

techniques including working capital management selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes 

  

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company’s major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in europe asiaafrica and certain latin american countries although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements 

  

the company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts crosscurrency interest rate swaps local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business from time to time the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts and currency options with durations no greater than 18 months 

  

interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 

  

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production such as resins tallow corn and soybeans futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases in 2007 the results of the company’s commodity hedging activities were not material

value at risk 

  

the company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate foreign exchange and commodity price exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a valueatrisk var model and an earningsatrisk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate foreign exchange and commoditybased financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur given a 95 confidence level historical interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate foreign exchange rate or commoditybased instruments calculated using the var model is not material to the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company in 2007 and 2006 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate foreign exchange rate or commoditybased instruments calculated utilizing the ear model is not material to the company’s results of operations in 2007 and 2006 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

critical accounting policies and use of estimates

 item 1a   risk factors tableend   

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities 

  

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with approximately 75 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

we monitor our foreign currency exposure to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs we cannot provide assurances however that these measures will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements 

  

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

  

we face vigorous competition around the world including from other large multinational consumer product companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such activities or initiatives by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such activities and initiatives may affect our financial performance in the relevant period our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our patent trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

  

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

  

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation especially in developed markets such as the us and europe we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products and other conditions in addition private label brands sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices are a source of competition for certain of our product lines 

  

the growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of new products 

  

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

  

rising material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

  

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins tallow corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs of these commodities and other costs such as energy costs may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time 

  

our results could suffer if we do not implement our 2004 restructuring program according to our expectations 

  

in december 2004 we commenced the 2004 restructuring program a fouryear restructuring and businessbuilding program to enhance our global leadership position in our core businesses while the company is two years into the implementation of this program its ongoing implementation will continue to present significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations and business partners who may provide us manufacturing or administrative services we cannot provide assurances that 

  

   

   

   

a failure to implement the remaining elements of the 2004 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our profitability 

  

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

  

the manufacture and sale of consumer products is subject to extensive regulation in the us and abroad this regulation includes but is not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we have obtained all required regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell our products new or more restrictive regulations however could have an adverse impact on our business for example while the fda has approved the use of triclosan in colgate total toothpaste the use of triclosan in certain consumer products is under regulatory review in europe and in certain other countries also in the us the fda is examining the use of certain antimicrobials including triclosan in antimicrobial hand soaps a finding by the fda or an overseas 

  

regulatory authority that triclosan should not be used in certain consumer products could have an adverse impact on our business as could negative reactions to triclosan from consumers our trade customers or nongovernmental organizations 

  

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing activities 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

  

acquisitions may not be successful 

  

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions acquisitions have inherent risks including but not limited to whether we can 

  

   

   

   

depending on the significance of the acquisition the failure to achieve expected synergies or projections could have an adverse effect on our results 

  

the risks described above are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the above risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend   

in 1995 the company acquired the kolynos oral care business from wyeth formerly american home products the seller as described in the company’s form 8k dated january 10 1995 on september 8 1998 the company’s brazilian subsidiary received notice of an administrative proceeding from the central bank of brazil primarily taking issue with certain foreign exchange filings made with the central bank in connection with the financing of this strategic transaction but in no way challenging or seeking to unwind the acquisition the central bank of brazil in january 2001 notified the company of its decision in this administrative proceeding to impose a fine which at the current exchange rate approximates 120 million the company appealed the imposition of the fine to the brazilian monetary system appeals council the council and on january 30 2007 the council decided the appeal in the company’s favor dismissing the fine entirely 

  

in addition the brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the company’s brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition the tax assessments with interest at the current exchange rate approximate 100 million the company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authority’s appellate process with the following results to date 

  

   

   

in the event of an adverse decision within the internal revenue authority’s appellate process further appeals are available within the brazilian federal courts although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel and other experts that the disallowances are without merit and that the company should prevail on appeal either at the administrative level or if necessary in the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously 

  

in addition brazilian prosecutors reviewed the foregoing transactions as part of an overall examination of all international transfers of reais through nonresident current accounts during the 1992 to 1998 time frame a 

  

review which the company understands involved hundreds and possibly thousands of other individuals and companies unrelated to the company at the request of these prosecutors in february 2004 a federal judge agreed to authorize criminal charges against certain current and former officers of the company’s brazilian subsidiary based on the same allegations made in the central bank and tax proceedings discussed above management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that these officers behaved in all respects properly and in accordance with the law in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition management intends to support and defend these officers vigorously 

  

in 2002 the brazilian federal public attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of brazil laboratorios wyethwhitehall ltda the brazilian subsidiary of the seller and the company as represented by its brazilian subsidiary seeking to annul an april 2000 decision by the brazilian board of tax appeals that found in favor of the seller’s subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of kolynos the action seeks to make the company’s brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the seller’s subsidiary although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that the company should ultimately prevail in this action the company intends to challenge this action vigorously 

  

in december 2005 the brazilian internal revenue authority issued to the company’s brazilian subsidiary a tax assessment with interest and penalties of approximately 50 million at the current exchange rate based on a claim that certain purchases of us treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent sale during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions the company is disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authority’s administrative appeals process although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that the tax assessment is without merit and that the company should prevail either through administrative appeal or if necessary through further appeal in the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge this assessment vigorously 

  

in february 2006 the company learned that french competition authorities initiated an inquiry into potential competition law violations in france involving exchanges of competitive information and agreements on selling terms and conditions among a number of consumer goods companies in france including the company’s french subsidiary in february 2007 the company learned that the swiss competition authorities will open an investigation against the company’s gaba holding ag gaba subsidiary regarding distribution policies retail pricing and parallel trade at this time no formal claim for a fine or penalty has been made in either matter the company’s policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and if a violation of any such laws is found to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry the company has undertaken a comprehensive review of its selling practices and related competition law compliance in europe and elsewhere and where the company has identified a lack of compliance it is undertaking remedial action while the company cannot predict the final financial impact of these competition law issues as these matters are still under review and may change the company has taken and will if necessary take additional reserves as appropriate

cash flow 

  

net cash provided by operations in 2006 was 18215 as compared with 17844 in 2005 and 17543 in 2004 the increase in 2006 reflects the company’s improved profitability partially offset by changes in working capital higher tax payments and increased spending related to the 2004 restructuring program 

  

the company’s working capital as a percentage of sales increased to 23 of sales in 2006 as compared with 17 of sales in 2005 the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets excluding cash and marketable securities the latter of which is reported in other current assets and current liabilities excluding shortterm debt the company’s working capital changes were driven in part by increased inventory levels higher accounts receivable balances and higher tax payments offset by higher levels of payables and accruals inventory days coverage ratio increased to 69 in 2006 as compared to 61 in 2005 largely as a result of efforts to ensure continued product supply during factory closings related to the 2004 restructuring program higher balances in accounts receivables were due primarily to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a slight increase in days sales outstanding over the prior year partly due to timing higher tax payments were the result of improved profitability as well as the timing of payments a portion of tax payments for calendar year 2005 were made in 2006 including tax payments of approximately 20 relating to the sale of the company’s southeast asian detergent brands in the fourth quarter of 2005 

  

investing activities used 6204 of cash during 2006 compared with uses of 2207 and 10904 during 2005 and 2004 respectively the change over 2005 is primarily due to higher payments in 2006 associated with acquisitions versus higher proceeds in 2005 associated with divestitures along with increased capital spending in 2006 

  

in 2006 the company purchased 84 of the outstanding shares of tom’s of maine inc for approximately 100 plus transaction costs additionally the company increased its ownership interests in its poland and romania subsidiaries to 100 at a cost of approximately 95 in 2005 the company increased its ownership interests in certain subsidiaries to 100 at a cost of 385 primarily related to its malaysia subsidiary in 2004 payments for acquisitions pertained to the purchase of 100 of the outstanding shares of gaba

capital expenditures were 4764 3892 and 3481 for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively capital spending is trending upwards as a result of the company’s multiyear restructuring and businessbuilding program and continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns overall capital expenditures for 2007 are expected to increase to a rate of approximately 5 of net sales 

  

financing activities used 10590 of cash during 2006 compared to 15244 and 6111 during 2005 and 2004 respectively financing activities in 2006 reflect higher proceeds from exercise of stock options which more than offset an increase in common and preference stock dividend payments as well as higher share repurchases associated with the share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors in 2006 and 2004 additionally debt increased 1391 net of payments in 2006 versus a decrease of 784 net of proceeds in 2005

managing foreign currency interest rate and commodity price exposure 

  

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions issued with standard features in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes 

  

as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company’s major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in europe and certain latin american countries although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar the company monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements 

  

the company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts crosscurrency interest rate swaps local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business from time to time the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months 

  

interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 

  

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases in 2006 the results of the company’s commodity hedging activities were not material 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a longterm debt rating of aaaa3 or higher 

  

value at risk 

  

the company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a valueatrisk var model and an earningsatrisk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur given a 95 confidence level historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated using the var model is not material to the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company in 2006 and 2005 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated utilizing the ear model is not material to the

company’s results of operations in 2006 and 2005 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which prescribes accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions this interpretation defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and the measurement of tax benefits recognized the provisions of fin 48 are effective as of the beginning of the company’s 2007 fiscal year with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings the company is currently finalizing its analysis of the impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting fin 48 and believes that the impact if any will not be material 

  

refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories 

  

   

   

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits stock options asset impairment tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies 

  

outlook 

  

looking forward into 2007 while the company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive it believes it is well positioned for continued growth it anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share the 2004 restructuring program is designed to enhance the company’s global leadership position in its core businesses as part of the 2004 restructuring program the company is in the process of streamlining its global supply chain reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales marketing and new product organizations in highpotential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets the savings and benefits from the 2004 restructuring program along with the company’s other ongoing costsavings and growth initiatives are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability 

  

however as noted above the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation in addition changes in economic conditions movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in us dollars in particular economic and political uncertainty in some countries in latin america and changes in the value of latin american and european currencies may impact the overall results of these regions historically the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries over the longterm the company’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value

 item 1a   risk factors tableend   

set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities 

  

we face risks associated with significant international operations 

  

we operate on a global basis with approximately 74 of our net sales coming from operations outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company’s exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

we monitor our foreign currency exposure to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs we cannot assure you however that these measures will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements 

  

significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 

  

we face vigorous competition around the world including from other large multinational consumer product companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such activities or initiatives by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such activities and initiatives may affect our financial performance in the relevant period our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands whether we can attract and retain key talent and our ability to protect our patent trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

  

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

  

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation especially in developed markets such as the us and europe we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products and other conditions in addition private label brands sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices are a source of competition for certain of our product lines 

  

the growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of new products 

  

our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business also any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position 

  

rising material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 

  

raw and packaging material commodities such as resins tallow corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs of these commodities and other costs such as energy costs may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time 

  

our results could suffer if we do not implement our 2004 restructuring program according to our expectations 

  

in december 2004 we commenced the 2004 restructuring program a fouryear restructuring and businessbuilding program to enhance our global leadership position in our core businesses this program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations and business partners who may provide us manufacturing or administrative services we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

a failure to implement the 2004 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our profitability 

  

our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 

  

the manufacture and sale of consumer products is subject to extensive regulation in the us and abroad this regulation includes but is not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we have obtained all required regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell our products new or more restrictive regulations however could have an adverse impact on our business for example while the fda has approved the use of triclosan in colgate total toothpaste the use of triclosan in certain consumer products is under regulatory review in europe and in certain other countries also in the us the fda is examining the use of certain antimicrobials including triclosan in antimicrobial hand soaps a finding by the fda or an overseas regulatory authority that triclosan should not be used in certain consumer products could have an adverse impact on our business as could negative reactions to triclosan from consumers our trade customers or nongovernmental organizations 

  

our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing activities 

  

as a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our manufacturing sites which are strategically located around the world significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

  

acquisitions may not be successful 

  

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions such as the june 2004 acquisition of gaba a european oral care company acquisitions have inherent risks including but not limited to whether we can 

  

   

   

   

depending on the significance of the acquisition the failure to achieve expected synergies or projections could have an adverse effect on our results 

  

the risks described above are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the above risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

other income expense net 

  

other income expense net was 692 903 and 150 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the components of other income expense net are presented below 

  

   

other income expense net in 2005 included a gain of 1479 on the sale of heavyduty laundry detergent businesses in north america and southeast asia which was partially offset by charges related to the company’s 2004 restructuring program of 808 and pension and other postretirement charges of 340 the charges associated with certain pension and other postretirement obligations were primarily a result of the conversion of one of the company’s international pension plans to a defined contribution plan for all eligible participants and a lump sum payment of normal retirement benefits associated with a retirement plan in the us as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 88 “employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits” sfas 88

interest expense net 

  

interest expense net was 1360 in 2005 compared with 1197 in 2004 and 1241 in 2003 higher interest rates and higher average debt levels primarily to finance the gaba acquisition have resulted in increased interest expense in 2005 in 2004 low interest rates allowed the company to lower its interest expense despite increased debt levels resulting from the gaba acquisition 

  

income taxes 

  

the effective income tax rate was 350 in 2005 versus 337 in 2004 and 304 in 2003 the higher tax rate in 2005 is due to 409 of income taxes 200 bps for the incremental repatriation of 780 of foreign earnings related to the american jobs creation act of 2004 the ajca as well as the impact 130 bps of the lower effective benefit rate on charges incurred in connection with the company’s 2004 restructuring program these increases were partially offset by the company’s global tax planning strategies which are reflected principally in overseas earnings being taxed at lower rates 

  

the increase in 2004 is due in part to changes in the mix of income in foreign tax rate jurisdictions and increased costs of remittances while the effective tax rate was reduced in 2003 through the realization of tax credits and incentives and as a result of global tax planning strategies including overseas asset revaluations 

  

the impact of the 2004 restructuring program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period will depend upon the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved since the majority of restructuring costs have been incurred in low tax jurisdictions the tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2005 and 2004 for the 2004 restructuring program was at a rate of 206 and 301 respectively over its duration charges associated with the 2004 restructuring program are projected to generate tax benefits at a rate between 25 and 30

managing foreign currency interest rate and commodity price exposure 

  

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes 

  

with operations in over 200 countries and territories the company is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in europe and certain latin american countries although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar the company monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements 

  

the company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts cross currency interest rate swaps local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business from time to time the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months 

  

interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 

  

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

  

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases in 2005 the results of the company’s commodity hedging activities were not material 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a longterm debt rating of aaaa3 or higher 

  

value at risk 

  

the company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a valueatrisk var model and an earningsatrisk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur given a 95 confidence level historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated using the var model is not material to the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company in 2005 and 2004 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated utilizing the ear model is not material to the company’s results of operations in 2005 and 2004 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs—an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4” sfas 151 sfas 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead further sfas 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to conversion costs be based on normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions in sfas 151 must be applied prospectively to the company’s inventory costs incurred on or after january 1 2006 the adoption of sfas 151 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas 123r sfas 123r replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 by eliminating the choice to account for employee stock options under accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb 25 and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options and restricted stock based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant currently under apb 25 the value of restricted stock awards is expensed by the company over the restriction period and no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants as all such grants have an exercise price not less than fair market value on the date of grant 

  

additionally certain of the company’s stock options granted to eligible participants have an accelerated vesting feature associated with employee retirement and most of the restricted stock awards specify that 

  

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

  

participants will continue to vest in the award after retirement currently the company follows the nominal vesting period approach which requires recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period except in the instance of the participants’ actual retirement upon the adoption of sfas 123r the company’s policy regarding the timing of expense recognition for new awards to employees eligible for retirement will as required be changed to recognize compensation cost over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award 

  

the company will adopt the provisions of sfas 123r effective january 1 2006 using the modified prospective method which will result in an incremental expense upon adoption the impact on earnings per share in fiscal year 2006 of these requirements is currently estimated in the range of 009 to 010 future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in the company’s assumptions or changes in market conditions due to the timing of the company’s equity grants the charge will not be spread evenly throughout the year sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required thereby potentially reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption such amounts cannot be estimated for future periods with certainty because they depend largely on when employees will exercise the stock options and the market price of the company’s stock at the time of exercise 

  

refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options shipping and handling costs and inventories 

  

   

   

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

  

   

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits asset impairment tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies 

  

   

   

   

   

   

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

  

   

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies 

  

outlook 

  

looking forward into 2006 while the company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive it believes it is well positioned for continued growth it anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share the 2004 restructuring program is designed to enhance the company’s global leadership position in its core businesses as part of the 2004 restructuring program the company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales marketing and new product organizations in highpotential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets the savings and benefits from the 2004 restructuring program along with the company’s other ongoing costsavings and growth initiatives are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability 

  

however as noted above the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation in addition changes in economic conditions movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in us dollars in particular economic and political uncertainty in some countries in latin america and changes in the value of latin american and european currencies may impact the overall results of these regions historically the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries over the long term colgate’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets and its strong capital base all position the company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value

in addition the brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the company’s brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition the tax assessments with interest at the current exchange rate and the related potential for assessments in subsequent years approximate 70 million the company is either disputing the disallowances before the brazilian internal revenue authority or in the case of those made earlier in time is appealing to the first board of taxpayers further appeals are available within the brazilian federal courts although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel and other experts that the disallowances are without merit and that the company should prevail on appeal before the first board of taxpayers or if necessary in brazilian federal court the company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously 

  

in addition brazilian prosecutors reviewed the foregoing transactions as part of an overall examination of all international transfers of reais through nonresident current accounts during the 1992 to 1998 time frame a review which the company understands involved hundreds and possibly thousands of other individuals and companies unrelated to the company at the request of these prosecutors in february 2004 a federal judge agreed to authorize criminal charges against certain current and former officers of the company’s brazilian subsidiary based on the same allegations made in the central bank and tax proceedings discussed above management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that these officers behaved in all respects properly and in accordance with law in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition management intends to support and defend these officers vigorously 

  

in 2002 the brazilian federal public attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of brazil laboratorios wyethwhitehall ltda the brazilian subsidiary of the seller and the company as represented by its brazilian subsidiary seeking to annul an april 2000 decision by the brazilian board of tax appeals that found in favor of the seller’s subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of kolynos the action seeks to make the company’s brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the seller’s subsidiary although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel that the company should ultimately prevail in this action the company intends to challenge this action vigorously

certain of the company’s financing arrangements require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to debt the esop notes guaranteed by the company and certain credit facilities contain crossdefault provisions noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote 

  

the company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill the requirements of its compensation and benefit plans in october 2004 the board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to 20 million shares of the company’s common stock through december 31 2005 the 2004 program aggregate repurchases for 2004 including repurchases under the 2004 program and other board authorizations were 124 million common shares for a total purchase price of 6379 aggregate repurchases for 2003 were 102 million common shares and 1 million shares of preferred stock for a total purchase price of 5549 in 2002 203 million shares were repurchased for a total purchase price of 11052

the company believes that internally generated cash flows are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures free cash flow before dividends was 14062 14656 and 12675 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the company defines free cash flow before dividends as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures as management uses this measure to evaluate the company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations repurchase stock pay dividends and fund future business opportunities the company believes that it provides useful information to investors free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the company has certain nondiscretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure free cash flow before dividends is not a gaap measurement

managing foreign currency interest rate and commodity price exposure 

  

the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity price fluctuations volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques including working capital management selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the company’s treasury and risk management policies the company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes 

  

with operations in over 200 countries and territories the company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the european union and certain latin american countries although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar the company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs 

  

the company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business from time to time the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months 

  

interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 

  

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

  

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases the results of the company’s commodity hedging activities are not material 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a longterm debt rating of aaaa3 or higher 

  

value at risk 

  

the company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a valueatrisk var model and an earningsatrisk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur given a 95 confidence level historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated using the var model is not material to the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company in 2004 and 2003 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated utilizing the ear model is not material to the company’s results of operations in 2004 and 2003 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

the american jobs creation act of 2004 the ajca was enacted on october 22 2004 among other provisions the ajca repeals an export incentive creates a new deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities and includes a special onetime deduction of 85 of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the us the ajca did not impact the company’s 2004 consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options shipping and handling costs and inventories

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits asset impairment tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

outlook 

  

in 2004 net sales grew 70 driven by strong volume growth of 55 despite increased competition in several of the company’s key markets these gains were driven by increased advertising and promotional support in key categories and markets in line with the company’s strategy to invest in its higher margin businesses at the same time however raw and packing material costs increased the combined increase in these costs and the higher advertising and promotional spending more than offset savings generated during the year by the company’s ongoing global costreduction programs as a result operating profit for the year declined 2 which included a 687 charge in connection with the fouryear restructuring and businessbuilding plan the company began implementing in december 2004 the 2004 restructuring program is designed to enhance the company’s global leadership position in its core businesses as part of the 2004 restructuring program the company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales marketing and new product organizations in highpotential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets 

  

looking forward into 2005 while the company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive it believes it is well positioned for continued growth it anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share the savings and benefits from the 2004 restructuring program along with the company’s other ongoing costsavings initiatives are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability 

  

however as noted above the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation in addition changes in economic conditions movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in us dollars in particular economic and political uncertainty in some countries in latin america and changes in the value of latin american and european currencies may impact the overall results of these regions historically the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries over the long term colgate’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets and its strong capital base all position the company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value

with operations in over 200 countries and territories the company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the european union and certain latin american countries although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar the company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of costcontainment measures foreign currency hedging activities and selling price increases 

  

the company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business from time to time the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months 

  

interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company’s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 

  

the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases the results of the company’s commodity hedging activities are not material 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company however nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the company’s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a longterm debt rating of a or higher 

  

value at risk 

  

the company’s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a valueatrisk var model and an earningsatrisk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur given a 95 confidence level the models utilize a variancecovariance modeling technique 

  

dollars in millions except per share amounts 

  

historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated using the var model is not material to the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company in 2002 and 2001 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated utilizing the ear model is not material to the company’s results of operations in 2002 and 2001 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options shipping and handling costs and inventories

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits asset impairment tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company’s significant accounting policies

outlook 

  

looking forward into 2003 the company is well positioned for continued growth in most of its markets however the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration in addition movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in us dollars in particular economic uncertainty in some countries in latin america and changes in the value of the euro may impact the overall results of latin america and europe 

  

the company expects the continued success of colgate toothpaste using patented and proprietary technology to bolster worldwide oral care leadership and expects new products in oral care and other categories to add potential for further growth overall subject to global economic conditions the company does not expect the 2003 market conditions to be materially different from those experienced in 2002 and the company expects its positive momentum to continue 

  

historically the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries therefore the company constantly evaluates projects that will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced growth potential over the long term colgate’s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets and its strong capital base all position the company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder value

volatility relating to these exposures on a consolidated basis by utilizing a
number of techniques including working capital management selective
borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument
transactions in accordance with the companys treasury and risk management
policies

   the company operates in over 200 countries and territories and is exposed to
currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in
currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currency exposures
involve the markets in the european union mexico and brazil although all
regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us
dollar the company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these
markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of
foreign currency rate movements through a combination of costcontainment
measures foreign currency hedging activities and selling price increases the
company primarily utilizes forward exchange and currency swap contracts to
hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and
assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business from time to
time the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases
using foreign currency forward contracts with durations no greater than 18
months

the companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a
longterm debt rating of a or higher in addition if all these counterparties
did not perform the companys risk of credit loss would not be material

value at risk

   the companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest
rate and foreign exchange exposures and the companys offsetting hedge
positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value
sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk estimations however the use of these
techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be
construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related
assumptions the company utilizes a valueatrisk var model and an
earningsatrisk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential
loss in its interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming
adverse market conditions occur given a 95 confidence level the models
utilize a variancecovariance modeling technique historical interest rates and
foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the
volatility and correlation of future rates

   the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate
or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated using the var model is not
material to the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash
flows of the company the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to
interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated utilizing the
ear model is not material to the companys results of operations actual
results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to
actual developments in the global financial markets

eitf recently reached consensus on topics relating to the classification of
various types of sales incentives and promotional expenses the company will
adopt the new accounting requirements effective january 1 2002 the impact of
the new accounting will result in the reclassification of certain sales
incentives and promotional expenses from selling general and administrative
expenses to either a reduction of net sales or an increase of cost of sales
but will have no impact on the companys financial position or net income
based on historical information annual net sales as currently reported for
2001 and 2000 will be reduced by approximately 4 with a corresponding
reduction in selling general and administrative expenses the impact on annual
cost of sales as currently reported is not material in our 2002 consolidated
financial statements all comparative periods will be reclassified to conform
to the new requirements

   in july 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
sfas no 141 business combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets in addition to requiring the use of the purchase method for
all future business combinations sfas 141 broadens the criteria for recording
intangible assets separate from goodwill sfas 142 addresses accounting and
reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets under
the new standards goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets such as the
companys global brands are no longer amortized but will be subject to annual
impairment tests finite life intangible assets such as noncompete agreements
will continue to be amortized over their useful lives

   the company will adopt these statements effective january 1 2002 as a
result the company will cease amortization of goodwill and indefinite life
intangible assets which is expected to increase income before income taxes by
approximately 500 and net income by approximately 400 annual amortization

tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets it is managements
preliminary assessment that a transitional impairment charge if any will not
be material

accounting policies and use of estimates

   the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use
judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and
assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions
are completed as such the most significant uncertainty in the companys
assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements
include pension and health care cost assumptions and legal and tax contingency
reserves actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates

   in certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united
states allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the companys
more significant policies where alternative methods are available include the
accounting for stock options refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements for further information and inventories lifofifo for more

cautionary statement on forwardlooking statements


   from time to time the company may make statements which constitute or
contain forwardlooking information as that term is defined in the private
securities litigation reform act of 1995 or by the securities and exchange
commission in its rules regulations and releases such statements may relate
for example to sales or volume growth earnings growth financial goals cost
reduction plans and new product introductions among other matters the company
cautions investors that any such forwardlooking statements made by the company
are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ
materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in the companys
forwardlooking statements the following are some of the factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements

      1 global economic conditions  the company operates on a global basis
   with approximately 70 of its net sales coming from operations outside the
   us the company is subject to the full range of economic risks including
   those associated with international operations such as economic recession
   inflation access to capital markets and related costs movements in
   currency exchange rates and interest rates trade restrictions tax law
   changes political and legal instability the imposition of trade
   restrictions and similar factors beyond the control of the company

      2 competition  the company faces vigorous competition from
   multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same
   or greater resources than the company such competition is based on pricing
   of products promotional activities advertising new product introductions
   electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors the
   timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the company the companys
   ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands its ability
   to attract and retain key talent and its ability to protect its patent
   trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges
   brought by competitors

      3 retail trade  the company can be negatively affected by changes in
   the policies of its retail trade customers such as inventory destocking
   limitations on access to shelf space electronic data transmission
   requirements and other conditions with the growing trend towards retail
   trade consolidation especially in developed markets such as the united
   states and europe the company is increasingly dependent on key retailers
   and these retailers have increasingly greater bargaining strength in
   addition private label brands sold by retail trade chains are becoming a
   source of competition for the company

      4 products  the companys growth depends on the successful development
   and introduction of new products and line extensions which face the
   uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors
   as well as the continued success of existing products in addition the
   companys ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain
   existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological
   innovations to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark
   protection and regulatory approvals and to anticipate successfully consumer
   needs and preferences

      5 cost pressures  the companys ability to manage its cost structure
   can be adversely affected by movements in raw material prices and by
   unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in
   manufacturing and distribution in addition the companys move to global
   suppliers to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business has
   resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers

      6 manufacturing  as a company engaged in manufacturing on a global
   scale the company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities
   including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other
   labor disputes loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product
   quality and safety issues natural disasters and other external factors over
   which the company has no control

2  summary of significant accounting policies

principles of consolidation

   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
colgatepalmolive company and its majorityowned subsidiaries intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated investments in companies in
which the companys interest is between 20 and 50 are accounted for using the
equity method the companys share of the net incomeloss from such
investments is recorded in other expense net in the consolidated statements
of income

use of estimates

   the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use
judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions
increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are
completed as such the most significant uncertainty in the companys
assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements
include pension and health care cost assumptions and legal and tax contingency
reserves actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates

accounting changes

   the financial accounting standards boards fasb emerging issues task force
eitf recently reached consensus on topics relating to the classification of
various types of sales incentives and promotional expenses the company will
adopt the new accounting requirements effective january 1 2002 the impact of
the new accounting will result in the reclassification of certain sales
incentives and promotional expenses from selling general and administrative
expenses to either a reduction of net sales or an increase of cost of sales
but will have no impact on the companys financial position or net income
based on historical information annual net sales as currently reported for
2001 and 2000 will be reduced by approximately 4 with a corresponding
reduction in selling general and administrative expenses the impact on annual
cost of sales as currently reported is not material in our 2002 consolidated
financial statements all comparative periods will be reclassified to conform
to the new requirements

   in july 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
sfas no 141 business combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets in addition to requiring the use of the purchase method for
all future business combinations sfas 141 broadens the criteria for recording
intangible assets separate from goodwill sfas 142 addresses accounting and
reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets under
the new standards goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets such as the
companys global brands will no longer be amortized but will be subject to
annual impairment tests finite life intangible assets such as noncompete
agreements will continue to be amortized over their useful lives

   the company will adopt these statements effective january 1 2002 as a
result the company will cease amortization of goodwill and indefinite life
intangible assets which is expected to increase income before income taxes by
approximately 500 and net income by approximately 400 annual amortization

756 for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively
during 2002 the company will perform the required transitional impairment
tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets it is managements
preliminary assessment that a transitional impairment charge if any will not
be material

cash and cash equivalents

   the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents

inventories

   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the firstin
firstout fifo method is used to determine the cost of most inventories the
cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the lastin firstout

straightline method generally over a period of 40 years other intangible
assets principally consisting of brands trademarks and noncompete
agreements are amortized on the straightline method over periods ranging from
5 to 40 years depending on their useful lives

   the recoverability of the carrying values of intangible assets is evaluated
periodically based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the
profitability of the related business for the threeyear period ended december
31 2001 there were no material adjustments to the carrying values of
intangible assets resulting from these evaluations

translation of overseas currencies

   the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries other than those operating in
highly inflationary environments are translated into us dollars at yearend
exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a
separate component of shareholders equity income and expense items are
converted into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the
year

   for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments inventories
goodwill and property plant and equipment are translated at the rate of
exchange on the date the assets were acquired while other assets and
liabilities are translated at yearend exchange rates translation adjustments

financial instruments

   effective january 1 2001 the company adopted statement of financial
accounting standards no 133 sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments
and hedging activities sfas 133 as amended establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in
the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value
the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas 133 did not result in a material
impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

   it is the companys policy to enter into derivative instruments with terms
that match the underlying exposure being hedged as such the companys
derivative instruments are considered highly effective and the net gain or loss
from hedge ineffectiveness was not material

   the companys derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are
primarily designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges for fair
value hedges changes in fair value of the derivative as well as the offsetting
changes in fair value of the hedged item are recognized in earnings each
period for cash flow hedges changes in fair value of the derivative are
recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the
offsetting effect of the hedged item is also recognized in earnings

   the company may also enter into certain foreign currency derivative
instruments that economically hedge certain of its risks but do not qualify for
hedge accounting changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are
obtained from quoted market prices and are recognized in earnings each period

   the company applies accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting
for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for
options granted under the plans accordingly no compensation expense has been
recognized had compensation expense been determined based on the blackscholes
option pricing model value at the grant date for awards in 2001 2000 and 1999
consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards
no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas 123 the companys
net income basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common
share would have been 11017 194 per share and 181 per share
respectively in 2001 10061 171 per share and 160 per share
respectively in 2000 and 8919 149 per share and 140 per share
respectively in 1999

   the weighted average blackscholes value of stock option grants issued in
2001 2000 and 1999 was 937 1095 and 861 respectively the
blackscholes value of each option granted is estimated using the blackscholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions option term until exercise
ranging from 2 to 7 years volatility ranging from 22 to 41 riskfree
interest rate ranging from 33 to 62 and an expected dividend yield of 25
the blackscholes model used to determine the option values shown above was
developed to estimate the fair value of shortterm freely tradable fully
transferable options without vesting restrictions and was not designed to value
reloads all of which significantly differ from the companys stock option
awards the value of this model is also limited by the inclusion of highly
subjective assumptions that greatly affect calculated values

   the 2001 cumulative translation adjustment charge resulted primarily from
devaluation of the brazilian real of 1050 and the argentine peso of 668 in
2000 and 1999 the cumulative translation adjustment charge related primarily
to the devaluation of the brazilian real of 451 and 2424 respectively
these charges represented writedowns of foreign currency denominated assets
primarily goodwill and property plant and equipment that will result in
lower depreciation expense in future periods

longterm debt rating of a or higher in addition if all these counterparties
did not perform the companys risk of credit loss would not be material
