pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with internallydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with speciallycoated backing papers and films they are then sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson

contact it generally consists of four layers a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive from premature contact with other surfaces that can also serve as a carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive so that the label or other face material may be pressed or rolled into place because they are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared to other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives while also offering aesthetic and other advantages over alternative technologies 

 

label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label converters for labeling decorating and specialty applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials are also used to convey variable information such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials which can be made into labels of varying sizes and shapes

human capital resources 

our global workforce 

with approximately 75 of our 2021 net sales originating outside the us and approximately half of our net sales originating in emerging markets asia pacific latin america eastern europe and middle eastnorthern africa our employees are located in over 50 countries to best serve our customers approximately 84 of our employees at yearend

2021 were located outside the us and approximately 68 were located in emerging markets 

the charts below show our global employee population by region and operational function over 21000 of our approximately 36000 employees at yearend

2021 representing approximately 58 of our global workforce were in asia pacific serving our customers in that region by function approximately 67 of our global workforce worked in the operations of our manufacturing facilities worldwide or in positions directly supporting them from other locations 

 

 

 

talent  development 

attracting developing and retaining a pool of diverse and highlyskilled talent is critical to our ability to continue achieving sustainable growth we provide ongoing support and resources to our teams worldwide to ensure that our employees’ skills evolve with our business needs industry trends and human capital management best practices and enable increased productivity peak performance and career growth we have robust talent review and succession planning processes which define and provide individually targeted development opportunities for our team members we emphasize onthejob

development and coaching and also provide facilitatorled and directaccess online

training special projects and in some cases crossfunctional or crossregional work assignments 

diversity equity  inclusion dei 

continuously advancing an inclusive culture and equitable practices that enable and empower a diverse workforce is essential to our remaining at the forefront of materials science and manufacturing in 2021 we leveraged our regional dei councils employee resource groups ergs and broader organization to better understand where we were our strengths and our opportunities and from there define where we aspired to be these efforts included both qualitative and quantitative inputs from across the enterprise including a formal inclusion assessment survey conducted by an independent third party through which we heard from approximately 15000 of our employees worldwide a threeyear rolling pipeline analysis focused globally on women and in the us also on blackafrican american asian and hispaniclatinx employees 

after a great deal of organizational exploration reflection and dialogue we crafted and deployed our goforward dei strategy in 2021 females in manager and above roles increased from 34 in 2020 to 35 in 2021 we also introduced a formal global dei infrastructure under the leadership of a global dei director this team is dedicated to helping advance our efforts around dei and guide and support the efforts of our ergs and regional dei councils 

ergs continue to be an integral part of our dei strategy ergs create opportunities for employees to learn and experience greater belonging ergs bring together employees who have shared interests and a common desire to make our company a more open and inclusive workplace ergs serve as a sounding board and valuable way for employees to collectively amplify their voices our ergs currently include 24 groups focused on driving inclusion and advancement for women employees of color lgbtq employees veterans and others 

pay  benefits 

our compensation philosophy is to offer marketbased competitive wages and benefits in all markets where we compete for talent – all of our employees were paid at least the applicable legal minimum wage and 96 of our employees were paid above the applicable legal minimum wage at yearend

2021 pay is positioned around the market median with variances based on knowledge skills years of experience and performance in addition to base wages our compensation and benefit programs — which vary by region country and business unit — include shortterm incentives longterm incentives eg cash or stockbased awards employee savings plans healthcare and insurance benefits health savings and flexible spending accounts paid time off family leave flexible work arrangements and employee assistance programs we regularly evaluate pay equity making adjustments where needed in 2020 we expanded our review to include raceethnicity in addition to gender and in 2021 increased the scope to include nonmanagerial professional employees as well as shop floor employees in the us 

workforce health  safety 

safety is one of our highest priorities and we work hard to ensure our manufacturing facilities distribution centers and administrative offices focus on safety so that anyone working in or visiting one of our locations feels and remains safe from injury our global recordable incident rate of 021 in 2021 was significantly lower than the occupational safety and health administration manufacturing industry average of 31 in 2020 the most recent available industry average 

employee engagement 

because we believe that an engaged workforce is a more innovative productive and satisfied workforce promoting retention and minimizing employee turnover we annually conduct a global employee engagement survey our business and functional teams use the results of our survey to identify and implement actions to address potential 

 

opportunities for improvement while employee engagement is the result of many factors we believe strong encouraging and open leadership as well as a continued effort to foster a collaborative supportive culture leads to strong workforce engagement we want all our employees to strive to be their best and to feel that they have the support necessary to deliver exceptional results for themselves and our company 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials – primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources – that are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available in 2021 while our supply chains were tight we worked to actively manage through a dynamic supply and demand environment in which demand across the majority of our businesses and regions was strong while raw material freight and labor availability was constrained 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt

adhesive technologies a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere or contaminate soil or groundwater emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt

adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position results of operations or competitive position

risk factors 

tableend 

the risk factors described in this section could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline this list of risks is not exhaustive our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the most significant ones described in this section 

risks related to covid19

covid19

had an adverse effect on portions of our business and we could experience further negative consequences as a result of covid19

that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our operations largely recovered in 2021 from the prioryear impact of the covid19 pandemic with higher volume across our businesses uncertainty surrounding the global health crisis remained elevated in 2021 as many parts of the world experienced an increased number of covid19 cases at some point during the year the greatest impact to our company was in southeast asia particularly in our rbis reportable segment 

we worked to actively manage through a dynamic supply and demand environment in which demand across the majority of our businesses and regions was strong while raw material freight and labor availability was constrained inflation was persistent and we implemented pricing and material reengineering actions to offset higher costs we also leveraged our global scale working closely with our customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions and demonstrating agility and preparedness through robust scenario planning 

we are unable to predict the full impact that covid19

will have on our business in 2022 due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic the impact of the spread of new and existing variants of the virus the availability adoption and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments and containment measures and the related macroeconomic impacts we continue to manage this dynamic environment and regularly update our scenario planning to reflect the continuously evolving aspects of the pandemic 

we cannot predict the impact of covid19 on our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners including our financing sources and how these impacts will affect our business 

covid19 has affected and is likely to continue affecting our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners but we are not able to predict the ultimate consequences that will result delays in production or delivery of components or raw materials in our global supply chain or the cost and ability to transport those components or materials or our finished goods due to restrictions imposed to limit the spread of covid19 have delayed and could further delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and materials to deliver finished goods to customers with these impacts and the higher cost of freight also increasing our costs while we have mitigated some of this impact by raising prices continued increases in pricing to combat inflation could result in loss of customers to other suppliers reduction of our market share and material and adverse impact to our business while supply chain constraints and raw material availability had a significant impact on our teams and industries during fiscal year 2021 they did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial results due to our implementation of mitigation strategies if conditions continue to worsen or last for an extended period of time or if inflation remains persistent our supply chains could be materially adversely affected if our sales channels were to become substantially impacted for an extended period of time our business could be materially adversely affected in the first quarter of 2020 our ability to access the commercial paper market was disrupted as a result of the pandemic and we drew down 500 million from our revolving credit facility which we repaid in the second quarter of 2020 if commercial paper markets or our ability to draw under our 800 million revolving credit facility were to become disrupted in the future due to the impact of covid19 on our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners our liquidity could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business 

the ability of our employees to work has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by covid19

our employees have been significantly impacted by covid19

our office and management personnel in certain countries have generally worked from home since march 2020 and some of our employees engaged in manufacturing production and distribution facilities have been at times restricted by governmental orders from coming to work we have experienced and may experience in the future temporary facility closures in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate the safety and wellbeing of our employees has 

 

been and continues to be our top priority we have taken steps to ensure employee safety quickly implementing worldclass safety protocols and continuing to adapt our guidelines as the pandemic continues to evolve and we may need to implement further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our workforce being exposed to covid19

including securing supplies for our facilities and providing personal protective equipment for our employees where appropriate we may take further actions required by international federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers shareholders and communities the pandemic has already constrained the labor market with certain individuals electing to leave their current positions or the workforce entirely commonly referred to as the “great resignation” and both prospective and current employees more actively seeking higher compensation and benefits in what has become known as the “war for talent” further our management team is focused on mitigating the economic effects of covid19

which required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across our entire company diverting attention from other priorities if these conditions worsen or last for an extended period of time or there is a disruption in the technology we use to operate remotely our ability to manage our business may be impaired and operational cybersecurity and other risks may be elevated 

risk related to our international operations 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic social political and market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign earnings and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products in 2021 approximately 75 of our net sales were from international operations 

macroeconomic developments such as impacts from covid19

inflation raw material freight and labor availability slower growth in the geographic regions in which we operate and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

while we saw the ease of trade tensions between the us and some of its trading partners such as the eu and japan we continue to face uncertainty from trade relations between the us and china over the past few years the us government has imposed additional tariffs on products imported into the us from china this has resulted in reciprocal tariffs on goods imported from the us into china the impacts on our operations to date have not been significant there remains risk that our business could be significantly impacted if additional tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on products any of these actions or further developments in international trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political social or economic instability and unrest – such as civil political and economic disturbances in places such as the us russia ukraine afghanistan syria iraq iran turkey north korea and hong kong and the related impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic social political or market conditions in the us or other countries 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may materially adversely affect our business 

the substantial majority of our net sales in 2021 was in foreign currencies fluctuations in currencies such as those associated with the euro and chinese yuan in 2021 which had a favorable impact for this year can be unfavorable and result in a variety of negative effects including lower net sales increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowance for credit losses andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangible assets foreign currency translation increased our net sales in 2021 by approximately 201 million margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies the effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates further hedging activities may offset only a portion or none at all of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations 

our strategy includes increased growth in emerging markets including china which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions civil unrest economic volatility contagious disease and other risks applicable to international operations 

a significant amount of our net sales – approximately half of our net sales in 2021 – originated in emerging markets including countries in asia pacific latin america and eastern europe the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our longterm growth strategy and our regional results have and can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions our business operations have been and may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in china including as a result of its response to tariffs instituted by the us government on goods imported from china tariffs imposed by china on us goods more active use of economic sanctions and export control restrictions any trade agreements entered into between the us and china and increasing tensions as a result of the two countries’ relationships with hong kong and taiwan our ability to operate in china or other emerging markets may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions or the interpretation thereof including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs raw materials environmental regulations land use rights property foreign currency conversion the regulation of private enterprises and other matters 

in early 2020 in response to the initial outbreak of covid19

many of our manufacturing and other operations in china experienced limited production andor closure as the outbreak spread beyond this region our facilities in other countries were similarly impacted most significantly in south asia in late 2020 in 2021 with the spread of the delta variant midyear we experienced intermittent closures in southeast asia particularly in our rbis reportable segment all of our manufacturing facilities are currently open but many of our employees are still unable to travel easily within and outside their countries the pandemic and any other adverse development in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business 

there have been and could be further disruptions in our supply chain or ability to manufacture our products as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers any of which could impact our sales and operating results overall covid19 had a negative impact on our consolidated financial results in 2020 most significantly in our rbis and ihm reportable segments its direct impact on our operations in 2021 was more modest the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our financial results is dependent on future developments which are uncertain and unpredictable covid19

has adversely affected the economies and financial markets in virtually all countries and further escalation of the pandemic could lead to a more significant economic downturn that could adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

if we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries our financial performance could be materially adversely affected in addition to the risks applicable to our international operations factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these emerging markets include the less established or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions civil unrest or economic volatility these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power reducing demand for our products or increasing our costs 

our operations and activities outside of the us may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations 

a substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the us and in 2021 approximately 75 of our sales was generated outside of the us international operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including nationally regionally and locally material adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies inflation reduced protection of intellectual property 

 

rights laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to sales operations taxes employment and legal proceedings establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations such as the uk’s bribery act of 2010 differences in lending practices challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations and differences in language culture and time zone 

uncertainty remains as to how the exit of the united kingdom “uk” from the european union “eu” commonly known as “brexit” will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the european union and the uk as well as whether other countries in the european union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region the postbrexit ukeu relationship is under strain with differences in terms of northern ireland and the border and immigration arrangements between the two a prolonged acrimonious process compounded by the pandemic and its economic fallout could weaken the continent as a whole as other powers notably china and russia become increasingly assertive while our operations in the uk are relatively small we have operations in many countries in the european union as a result the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any laws or regulations in the european union or the uk could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our business 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability depend upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or offset increases in raw material and labor costs raw material and freight cost increases have impacted our business and could materially adversely affect our business 

the availability of raw materials used in our businesses became constrained in 2021 which could continue to present challenges and lead to volatility impacting availability and pricing additionally energy costs increased in 2021 and can also be volatile and unpredictable shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials labor freight and energy were significant in 2021 during the year we implemented targeted price increases across our businesses and regions to address raw material and freight inflation if inflation remains persistent in 2022 we may have to implement similar pricing measures our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising our sales prices or reengineering our products 

it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers in 2021 we experienced supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters which are becoming more frequent due to the impacts from climate change or other events such as covid19 any such continued or prolonged disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are affected by changes in our markets due to competitive conditions technological developments laws and regulations and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively or respond appropriately to these changes it could reduce market demand or we could lose market share or be forced to reduce selling prices to maintain market share any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

we are at risk that existing or new competitors which include some of our customers distributors and suppliers will expand in our key market segments or develop new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or new technologies 

we also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price increases changes in our customer incentive programs or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive targets changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect demand for our products and a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are affected by changes in our markets due to environmental standards if we do not respond appropriately to these changes it could 

negatively impact 

market demand

market share and pricing

any of 

which could materially adversely affect our business

 

a substantial amount of our label materials are sold for use in plastic packaging in the food beverage and home and personal care market segments in recent years there has been an accelerated focus on sustainability and transparency in reporting with greater concern regarding climate change and singleuse plastics corporate commitments and increasing stakeholder expectations regarding the reuse and recyclability of plastic packaging and recycled content and increased regulation across multiple geographies regarding the collection recycling and use of recycled content we are at risk that changes in consumer preferences or laws and regulations related to the use of plastics could reduce demand for our products we have established strategic innovation platforms focused on material circularity and waste eliminationreduction to develop products and solutions that advance the circular economy and address the need for increased recyclability of plastic packaging in collaboration with our customers and the businesses in our supply chain these efforts may result in additional costs and there can be no assurance that they will be successful and a significant reduction in the use of plastic packaging could materially adversely affect demand for our products 

the scientific consensus is that the emission of greenhouse gases “ghg” is altering the composition of our atmosphere in ways that are adversely affecting global climate concern regarding climate change has led and is likely to continue to lead to increasing demands by legislators and regulators customers consumers investors and nongovernmental organizations for companies to reduce their ghg emissions in 2015 we set a goal to achieve at least a 3 absolute reduction in our ghg emissions yearoveryear and at least a 26 absolute reduction compared to our 2015 baseline by 2025 we have already exceeded this overall goal as part of our more ambitious 2030 sustainability goals announced in the first quarter of 2021 we are aiming to reduce our scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions by 70 compared to our 2015 baseline and work with our supply chain to reduce scope 3 ghg emissions by 30 against our 2018 baseline in each case by 2030 with an ambition to be net zero by 2050 we could face risks to our reputation investor confidence and market share if we are unable to continue reducing our ghg emissions increased raw material costs such as fuel and electricity and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer demand for our products the potential impact of climate change on our business is uncertain as it will depend on the limits imposed by and timing of new or stricter laws and regulations more stringent environmental standards and expectations and evolving customer and consumer preferences but it could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and employees 

to grow existing businesses and expand into new areas we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue doing so in 2021 we acquired vestcom an arkansasbased provider of shelfedge pricing productivity and consumer engagement solutions for retailers and consumer packaged goods companies for 147 billion as well as zippyyum a californiabased developer of software products used in the food service and food preparation industries and jdc a tennesseebased manufacturer of pressuresensitive specialty tapes for an aggregate of approximately 43 million in 2020 we completed our acquisitions of smartrac’s transponder rfid inlay division a manufacturer of rfid products for approximately 255 million acpo ltd “acpo” an ohiobased manufacturer of selfwound linerless pressuresensitive overlaminate products for approximately 88 million the success of any acquisition depends in part on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our businesses realizing these benefits depends in part on maintaining adequate focus on executing the business strategies of the combined company as well as the successful integration of assets operations functions and personnel we continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets and ensure we have a robust pipeline of potential opportunities 

various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls employees product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration activities can be uncertain while we have not experienced issues with our acquisitions to date including our recent acquisition of vestcom if management of our combined company is unable to continue minimizing the potential disruption of the combined company’s ongoing business during the integration process the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be fully realized in addition the inability to successfully manage the implementation of appropriate systems policies benefits and compliance programs for the combined company could have a material adverse effect on our business we may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and that of the acquired company may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention future acquisitions could result in increased debt dilution liabilities interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets there can be no assurance that 

 

acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability further we may not be able to identify valueaccretive acquisition targets that support our strategy of expanding our position in high value product categories or execute additional acquisitions in the future 

a significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business 

a significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business some converter customers served by our lgm reportable segment have consolidated and integrated vertically and some of our largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines this broad industry consolidation has accelerated and could continue to increase the concentration of our business with our largest customers further consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices while we have been generally successful at managing customer consolidations in the past increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

because some of our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties and their customers 

some of our products are sold not only by us but also by thirdparty distributors some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions including economic weakness market trends or industry consolidation or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business 

our reputation sales and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations in addition product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation 

there are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design these issues are often discovered before shipping causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds or loss of future sales both preshipping

and postshipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands we also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as our business environment changes we have adjusted and may need to further adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses in 2021 we expended approximately 14 million for restructuring actions significantly lower than in 2020 when we accelerated our restructuring activities in 2020 we implemented restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability with the reduction of positions and assets at numerous locations across our company which primarily included actions in lgm and rbis the actions in lgm were primarily associated with the consolidations of operations in north america and its graphics business in europe in part in response to covid19

the actions in rbis primarily related to global headcount and footprint reduction with some actions accelerated and expanded in response to covid19

in 2020 we also reduced costs across our company in response to covid19 approximately 135 million of which were temporary and largely returned in 2021 as markets recovered as we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies we may invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or could prove unprofitable we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies which involve operational complexities consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort if we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions our costs could increase our assets could be impaired and our returns on investments could be lower 

 

if we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications we could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements to current products helps determine our success many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts for which we expensed 137 million in 2021 these efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with our customers or end users these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries in lgm and ihm we focus on research projects related to rfid and external embellishments in rbis and medical technologies in ihm for which we have and license a number of patents additionally our research and development efforts include sustainable innovation and design of products that increase the use of recycled content reduce waste extend life or enable recycling research and development is complex and uncertain requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and as a result could compromise our competitive position 

misassessment of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we recently increased our pace of capital investment to support our longterm growth and margin expansion plans with 2721 million in capital expenditures including fixed assets and information technology in 2021 we may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate in recent years we expanded lgm’s manufacturing facilities located in emerging markets and a location in indiana moved our rbis vietnam business into a new expanded facility closed an lgm facility in germany and consolidated those operations with operations in luxembourg and belgium and made additional investments in capacity to support growth in our us graphics business our label and packaging materials businesses in luxembourg and ohio and in both capacity and business development globally for our intelligent labels rfid platform we also transferred ihm’s european medical capacity from belgium to ireland in addition we added capacity through our acquisitions of smartrac acpo jdc zippyyum and vestcom infrastructure investments which are longterm in nature may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures in execution and other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business 

our profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in all our businesses which have in the past included and may continue to include facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation the consolidation lgm’s operations in north america and its graphics business in europe the global headcount and footprint reduction in rbis and the temporary cost saving actions we implemented in 2020 to mitigate the impact of the downturn caused by covid19 are examples of these activities we had incremental savings from restructuring actions net of transition costs of approximately 65 million in fiscal year 2021 the success of these efforts is not assured and targeted savings may not be realized in addition cost reduction actions can result in restructuring charges and could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover

difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for credit losses is adequate we have increased our allowance when determined to be appropriate due to for example the continued impact of covid19 and related supply chain challenges issues with raw material freight and labor availability and persistent inflation and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect some of our accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments were to occur our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

risks related to income taxes 

changes in our tax rates could affect our earnings 

our effective tax rate in any period could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation there can be no assurance that any of these changes would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

potential new us tax legislation could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate 

the us government has proposed significant changes to the taxation of corporations which may include an increase in the corporate income tax rate the imposition of minimum taxes or surtaxes on certain types of income significant changes to the taxation of income derived from international business activities and the addition of further limitations on interest deductions while various proposals are under consideration it is unclear at this time what if any changes will be enacted the impact and timing of these potential changes are uncertain and may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially adversely impact our business 

corporate tax reform prevention of baseerosion and tax transparency continue to be high priorities for many tax jurisdictions worldwide as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes are under heightened scrutiny globally while tax reform legislation has been proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions 

in addition many countries have enacted or plan to enact legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation

and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” recommendations and action plans which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy with changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices moreover the oecd inclusive framework “if” on beps recently released a series of statements indicating that agreement was reached by nearly all if members on a twopillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy and providing an aggressive timeline for implementation as a result of heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities or legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change 

due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial change in international corporate tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the amount of taxes we pay and our business generally 

our inability to retain or renew certain tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate reflects benefits from concessionary tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions based on the geographic location of our manufacturing activities the industries that we serve or the business model under which we operate if we do not meet the criteria required to retain or renew these tax incentives our effective tax rate could materially increase 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

we are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes in addition tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years including continued actions by the european commission related to illegal state aid with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues requires significant judgment and is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at the time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated

accounts our 

 

results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate a significant portion of our indefinitelived net operating loss carryforwards is concentrated in luxembourg and may require decades to be fully utilized under our current business model decreases in the statutory tax rate or changes in our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in luxembourg could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

risks related to information technology 

significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of risks including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses social engineering phishing ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions for example we have invested in information technology to upgrade the systems in both our lgm north america business and rbis reportable segment to drive efficiency and supply chain productivity processes affected by these implementations included among other things order management pricing shipping purchasing supply chain and financial reporting we have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology processes including system infrastructure management application management and software as service while we have further matured our cybersecurity due diligence process in 2021 this reliance on third parties makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form which is stored in data centers and on our networks and thirdparty cloud services including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely our information technology and infrastructure may become vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions additionally we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections utilized by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised 

we perform cybersecurity due diligence and mitigate identified risks during our ma diligence process while we have a defined process which we believe has substantially mitigated the risks related to acquired companies 

 

there is still a risk that one of our recent acquisitions or a future acquisition target may experience an incident that could lead to a breach before risks are able to be mitigated 

any such breach or attack could compromise our network the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential proprietary or personal information a data center where we have stored such information or a thirdparty cloud service provider and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any access disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation impair our ability to conduct business or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property contractual provisions with third parties including cloud service providers may limit our ability to fully recover these losses if personal information of our customers or employees were to be misappropriated we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions and our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or decline in morale data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including for example the general data protection regulation in the eu the cyber security law in china the general data protection law in brazil and the state of california’s consumer privacy act of 2018 – and although we have made reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident 

although we have experienced some security incidents that did not have a significant or material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case in the future we have taken many steps to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems including conducting employee security awareness training and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data implementing multifactor authentication adopting a zero trust architecture and strategy accessing our backups for ransomware resiliency and advanced malware detection measures upgrading legacy information technology systems to simplify and standardize business processes and applications continuously improving information technology project and portfolio management discipline using metrics and reviews and implementing appropriate mitigation measures establishing a data loss prevention framework to better identify and protect our critical data conducting third party penetration testing to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity network and site access controls removing usb drive access across our company and improving our capabilities based on threat intelligence and the publicized incidents experienced by other companies as well as ones that we have experienced despite their minimal operational or financial impact to date we regularly review the effectiveness of our cybersecurity preparedness program using an industry standard cybersecurity framework and best practices eg iso27000 nist 800 despite these and other mitigation efforts cyber risk and ransomware attacks on companies continue to significantly increase and there can be no assurance that we have fully protected our information that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information in data centers and on the cloud are taking similar precautions or that we will not experience future hacking or intrusion attempts that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to human capital 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees in particular due to our expansion to additional geographies and ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees if we do not offer marketcompetitive employment and compensation terms if we fail to recruit or retain our key management or sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy further if we are unable to timely and effectively advance our dei strategy it could impact our ability to recruit and retain talent resulting in a material adverse effect on our business 

executive succession planning is also important to our longterm success we experienced several recent key management changes including promotions of longserving and experienced leaders to the positions of rbis apparel solutions vice presidentgeneral manager and ihm vice presidentgeneral manager in early 2022 and 

 

chief human resources officer and chief legal officer in 2020 while we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our key management or other highlyskilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses andor increase costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing relationships if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

we have various nonus

collective labor arrangements which make us subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our business 

work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale in addition collective bargaining agreements union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if any of our suppliers were to experience a work stoppage they could halt or limit supplies of products necessary for us to conduct our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our indebtedness 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

at january 1 2022 we had approximately 310 billion of debt our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates we pay a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited as they were in march 2020 as a result of covid19

and we were required to obtain shortterm funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2021 our average variablerate borrowings were approximately 177 million increases in shortterm interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment as of january 1 2022 the us federal reserve’s benchmark interest rate was between 0 and 025 the federal reserve has indicated that it will begin raising interest rates as early as march 2022 with additional increases possible later in the year if this occurs longterm interest rates will rise and our borrowing costs will increase such a transition may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact our stock price 

the discontinuation of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may adversely affect our borrowing costs 

as of january 1 2022 approximately 313 million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates none of which is based on libor however our revolving credit facility is based on libor in march 2021 the uk financial conduct authority announced that it will no longer require panel banks to submit quotes for 

 

libor settings other than overnight and 12month us dollar libor after december 31 2021 and will no longer require panel banks to submit quotes for any us dollar libor settings after june 30 2023 although we do not believe the risk to be significant for us the replacement rate for libor in our revolving credit facility could cause our borrowing costs to increase 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our medium and longterm notes contain and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness incur certain liens on our assets make certain investments sell our assets or merge with third parties and enter into certain transactions we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions these restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our longterm best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business 

risk related to ownership of our stock 

our stock price may be subject to significant variability 

changes in our stock price may among other things affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements and our effective tax rate our stock price which increased significantly in 2019 2020 and 2021 but declined in early 2022 is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general as seen in both 2020 and 2021 due in part to the impact of covid19

other factors including our financial performance on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and competitors as well as market expectations of our performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially adversely affect our stock price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not experience significant variability in the future 

we cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that repurchases will enhance longterm stockholder value changes in our levels of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability 

in april 2019 our board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to 650 million in addition to the amount of shares that were available for repurchase under a previous authorization as of january 1 2022 shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of 3596 million remained authorized for repurchase under this board authorization in 2021 we repurchased 9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 1809 million share repurchases under our repurchase program may be made through a variety of methods which may include open market purchases privately negotiated transactions block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions our share repurchase authorizations do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period the timing and amount of repurchases if any are subject to market and economic conditions applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors our repurchase of common stock may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice 

although we increased our quarterly dividend rate by approximately 10 in april 2021 there can be no assurance that we will maintain this increased rate future dividends are subject to market and economic conditions applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors we are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period and the payment of dividends could be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice we will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business as opportunities arise and evaluate the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results financial condition capital requirements and general business conditions the amount and timing of any future dividends may vary and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future 

in addition any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability the existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally any future 

 

repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends could impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we are currently party to a litigation in which adasa inc “adasa” an unrelated third party alleged that certain of our rfid products infringed on its patent we recorded a contingent liability related to this matter in the second quarter of 2021 in the amount of 266 million based on a jury verdict issued on may 14 2021 for more information on this litigation see note 8 “contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in our 2021 annual report if we are ultimately held liable in the adasa matter or are held liable for infringement in other matters we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure

agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure

agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

unfavorable developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters could impact us in a materially adverse manner 

there can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation investigation or other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal regulatory environmental and compliance matters see note 8 “contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in our 2021 annual report for more information 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk’s bribery act of 2010 if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers in addition if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws our business may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties 

 

we are required to comply with environmental health and safety laws at our operations around the world the costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business 

we are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste and ghg emissions from our manufacturing processes these laws impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances these laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities any failure to comply with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to fees penalties costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business laws and regulations related to the environment product content and product safety are complex change often and can be open to different interpretations in addition we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers particularly in emerging markets 

we have accrued liabilities for the environmental cleanup

of certain sites including the twelve sites for which us governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party as of our 2021 fiscal yearend

where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see note 8 “contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in our 2021 annual report for more information however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities the actual expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are subject to export and import control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets 

export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of some of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons while we train our employees to comply with these regulations use third party screening software and take other measures we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur a prohibited shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties fines civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business 

some of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception if we fail to comply with export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions or other laws we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including economic sanctions against us incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport

licenses or permits we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

risks related to other financial matters 

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets which was approximately 875 million as of january 1 2022 could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets in addition we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities which could result in charges in the nearer term as such we continuously evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolio’s overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline in september 2018 we terminated the avery dennison pension plan a us pension plan and completed the settlement of the plan’s obligations in 2019 this settlement resulted in approximately 444 million of pretax charges 

 

in 2019 partially offset by related tax benefits of approximately 179 million see note 6 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in our 2021 annual report for more information 

the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

we evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our international pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or mortality rates our pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations our pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could also be affected by future legislation or regulation 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present as of january 1 2022 the carrying value of our goodwill was 188 billion in 2021 we determined that the goodwill of our reporting units was not impaired we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made

brand pressuresensitive label and packaging materials avery dennison ®

 and mactac ®

brand graphics and avery dennison ®

brand reflective products the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products 

pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with internallydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with speciallycoated backing papers and films they are then sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson

contact it generally consists of four layers a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive from premature contact with other surfaces that can also serve as a carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive so that the label or other face material may be pressed or rolled into place because they are easy to apply without the need for adhesive 

 

activation selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared to other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives while offering aesthetic and other advantages over alternative technologies 

label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label converters for labeling decorating and specialty applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials are also used to convey variable information such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials which can be made into labels of varying sizes and shapes 

our graphics and reflective products include a variety of films and other products that are sold to the architectural commercial sign digital printing and other related market segments we also sell durable cast and reflective films to the construction automotive and fleet transportation market segments and reflective films for traffic and safety applications we provide sign shops commercial printers and designers a broad range of pressuresensitive materials that allow them to create impactful and informative brand and decorative graphics we have an array of pressuresensitive vinyl and specialty materials designed for digital imaging screen printing and sign cutting applications

patents trademarks and licenses 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery dennison our logo and fasson we believe these trademarks are strong in the market segments in which we compete 

human capital resources 

our global workforce 

with approximately 76 of our 2020 net sales originated outside the us and approximately half of our net sales originated in emerging markets asia latin america eastern europe and middle eastnorthern africa our employees are located in over 50 countries to best serve our customers approximately 87 of our employees at yearend

2020 were located outside the us and approximately 70 were located in emerging markets 

the charts below show our global employee population by region and operational function over 19000 of our approximately 32000 employees at yearend

2020 representing approximately 60 of our global workforce were in asia serving our customers in that region in addition 67 of our global workforce worked in the operations of our manufacturing facilities worldwide or in positions directly supporting them from other locations 

 

 

 

talent  development 

attracting developing and retaining a pool of diverse and highlyskilled talent is critical to our ability to continue achieving sustainable growth we provide ongoing support and resources to our teams worldwide to ensure that the skills of our employees evolve with our business needs industry trends and human capital management best practices and enable increased productivity peak performance and career growth we have robust leadership development review and succession planning processes which provide individually targeted development opportunities for our team members development which emphasizes onthejob

development and coaching also includes live and online

training special projects and in some cases crossfunctional or crossregional work assignments 

diversity  inclusion 

a diverse global workforce and an inclusive culture are essential to our remaining at the forefront of materials science and manufacturing one way we support our employees to bring their whole selves to the workplace is through our employee resource groups ergs ergs bring together employees who have shared interests and a common desire to make our company a more open and inclusive workplace our ergs currently include 13 groups focused on driving inclusion and advancement for women employees of color lgbtq employees veterans and others 

pay  benefits 

our compensation philosophy is to offer marketbased competitive wages and benefits in all markets where we compete for talent – all of our employees were paid at least the applicable legal minimum wage and 97 of our employees were paid above the applicable legal minimum wage at yearend

2020 pay is positioned around the market median with variances based on knowledge skills years of experience and performance in addition to base wages our compensation and benefit programs – which vary by region country and business unit – include shortterm incentives longterm incentives eg cash and stockbased awards employee savings plans healthcare and insurance benefits health savings and flexible spending accounts paid time off family leave flexible work arrangements and employee assistance programs we regularly evaluate pay equity expanding our review in 2020 to include raceethnicity in addition to gender and we make adjustments to compensation where needed 

workforce health  safety 

we work hard to ensure our manufacturing facilities distribution centers and administrative offices focus on safety so that anyone working in or visiting one of our locations feels and remains safe from injury in 2020 our global recordable incident rate of 021 in 2020 was significantly lower than the occupational safety and health administration manufacturing industry average of 30 in 2019 the most recent available industry average 

employee engagement 

because we believe that an engaged workforce is a more innovative productive and satisfied workforce promoting retention and minimizing employee turnover we annually conduct a global employee engagement survey our business and functional teams use the results of our survey to identify and implement actions to address noted areas of improvement while employee engagement is the result of many factors we believe strong encouraging and open leadership as well as a continued effort to foster a collaborative supportive culture leads to strong workforce engagement we want all employees to strive to be their best and to feel like they have the support necessary to deliver exceptional results for themselves and our company 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials – primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources – that are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt

adhesive technologies a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere or contaminate soil or groundwater emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these 

 

emissions in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt

adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position results of operations or competitive position

 item 1a

risk factors 

tableend 

the risk factors described in this section could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline this list of risks is not exhaustive our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the most significant ones described in this section 

risks related to covid19

covid19

has had an adverse effect on portions of our business and we could experience further negative consequences as a result of covid19

that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

overall the pandemic had a negative impact on our consolidated financial results for 2020 while we experienced sequential improvements in the second half of 2020 net sales for the full year were lower across our reportable segments due to the continued negative impact of the pandemic net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were down approximately 15 from the same period in 2019 however we experienced sequential improvement in the second half of the year resulting in our net sales for the full year being down over 1 from the prior year our label and packaging materials largely serve essential categories and experienced strong demand as a result of the pandemic given the increased consumption of packaged goods and ecommerce

trends net sales of graphics and reflective products declined due to lower demand net sales in our retail branding and information solutions “rbis” reportable segment declined significantly in the second quarter of 2020 though we experienced sequential improvement in the remainder of the year driven by net sales growth in radiofrequency identification solutions additionally net sales in our industrial and healthcare materials “ihm” reportable segment declined significantly in the second quarter mainly due to reduced industrial demand particularly in automotive end markets although we experienced sequential improvement in the remainder of the year 

we are unable to predict the full impact that covid19

will have on our 2021 results from operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and the related macroeconomic impacts we continue to manage this dynamic environment and have updated our scenario planning to reflect the continuously evolving aspects of the pandemic 

the ability of our employees to work has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by covid19

our employees have been affected by covid19

our office and management personnel in certain countries have generally worked from home since midmarch

2020 and some of our employees engaged in manufacturing production and distribution facilities were at times restricted by governmental orders from coming to work we have experienced and may experience in the future temporary facility closures in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate the safety health and wellbeing of our employees are our top priorities and we may need to implement further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our workforce being exposed to covid19

including securing supplies for our facilities and providing personal protective equipment for our employees further our management team is focused on mitigating the adverse economic effects of covid19

which required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across our entire company thereby diverting attention from other priorities that existed prior to the pandemic if these conditions worsen or last for an extended period of time or there is a disruption in the technology we use to operate remotely our ability to manage our business may be impaired and operational cybersecurity and other risks facing us prior to the pandemic may be elevated 

we cannot predict the impact of covid19

on our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners including our financing sources and how these impacts will affect our business 

covid19

has affected and is likely to continue affecting our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners but we are not able to predict the ultimate consequences that will result delays in production or delivery of components or raw materials in our global supply chain or the ability to transport those components or materials or our finished goods due to restrictions imposed to limit the spread of covid19

could delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and materials to deliver finished goods to customers while disruptions to our supply chain during fiscal year 2020 were not significant if conditions worsen or last for an extended period of time our supply chains could be materially adversely affected if our sales channels were to become substantially impacted for an extended period of time our business could be materially adversely affected in the first quarter of 2020 our ability to access the commercial paper market was disrupted and we drew down 500 million from our revolving credit facility which we repaid in the second quarter of 2020 if commercial paper markets or our ability to draw 

 

under our 800 million revolving credit facility were disrupted in the future our liquidity could be adversely affected 

risk related to our international operations 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic social political and market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign earnings and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products in 2020 approximately 76 of our net sales were from international operations 

macroeconomic developments such as impacts from covid19

slower growth in the geographic regions in which we operate the restructuring of european sovereign and other debt obligations the impact of the exit of the united kingdom “uk” from the european union commonly known as “brexit” and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we continue to face uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the us and many of its trading partners over the past few years the us government has imposed additional tariffs on products imported into the us this has resulted in reciprocal tariffs on goods imported from the us into china the european union and certain other countries the impacts on our operations to date have not been significant there remains a risk that our business could be significantly impacted if additional tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on products imported from these or other countries or if relations with these countries more broadly deteriorate these countries may continue to or other countries may begin to impose similar tariffs or restrictions on products imported from the us any of these actions or further developments in international trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political social or economic instability and unrest – such as civil political and economic disturbances in places such as the us russia ukraine syria iraq iran turkey north korea hong kong and chile and the related impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have material adverse effects on our business we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic social political or market conditions in the us or other countries 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may materially adversely affect our business 

the substantial majority of our net sales in 2020 was in foreign currencies fluctuations in currencies such as those associated with the brazilian real indian rupee mexican peso and euro in 2020 can result in a variety of negative effects including lower net sales increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for credit losses andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangible assets foreign currency translation reduced our net sales in 2020 by approximately 67 million margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies the effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates further hedging activities may offset only a portion or none at all of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations 

continued concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the eurozone could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies potentially dislocating the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces

its local currency could be significantly devalued the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing 

 

operations could substantially increase and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected furthermore if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars 

our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets including china which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions civil unrest economic volatility contagious disease and other risks applicable to international operations 

a significant amount of our net sales – approximately half of our net sales in 2020 – is originated in emerging markets including countries in asia latin america and eastern europe the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our longterm growth strategy and our regional results can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions for example while emerging markets contributed positively to our results in 2020 we believe that local economic conditions in certain countries negatively impacted our results for the year most notably in india and china largely affecting our label and graphic materials “lgm” reportable segment and industrial and automotive production in our ihm reportable segment our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in china including as a result of its response to tariffs instituted by the us government on goods imported from china any trade agreements entered into between the us and china and tensions as a result of the two countries’ relationships with hong kong and taiwan our ability to operate in china or other emerging markets may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions or the interpretation thereof including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs raw materials environmental regulations land use rights property foreign currency conversion the regulation of private enterprises and other matters 

in early 2020 in response to the initial outbreak of covid19

many of our manufacturing and other operations in china experienced limited production andor closure as the outbreak spread beyond this region our facilities in other countries were similarly impacted most significantly in south asia all of our manufacturing facilities are currently open but many of our employees are still unable to travel within and outside their countries the pandemic and any other adverse development in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business 

there could be disruptions in our supply chain or ability to manufacture our products as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers any of which could impact our sales and operating results the extent to which the pandemic will impact our financial results is dependent on future developments which are uncertain and unpredictable covid19

has adversely affected the economies and financial markets in impacted countries and further escalation of the health crisis could potentially lead to a more significant economic downturn that could adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our business covid19

adversely impacted our results for fiscal year 2020 while we took measures to mitigate this impact they were unable to fully offset it 

if we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries our financial performance could be materially adversely affected in addition to the risks applicable to our international operations factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these emerging markets include the lack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions civil unrest or economic volatility these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power reducing demand for our products or increasing our costs 

our operations and activities outside of the us may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations 

a substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the us and in 2020 the substantial majority of our sales was generated from customers located outside of the us international operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors suppliers distributors and customers in certain of these markets changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including nationally regionally and locally material adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies inflation reduced protection of intellectual property rights laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to sales operations taxes employment and legal proceedings establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations such as the uk’s bribery act of 2010 differences in 

 

lending practices challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations and differences in language culture and time zone 

there is also continued uncertainty as to how brexit will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the european union and the uk as well as whether other countries in the european union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region while our operations in the uk are relatively small the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any laws or regulations in the european union or the uk could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our business 

we are affected by changes in our markets due to competitive conditions technological developments environmental standards laws and regulations and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively or respond appropriately to these market changes it could reduce market demand or we could lose market share or be forced to reduce selling prices to maintain market share any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

we are at risk that existing or new competitors which include some of our customers distributors and suppliers will expand in our key market segments or develop new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or new technologies 

a substantial amount of our label materials are sold for use in plastic packaging in the food beverage and home and personal care market segments in recent years there has been an accelerated focus on sustainability and transparency in reporting with greater consumer concern regarding climate change and singleuse

plastics corporate commitments and increasing stakeholder expectations regarding the reuse and recyclability of plastic packaging and recycled content and increased regulation across multiple geographies regarding the collection recycling and use of recycled content we are at risk that changes in consumer preferences or laws and regulations related to the use of plastics could reduce demand for our products we have developed new products to advance the circular economy and address the need for increased recyclability of plastic packaging and are developing new solutions to address this challenge in collaboration with our customers and the businesses in our supply chain these efforts may result in additional costs and there can be no assurance that they will be successful and a significant reduction in the use of plastic packaging could materially adversely affect demand for our products 

the scientific consensus is that the emission of greenhouse gases ghg is altering the composition of our atmosphere in ways that are adversely affecting global climate concern regarding climate change has led and is likely to continue to lead to increasing demands by legislators and regulators customers shareholders and nongovernmental

organizations for companies to reduce their ghg emissions in 2015 we set a goal to achieve at least a 3 absolute reduction in our ghg emissions yearoveryear and at least a 26 absolute reduction compared to our 2015 baseline by 2025 we have already exceeded our overall 2025 goal and have set a more ambitious goal for 2030 we could face risks to our reputation investor confidence and market share if we are unable to decrease our ghg emissions increased raw material costs such as fuel and electricity and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer demand for our products the potential impact of climate change on our business is uncertain as it will depend on the limits imposed by and timing of new or stricter laws and regulations more stringent environmental standards and expectations and evolving customer preferences but it could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive targets changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect demand for our products and a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business the impact is expected to continue into 2021 but improve as economies gradually recover 

we have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and employees 

to grow existing businesses and expand into new areas we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue doing so in february 2020 we completed our acquisition of smartrac’s transponder rfid inlay division a manufacturer of rfid products for approximately 255 million and in december 2020 we completed our acquisition of acpo ltd “acpo” an ohiobased manufacturer of selfwound linerless pressuresensitive 

 

overlaminate products for approximately 88 million in recent years we completed the following acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately 340 million yongle tape ltd a chinabased manufacturer of specialty tapes and related products used in a variety of industrial markets finesse medical ltd an irelandbased manufacturer of healthcare products used in the management of wound care and skin conditions and the net assets of hanita coatings rural cooperative association limited an israelbased pressuresensitive manufacturer of specialty films and laminates and stock of certain of its subsidiaries we continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets and ensure we have a robust pipeline of opportunities 

various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls employees product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration activities are uncertain in addition we may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and that of the acquired company may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention future acquisitions could result in increased debt dilution liabilities interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets there can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability further we may not be able to identify valueaccretive acquisition targets that support our strategy of increasing our exposure to high value product categories or execute additional acquisitions in the future 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or offset increases in raw material and labor costs raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business 

the environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile impacting availability and pricing additionally energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials labor freight and energy have occurred in the past and could recur in 2018 we implemented targeted price increases in our lgm reportable segment in all regions to address raw material inflation that moderated in 2019 if we experience an inflationary trend in the future we may implement similar pricing measures our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising our selling prices or reengineering

our products 

also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers we may experience supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events such as covid19

or our existing relationships with suppliers could be terminated in the future any such disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business 

a significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business for example some converter customers served by our lgm reportable segment have consolidated and integrated vertically some of our largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines this consolidation could increase the concentration of our business with our largest customers further consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices while we generally have been successful at managing customer consolidations increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

because some of our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties and their customers 

some of our products are sold not only by us but also by thirdparty distributors some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions including economic weakness market trends or industry consolidation or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also occasionally use thirdparty manufacturers to optimize production efficiencies manage capacity overflow and produce specialty jobs most significantly in our rbis 

 

reportable segment outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and noncompliance with customer requirements while we have robust onboarding processes and continually assess the performance of these outsourced manufacturers we may experience quality issues and customer dissatisfaction that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation sales and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations in addition product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation 

there are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design these issues are often discovered before shipping causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds or loss of future sales both preshipping

and postshipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands we also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as our business environment changes including as a result of covid19

we have adjusted and may need to further adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses for example we have initiated restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability with the reduction of positions and assets at numerous locations across our company which primarily included actions in our lgm and rbis reportable segments the actions in lgm were primarily associated with the consolidations of operations in north america and its graphics business in europe in part in response to covid19

the actions in rbis primarily related to global headcount and footprint reduction with some actions accelerated and expanded in response to covid19

we have also reduced costs across our company in response to covid19

approximately 135 million of which we believe to be temporary meaning that we anticipate the majority of these costs to return as markets recover as we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies we may invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or could prove unprofitable we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies which involve operational complexities consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort if we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions our costs could increase our assets could be impaired and our returns on investments could be lower 

if we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications we could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements to current products helps determine our success many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts for which we expensed 113 million in 2020 these efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with our customers or end users these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries in our lgm and ihm segments we focus on research projects related to rfid and external embellishments in our rbis segment and medical technologies in our ihm segment for which we have and license a number of patents additionally our research and development efforts include sustainable innovation and design of products that increase the use of recycled content reduce waste extend life or enable recycling research and development is complex and uncertain requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and as a result could compromise our competitive position 

 

misassessment of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we recently increased our pace of capital investment to support our longterm growth and margin expansion plans we may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate in recent years we expanded lgm’s manufacturing facilities located in emerging markets and a location in indiana moved our rbis vietnam business into a new expanded facility closed an lgm facility in germany and consolidated those operations with operations in luxembourg and belgium and made additional investments in capacity to support growth in our us graphics business our label and packaging materials businesses in luxembourg and ohio and in both capacity and business development globally for our intelligent labels rfid platform we also transferred our ihm’s european medical capacity from belgium to ireland in addition we added capacity through our acquisitions of yongle tapes hanita coatings finesse medical smartrac and acpo infrastructure investments which are longterm in nature may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures in execution and other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business 

our profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we engage in restructuring actions including as a result of covid19

intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in all our businesses which have in the past included and may continue to include facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation the consolidation of lgm’s graphics business in europe and global headcount and footprint reduction in rbis are examples of these activities we had incremental savings from restructuring actions net of transition costs of 65 million in fiscal year 2020 the success of these efforts is not assured and targeted savings may not be realized in addition cost reduction actions can result in restructuring charges and could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover

in addition net temporary cost savings of approximately 135 million partially offset the negative impact of covid19

on volume in 2020 cost saving actions included deferrals of planned compensation increases hiring freezes overtime and temporary labor reductions shift reductions and furloughs temporary production shutdowns and travel and other discretionary spending reductions in addition we benefitted from lower incentive compensation costs in 2020 as a result of the impact of covid19

on our business these actions partially offset the negative impact on our business resulting from covid19

but were not sufficient to fully offset it some of these temporary cost reductions are expected to return in 2021 which would increase our costs in connection with growth or other changes in our business 

difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for credit losses is adequate we have experienced losses – including an approximately 65 increase in our allowance for credit losses from approximately 27 million to approximately 45 million in the 2020 as a result of covid19

– and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect some of our accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments were to occur our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to income taxes 

changes in our tax rates could affect our earnings 

our effective tax rate in any period can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation there can be no assurance that any of these changes would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

potential tax liabilities related to future changes in us tax legislation could materially impact our business 

our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities may be materially adversely affected if us tax rules change for example the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” enacted in december 2017 remains subject to further amendments interpretations and regulations any of which could impact our effective tax rate 

 

moreover the two legislative chambers of congress and the presidency are now controlled by the same political party enabling a path to potentially raise tax revenue from an increase in corporate tax rates through new tax legislation the impact and timing of such potential changes are uncertain and may materially impact our effective tax rate 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially and adversely impact our business 

corporate tax reform prevention of baseerosion and tax transparency continue to be high priorities of many tax jurisdictions worldwide as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes are under heightened scrutiny globally while tax reform legislation has been proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions 

in addition many countries have enacted or plan to enact legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation

and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” recommendations and action plans which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy with changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices moreover the oecd inclusive framework on beps has released a series of documents that addresses the tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy as a result of heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities or legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes in policies or rulings may result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change 

due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial change in international corporate tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our business generally 

our inability to retain or renew certain tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our business 

our effective tax rate reflects benefits from concessionary tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions based on the geographic location of our manufacturing activities the industries that we serve or the business model under which we operate if we do not meet the criteria required to retain or renew these tax incentives our effective tax rate could materially increase 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

we are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes in addition tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years including continued actions by the european commission related to illegal state aid with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues requires significant judgment and is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at the time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated

accounts our results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition changes in statutory tax rates or carryforward periods allowed may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate a significant portion of our indefinitelived net operating loss carryforwards is concentrated in luxembourg and may require decades to be fully utilized under our current business model decreases in the statutory tax rate or changes in our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in luxembourg could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

 

risks related to information technology 

significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of risks including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses social engineering phishing ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions for example we have invested in information technology to upgrade the systems in both our lgm north america business and rbis reportable segment to drive efficiency and supply chain productivity processes affected by these implementations included among other things order management pricing shipping purchasing supply chain and financial reporting in 2020 we made structural changes to our it organization to drive efficiencies implement new ways of working and improve our agility among other things we have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology processes – including system infrastructure management application management and software as service – which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form which is stored in data centers and on our networks and thirdparty cloud services including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely our information technology and infrastructure may become vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions additionally we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections utilized by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised 

any such breach or attack could compromise our network the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential proprietary or personal information a data center where we have stored such information or a thirdparty cloud service provider and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation impair our ability to conduct business or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property contractual provisions with third parties including cloud service providers may limit our ability to recover these losses if personal information of our customers or employees were to be misappropriated we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions and our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or decline in morale data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including for example the general data protection regulation in the eu the cyber security law in china the general data protection law in brazil and the state of california’s consumer privacy act of 2018 – and although we have made reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident 

although we have experienced some security incidents that did not have a significant or material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case in the future we have taken many steps to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems including conducting employee security awareness training and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data implementing multi

 

factor authentication and advanced malware detection measures upgrading legacy information technology systems to simplify and standardize business processes and applications continuously improving information technology project and portfolio management discipline using metrics and reviews and implementing appropriate mitigation measures establishing a data loss prevention framework to better identify and protect our critical data conducting third party penetration testing to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity network and site access controls removing usb drive access across our company and improving our capabilities based on threat intelligence and the publicized incidents experienced by other companies as well as ones that we have experienced despite their minimal operational or financial impact to date we regularly review the effectiveness of our cybersecurity preparedness program using an industry standard cybersecurity framework and best practices eg iso27000 nist 800 despite these and other mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we have fully protected our information that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information in data centers and on the cloud are taking similar precautions or that we will not experience future hacking or intrusion attempts 

risks related to human capital 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees in particular due to our expansion to additional geographies and ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees if we do not offer marketcompetitive employment and compensation terms if we fail to recruit or retain our key management or sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy 

executive succession planning is also important to our longterm success we experienced several recent key management changes including promotions of longserving and experienced leaders to the positions of chief human resources officer and chief legal officer in 2020 in addition the president of our lgm reportable segment ceased serving in that capacity at the end of 2019 while we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our key management or other highlyskilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses andor increase costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing relationships if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

we have various nonus

collective labor arrangements which make us subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our business 

work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale in addition collective bargaining agreements union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if any of our suppliers were to experience a work stoppage they could halt or limit supplies of products necessary for us to conduct our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our indebtedness 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

at january 2 2021 we had approximately 212 billion of debt our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs the credit 

 

ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited as they were in march 2020 as a result of covid19

and we were required to obtain shortterm funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2020 our average variablerate borrowings were approximately 338 million increases in shortterm interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment over the past few years the us federal reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate though more recently it lowered its benchmark interest rate which as of january 2 2021 was between 0 and 025 it is possible that increases could occur in the future which may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact our stock price 

the alteration or discontinuation of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may adversely affect our borrowing costs 

as of january 2 2021 approximately 59 million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates none of which is based on libor however our revolving credit facility is based on libor in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 as a result the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 although we do not believe the risk to be significant for us if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form our borrowing costs could increase 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our medium and longterm notes contain and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness incur certain liens on our assets make certain investments sell our assets or merge with third parties and enter into certain transactions we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions these restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our longterm best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business 

risk related to ownership of our stock 

our stock price may be subject to significant variability 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which increased significantly in 2019 and 2020 after having experienced a decline in 2018 is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general as seen in 2020 due in part to the impact of covid19

other factors including our financial performance on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and competitors as well as market expectations of our performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially adversely affect our stock price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not experience significant variability in the future 

in any period in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the stockbased compensation vesting or being exercised in that period we are required to recognize excess tax benefits that would decrease our effective tax rate conversely if our stock price is lower than the grant price of the stockbased compensation vesting or being exercised in that period we are required to recognize tax charges that would increase our effective tax rate this tax effect is dependent on our stock price and there can be no assurance that we will recognize similar levels of excess tax benefits in future years 

 

we cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that repurchases will enhance longterm stockholder value changes in our levels of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability 

in april 2019 our board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to 650 million in addition to the amount of shares that were available for repurchase under a previous authorization as of january 2 2021 shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of 5404 million remained authorized for repurchase under this board authorization in march 2020 we paused our share repurchase activity in response to covid19

after buying approximately 45 million of our stock in the quarter we resumed repurchases late in the third quarter of 2020 resulting in the repurchase of shares in the aggregate amount of 1043 million in fiscal year 2020 share repurchases under our repurchase program may be made through a variety of methods which may include open market purchases privately negotiated transactions block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions our share repurchase authorizations do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period the timing and amount of repurchases if any are subject to market and economic conditions applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors our repurchase of common stock may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice 

although we increased our quarterly dividend rate by approximately 7 in october 2020 having earlier in the year maintained it due to the impact of covid19

there can be no assurance that we will maintain this increased rate additionally any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time are subject to market and economic conditions applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors we are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period and the payment of dividends could be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice we will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business as opportunities arise and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results financial condition capital requirements and general business conditions the amount and timing of any future dividends may vary and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future 

in addition any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability the existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends could impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce our program’s effectiveness 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we were held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure

agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure

agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain 

 

competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

unfavorable developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters could impact us in a materially adverse manner 

there can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation investigation or other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters see note 8 “contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in our 2020 annual report for more information 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk’s bribery act of 2010 if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including regulatory fines monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers in addition if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws our business may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties 

we are required to comply with environmental health and safety laws at our operations around the world the costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business 

we are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us and abroad including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste and the emission of greenhouse gases from our manufacturing processes these laws impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances these laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities any failure to comply with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to fees penalties costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business laws and regulations related to the environment product content and product safety are complex change often and can be open to different interpretations in addition we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers particularly in emerging markets 

we have accrued liabilities for the environmental cleanup

of certain sites including the twelve sites for which us governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party as of our 2020 fiscal yearend

where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see note 8 “contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in our 2020 annual report for more information however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities the actual expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are subject to export and import control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets 

export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of some of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons while we train our employees to comply with these regulations use third party screening software and take other measures we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur a prohibited shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties fines civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to export or sell our products 

 

internationally any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business 

some of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception if we fail to comply with export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions or other laws we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including economic sanctions against us incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport

licenses or permits we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

risks related to other financial matters 

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets in addition we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities which could result in charges in the nearer term as such we continuously evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolio’s overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline in september 2018 we terminated the avery dennison pension plan a us pension plan and completed the settlement of the plan’s obligations in 2019 this settlement in 2019 resulted in approximately 444 million of pretax charges in 2019 partially offset by related tax benefits of approximately 179 million see note 6 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in our 2020 annual report for more information 

the level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

we evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our international pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or mortality rates our pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations our pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could also be affected by future legislation or regulation 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present as of january 2 2021 the carrying value of our goodwill was 114 billion in 2020 we determined that the goodwill of our reporting units was not impaired we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made

business overview and reportable segments

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products we sell most of our pressuresensitive materials to label printers and converters that convert the materials into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting we sell other pressuresensitive materials in converted form as tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of other converted products and items not involving pressuresensitive components such as fasteners tickets tags radiofrequency identification “rfid” inlays and tags and imprinting equipment and related solutions which serve the apparel and other end markets

our reportable segments for fiscal year 2019 were

 

in 2019 the lgm rbis and ihm segments made up approximately 67 23 and 10 respectively of our total sales

in 2019 international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business representing approximately 77 of our sales as of december 28 2019 we operated approximately 180 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide with more than 30000 employees in over 50 countries

lgm segment

our lgm segment manufactures and sells fasson® jac® and avery dennison®brand pressuresensitive label and packaging materials avery dennison® and mactac®brand graphics and avery dennison®brand reflective products the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products

pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with internallydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with speciallycoated backing papers and films they are then sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four layers a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive from premature contact with other surfaces that can also serve as a carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive so that the label or other face material may be pressed or rolled into place because they are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared to other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives while offering aesthetic and other advantages over alternative technologies

label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label converters for labeling decorating and specialty applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials are also used to convey variable information such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials which can be made into labels of varying sizes and shapes

our graphics and reflective products include a variety of films and other products that are sold to the architectural commercial sign digital printing and other related market segments we also sell durable cast and reflective films to the construction automotive and fleet transportation market segments and reflective films for traffic and safety applications we provide sign shops commercial printers and designers a broad range of pressuresensitive materials to enable the creation of impactful and informative brand and decorative graphics we have an array of pressuresensitive vinyl and specialty materials designed for digital imaging screen printing and sign cutting applications

in the lgm segment our larger competitors in label and packaging materials include upm raflatac a subsidiary of upm corporation lintec corporation ritrama spa a subsidiary of the fedrigoni group flexcon corporation inc and various regional firms for graphics and reflective products our largest competitors are 3m company “3m” and the orafol group we believe that entry of competitors into the field of pressuresensitive adhesives and materials is limited by technical knowledge and capital requirements we believe that our technical expertise size and scale of operations broad line of quality products and service programs distribution capabilities brand strength and product innovation are the primary advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position

rbis segment

our rbis segment designs manufactures and sells a wide variety of branding and information solutions to retailers brand owners apparel manufacturers distributors and industrial customers this segment experiences some seasonality with higher volume generally in advance of the spring fall backtoschool and holiday shipping periods in recent years as the apparel industry has moved to more frequent seasonal updates this segment has experienced less seasonality

the branding solutions of rbis include creative services brand embellishments graphic tickets tags and labels and sustainable packaging rbis’ information solutions include itemlevel rfid solutions visibility and loss prevention solutions price ticketing and marking care content and country of origin compliance solutions and brand protection and security solutions

in the rbis segment our primary competitors include checkpoint systems inc a subsidiary of ccl industries inc rpac international corporation and sml group limited we believe that our global distribution network reliable service product quality and consistency and ability to serve customers consistently with comprehensive solutions close to where they manufacture are the key advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position

ihm segment

our ihm segment manufactures and sells fasson®brand and avery dennison®brand tapes and other pressuresensitive adhesivebased materials and converted products mechanical fasteners and performance polymers our pressuresensitive adhesivebased materials are available in roll form and in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties these materials and converted products are used in nonmechanical fastening bonding and sealing systems for various automotive electronics building and construction general industrial personal care and medical applications ihm also manufactures and sells yongle® brand tapes for wire harnessing and cable wrapping in automotive electrical and general industrial applications the mechanical fasteners are primarily precisionextruded and injectionmolded plastic devices used in various automotive general industrial and retail applications

for industrial and healthcare materials and converted products our primary competitors include 3m tesase a subsidiary of beiersdorf ag nitto denko corporation and numerous regional and specialty suppliers for fastener products there are a variety of competitors supplying extruded and injection molded fasteners and fastener attaching equipment we believe that entry of competitors is limited by technical knowledge and capital requirements and that our technical expertise size and scale of operations broad line of highquality costeffective solutions and product innovation are the most significant advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position in this business 

research and development

many of our products are the result of our research and development efforts these efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving productivity sustainability and product performance often in close association with our customers these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries in our lgm and ihm segments additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid and external embellishments in our rbis segment and medical technologies in our ihm segment for which we hold and license a number of patents

patents trademarks and licenses

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery dennison our logo and fasson we believe these trademarks are strong in the market segments in which we compete

manufacturing and environmental matters

we use various raw materials – primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources – that are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere or contaminate soil or groundwater emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors

the risk factors described in this section as well as the matters generally described in this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated herein by reference could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline this list of risks is not exhaustive our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the most significant ones described in this section

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political and market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business

in 2019 approximately 77 of our sales were from international operations we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign earnings and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products

macroeconomic developments such as slower growth in the geographic regions in which we operate the restructuring of european sovereign and other debt obligations the impact of the united kingdom’s “uk’s” exit from the european union on january 31 2020 commonly known as “brexit” and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations in currencies such as those associated with the euro chinese yuan renminbi and brazilian real in 2019 can result in a variety of negative effects including lower revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles

we continue to face uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the us and many of its trading partners over the past few years the us government has imposed additional tariffs on products imported into the us this has resulted in reciprocal tariffs on goods imported from the us into china the european union mexico canada and certain other countries the impacts on our operations to date have been insignificant although there was some volatility in the timing of purchases by the retailers served by our rbis segment in light of traderelated uncertainty during 2019 there remains a significant risk that additional tariffs or other restrictions could be imposed on products imported from these or other countries or that relations with these countries could more broadly deteriorate these countries may continue to retaliate by imposing similar tariffs or restrictions on products imported from the us any of these actions or further developments in international trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business

in addition business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political social or economic instability and unrest – such as civil political and economic disturbances in places such as russia ukraine syria iraq iran turkey north korea hong kong and chile and the related impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have material adverse effects on our business we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic political or market conditions in the us or other countries 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may materially adversely affect our business

the substantial majority of our sales in 2019 was in foreign currencies we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies such as the euro and the chinese yuan renminbi which can cause transaction translation and other losses and could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies the effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates further hedging activities may offset only a portion or none at all of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations

continued concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the eurozone could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies potentially dislocating the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces its local currency could be significantly devalued the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing operations could substantially increase and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected furthermore if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars

we are affected by changes in our markets due to competitive conditions technological developments laws and regulations and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively or respond appropriately to these market changes it could reduce market demand or we could lose market share or be forced to reduce selling prices to maintain market share any of which could materially adversely affect our business 

we are at risk that existing or new competitors which include some of our customers distributors and suppliers will expand in our key market segments or develop new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or new technologies 

a substantial amount of our label materials are sold for use in plastic packaging in the food beverage and home and personal care market segments in recent years there has been an accelerated focus on sustainability and transparency in reporting with greater consumer concern regarding climate change and singleuse plastics corporate commitments regarding the reuse and recyclability of plastic packaging and recycled content and increased regulation across multiple geographies regarding the collection recycling and use of recycled content we are at risk that changes in consumer preferences or laws and regulations related to the use of plastics could reduce demand for our products we have developed new products to advance the circular economy and address the need for increased recyclability of plastic packaging and are developing new solutions to address this challenge in collaboration with our customers and the businesses in our supply chain these efforts may result in additional costs and there can be no assurance that they will be successful and a significant reduction in the use of plastic packaging could materially adversely affect demand for our products 

we also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive targets changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect demand for our products and a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business for example in 2019 sales growth in our lgm segment was relatively low in north america and europe due in part to share losses related to pricing actions we took in late 2018 and early 2019 to offset higher raw material costs 

our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets including china which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions civil unrest economic volatility contagious disease and other risks applicable to international operations

a significant amount of our sales is derived from emerging markets including countries in asia latin america and eastern europe the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our longterm growth strategy and our regional results can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions for example while china and other emerging markets continued to contribute positively to our results in 2019 we believe that local economic conditions negatively impacted our results in china for the year most notably in our ihm segment with the decline in automotive production our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in china including as a result of its response to tariffs instituted by the us government on goods imported from china and any potential trade agreement entered into between the us and china our ability to operate in china or other emerging markets may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions or the interpretation thereof including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs raw materials environmental regulations land use rights property foreign currency conversion the regulation of private enterprises and other matters

in addition a novel strain of coronavirus emerged in december 2019 beginning in wuhan hubei province china and in january 2020 the world health organization declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern as a result many of our manufacturing and other operations in china experienced limited production andor closure in early 2020 in addition many of our employees in the region have been unable to travel within and outside of the region this outbreak of contagious disease as well as any other adverse public health developments – particularly in asia where approximately 60 of our employees are located and a significant portion of our sales are generated – could have a material adverse effect on our business as our sales to customers in china including hong kong were approximately 20 of our net sales in 2019 

there could be further restrictions on our ability to travel or disruptions in our supply chain or ability to manufacture our products as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers any of which could impact our sales and operating results although the outbreak originated in china cases have been confirmed in other countries as well the extent to which the novel coronavirus will impact our results is dependent on future developments which are uncertain and unpredictable any widespread health crisis could adversely affect the economies and financial markets in impacted countries potentially leading to an economic downturn that could adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our business we expect that the coronavirus will adversely impact our first quarter and full year 2020 results while we will take measures to try to mitigate this impact there can be no assurance that these actions will be able to partially or fully offset the impact

if we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries our financial performance could be materially adversely affected in addition to the risks applicable to our international operations factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these emerging markets include the lack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions civil unrest or economic volatility these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power reducing demand for our products or increasing our costs

our operations and activities outside of the us may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations  

a substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the us and in 2019 the substantial majority of our sales was generated from customers located outside of the us international operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors suppliers distributors and customers in certain of these markets changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including nationally regionally and locally material adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies inflation reduced protection of intellectual property rights laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to sales operations taxes employment and legal proceedings establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations such as the uk’s bribery act of 2010 differences in lending practices challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations and differences in languages cultures and time zones 

there is also continued uncertainty as to how brexit will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the european union and the uk as well as whether other countries in the european union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region while our operations in the uk are relatively small the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any laws or regulations in the european union or the uk could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business

we have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and employees

to grow existing businesses and expand into new areas we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue doing so in recent years we completed the acquisition of the european business of mactac a leading manufacturer of highquality pressuresensitive materials serving several graphics specialty labels and industrial tapes segments for 220 million we also completed the following acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately 340 million yongle tape ltd a chinabased manufacturer of specialty tapes and related products used in a variety of industrial markets finesse medical ltd an irelandbased manufacturer of healthcare products used in the management of wound care and skin conditions and the net assets of hanita coatings rural cooperative association limited an israelbased pressuresensitive manufacturer of specialty films and laminates and stock of certain of its subsidiaries although we did not make any acquisitions in 2019 in november 2019 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire smartrac’s transponder rfid inlay division for approximately 250 million €225 million subject to certain closing and postclosing adjustments we expect that acquisition to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 in addition we continued to evaluate potential targets and ensure we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities 

various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls employees product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain in addition we may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and that of the acquired company may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention future acquisitions could result in debt dilution liabilities increased interest expense restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets there can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability further we may not be able to identify valueaccretive targets that support our strategy of increasing our exposure to high value product categories or execute additional acquisitions in the future

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or offset increases in raw material and labor costs raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business 

the environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile impacting availability and pricing additionally energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and could recur in 2018 we implemented targeted price increases in our lgm segment in all regions to address raw material inflation that moderated in 2019 our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising our selling prices and reengineering our products 

also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers we may experience supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events or our existing relationships with suppliers could be terminated in the future any such disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business

a significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business for example some converter customers served by our lgm segment have consolidated and integrated vertically some of our largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines this consolidation could increase the concentration of our business with our largest customers further consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices while we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business

because some of our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties and their customers 

some of our products are sold not only by us but also by thirdparty distributors some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions including economic weakness market trends or industry consolidation or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also occasionally use thirdparty manufacturers to optimize production efficiencies manage capacity overflow and produce specialty jobs particularly in our rbis segment outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and noncompliance with customer requirements while we have stringent onboarding processes and continuous performance assessments for these outsourced manufacturers we may experience quality issues and customer dissatisfaction that could have a material adverse effect on our business

our reputation sales and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations in addition product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation

there are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design these issues are often discovered before shipping causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds or loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could 

harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands we also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses

as our business environment changes we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses we undertook a multiyear transformation of our rbis segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our gotomarket strategy optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint in addition we have initiated restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability such as the restructuring of the european footprint of our lgm business which began in 2018 and continued in 2019 and actions taken in our ihm segment in 2019 to improve speed reduce complexity and lower costs as we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies we may invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or could prove unprofitable we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies which involve operational complexities consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort if we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions our costs could increase our assets could be impaired and our returns on investments could be lower

if we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications we could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements to current products helps determine our success many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with our customers or end users these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries in our lgm and ihm segments additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid and external embellishments in our rbis segment and medical technologies in our ihm segment for which we hold and license a number of patents however research and development is complex and uncertain requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and as a result could compromise our competitive position 

misassessment of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we recently increased our pace of capital investment to support our longterm growth and margin expansion plans we may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate in recent years we expanded lgm’s manufacturing facilities located in emerging markets and a location in indiana moved our rbis vietnam business into a new expanded facility closed a lgm facility in germany and consolidated those operations with operations in luxembourg and belgium and made additional investments in capacity to support growth in our us graphics business our label and packaging materials businesses in luxembourg and ohio and in both capacity and business development globally for our intelligent labels rfid platform we also are in the process of transferring our european ihm medical capacity from belgium to ireland in addition we added capacity through our recent acquisitions of mactac europe yongle tapes hanita coatings and finesse medical infrastructure investments which are longterm in nature may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures in execution and other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business

our profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments for example we undertook a multiyear transformation of our rbis segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our gotomarket strategy optimize 

management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in all our businesses which have in the past included and may continue to include facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation the restructuring of the european footprint of our lgm business which began in 2018 and continued in 2019 and actions taken in our ihm segment to improve speed reduce complexity and lower costs are examples of these activities the success of these efforts is not assured and targeted savings may not be realized in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover 

difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect some of our accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments were to occur our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business

changes in our tax rates could affect our earnings 

our effective tax rate in any period could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation including among others the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” enacted in december 2017 the provisions of the tcja are subject to further amendments interpretations and regulations as well as the outcome of pending or future litigation any of which could impact our tax rate there can be no assurance that any such changes would not have a material adverse effect on our business

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially and adversely impact our business 

corporate tax reform prevention of baseerosion and tax transparency continue to be high priorities of many tax jurisdictions worldwide as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes are under heightened scrutiny globally while tax reform legislation has been proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions 

in addition many countries have enacted or plan to enact legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plans which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy with changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices the oecd and the european commission continue to issue proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax liabilities are determined as a result of heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities or legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change

due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial change in international corporate tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our business generally

our inability to retain or renew certain tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our business 

our effective tax rate has reflected benefits from concessionary tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions based on the geographic location of our manufacturing activities or the industry that they serve if we do not meet the criteria required to retain or renew these tax incentives our effective tax rate could increase additionally in 2019 

we completed the application for an intellectual propertybased tax incentive in response to a historical tax incentive that was phased out due to a change in foreign tax law our provision for income taxes in 2019 reflected the related tax benefit of this incentive based on our best estimate while our request for a tax ruling from the foreign tax authority is pending we continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our future tax benefits 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

we are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes in addition tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years including continued actions by the european commission related to illegal state aid with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues requires significant judgment and is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at the time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate a significant portion of our indefinitelived net operating loss carryforwards is concentrated in luxembourg and may require decades to be fully utilized under our current business model decreases in the statutory tax rate or changes in our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in luxembourg could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations

significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of risks including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses social engineering phishing ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions for example we have invested in information technology to upgrade the systems in both our lgm north america business and rbis segment to drive business efficiency and supply chain productivity processes affected by these implementations included among other things order management pricing shipping purchasing general accounting and planning we have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology processes which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls

security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer  

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form which is stored in data centers and on our networks and thirdparty cloud services including confidential and proprietary information as well as 

personal information regarding our customers and employees the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely our information technology and infrastructure may become vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions additionally we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised 

any such breach or attack could compromise our network the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential proprietary or personal information a data center where we have stored such information or a thirdparty cloud service provider and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation impair our ability to conduct business or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property contractual provisions with third parties including cloud service providers may limit our ability to recover these losses if personal information of our customers or employees were to be misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or decline in morale and we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including for example the general data protection regulation in the eu the cyber security law in china the general data protection law in brazil and the state of california’s consumer privacy act of 2018 – and although we have made reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident

although we have experienced some security incidents that did not have a significant or material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case in the future we have taken many steps to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems including conducting user education and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data implementing multifactor authentication and advanced malware detection measures upgrading legacy information technology systems to simplify and standardize business processes and applications continuously improving information technology project and portfolio management discipline using metrics and reviews and implementing appropriate mitigation measures establishing a data loss prevention framework to better identify and protect our critical data conducting third party penetration testing to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity network and site access controls removing usb drive access across our company and improving our capabilities based on threat intelligence and the publicized incidents experienced by other companies as well as ones that we have experienced despite their minimal operational or financial impact to date we regularly review the effectiveness of our cybersecurity preparedness program using an industry standard cybersecurity framework and best practices eg iso27000 nist 800 despite these and other mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we have fully protected our information that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information in data centers and on the cloud are taking similar precautions or that we will not experience future hacking or intrusion attempts

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business

there is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees in particular due to expansion to additional geographies and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees if we do not offer marketcompetitive employment and compensation terms if we fail to recruit or retain our key management or 

sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy

executive succession planning is also important to our longterm success we experienced several recent key management changes including promotions of longserving and experienced leaders to the positions of chief executive officer in 2016 and chief financial officer in 2017 as well as the departure of the vice presidentgeneral manager of our ihm segment in 2018 in addition the president of our lgm segment ceased serving in that capacity at the end of 2019 while we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our key management or other highlyskilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses andor increase costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing relationships if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

we have various nonus collective labor arrangements which make us subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our business

work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale in addition collective bargaining agreements union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if any of our suppliers were to experience a work stoppage they could halt or limit supplies of products necessary for us to conduct our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business

our stock price may be volatile which among other things could cause our tax rate to vary significantly 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which increased significantly in 2019 after having experienced a decline in 2018 and may in the future experience substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and competitors as well as market expectations of our performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially adversely affect our stock price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not be volatile in the future 

in any period in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the stockbased compensation vesting or being exercised in that period we are required to recognize excess tax benefits that would decrease our effective tax rate conversely if our stock price is lower than the grant price of the stockbased compensation vesting or being exercised in that period we are required to recognize tax charges that would increase our effective tax rate this tax effect is dependent on our stock price and there can be no assurance that we will recognize similar levels of excess tax benefits in future years

we cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that repurchases will enhance longterm stockholder value changes in our levels of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price and increase its volatility

in april 2019 our board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to 650 million in addition to the amount of shares that were available for repurchase under a previous authorization as of december 28 2019 shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of 6447 million remained authorized for repurchase under our outstanding board authorization share repurchases under our 

repurchase program may be made through a variety of methods which may include open market purchases privately negotiated transactions block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions our share repurchase authorizations do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period the timing and amount of repurchases if any are subject to market and economic conditions applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors our repurchase of common stock may be limited suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice

additionally any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time are subject to market and economic conditions applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors we are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period and the payment of dividends could be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice we will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business as opportunities arise and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results financial condition capital requirements and general business conditions the amount and timing of any future dividends may vary and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future

in addition any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends could affect our stock price and increase its volatility the existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock additionally any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends could impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm stockholder value there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce our program’s effectiveness

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

at december 28 2019 we had approximately 194 billion of debt our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited and we were required to obtain shortterm funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business

in 2019 our average variablerate borrowings were approximately 325 million increases in shortterm interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business

in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment over the past few years the us federal reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate though more recently it lowered its benchmark interest rate which as of december 28 2019 was between 15 and 175 it is possible that increases in 2020 could occur which may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact our stock price

the alteration or discontinuation of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may adversely affect our borrowing costs

as of december 28 2019 171 million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates none of which is based on libor however our longterm credit facility is based on libor libor may be subject 

to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate or the establishment of alternative reference rates will have on our business although we do not believe the risk to be significant for us if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form our borrowing costs could be adversely affected 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness incur certain liens on our assets make certain investments sell our assets or merge with third parties and enter into certain transactions we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions these restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our longterm best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets in addition we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities which could result in charges in the nearer term as such we continuously evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolio’s overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline in september 2018 we terminated our avery dennison pension plan the “adpp” a us pension plan and completed the settlement of the adpp obligations in 2019 this settlement in 2019 resulted in approximately 444 million of pretax charges in 2019 partially offset by related tax benefits of approximately 179 million see note 6 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in our 2019 annual report

the level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements

we evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our international pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or mortality rates our pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations our pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could also be affected by future legislation or regulation 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present as of december 28 2019 the carrying value of our goodwill was 9308 million we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and 

discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made 

unfavorable developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters could impact us in a materially adverse manner 

there can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation investigation or other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk’s bribery act of 2010 if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including regulatory fines monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers in addition if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws our business may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties

we are required to comply with environmental health and safety laws at our operations around the world the costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business

we are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us and abroad including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste and the emission of greenhouse gases from our manufacturing processes these laws impose liability for the costs of and damages resulting from cleaning up current sites past spills disposals and other releases of hazardous substances these laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to fees penalties costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business laws and regulations related to the environment product content and product safety are complex change often and can be open to different interpretations in addition we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers particularly in emerging markets 

we have accrued liabilities for the environmental cleanup of certain sites including the eleven sites for which us governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party as of our 2019 fiscal yearend where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities the actual expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets

export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of some of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons while we train our employees to comply with these regulations use third party screening software and take other measures we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur a prohibited shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties fines civil 

and criminal sanctions and reputational harm any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business

some of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception if we fail to comply with export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions or other laws we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including economic sanctions against us incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we were held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance

we have various types of insurance including property workers’ compensation general and excess liability and environmental liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may materially adversely impact our business we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings

as of december 28 2019 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at eleven waste disposal or waste recycling sites that are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination no settlement of our liability related to any of these sites has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at these sites and anticipate that our share of remediation costs will be determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with the epa or other governmental authorities

we have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss or cost will be incurred and the amount of loss or cost can be reasonably estimated these estimates could change as a result of changes in planned remedial actions remediation technologies site conditions the estimated time to complete remediation environmental laws and regulations and other factors because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities our future expenses to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly in addition we may be identified as a prp at additional sites in the future the range of expenses for remediation of any futureidentified sites would be addressed as they arise until then a range of expenses for such remediation cannot be determined

as of december 28 2019 our accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was 214 million

in addition we are involved in various lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters most of which are routine to the nature of our business we have accrued liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation future expenses to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly additional lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future the range of expenses for resolving any future matters would be assessed as they arise until then a range of potential expenses for such resolution cannot be determined based upon current information we believe that the impact of the resolution of these matters would not be individually or in the aggregate material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

business overview and reportable segments 

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products we sell most of our pressuresensitive materials to label printers and converters that convert the materials into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting we sell other pressuresensitive materials in converted form as tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of other converted products and items not involving pressuresensitive components such as fasteners tickets tags radiofrequency identification rfid inlays and tags and imprinting equipment and related solutions which serve the apparel and other end markets 

our reportable segments for fiscal year 2018 were 

• label and graphic materials lgm • retail branding and information solutions rbis and • industrial and healthcare materials ihm in 2018 the lgm rbis and ihm segments made up approximately 68 22 and 10 respectively of our total sales 

in 2018 international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business representing approximately 77 of our sales as of december 29 2018 we operated approximately 180 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide with approximately 30000 employees and operations in over 50 countries 

lgm segment 

our lgm segment manufactures and sells fasson® jac® and avery dennison®brand pressuresensitive label and packaging materials avery dennison® and mactac®brand graphics and avery dennison®brand reflective products the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products 

pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with internallydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with speciallycoated backing papers and films they are sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings and are available in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four layers a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an 

adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive from premature contact with other surfaces that can also serve as a carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive so that the label or other face material may be pressed or rolled into place because they are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared to other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives and offer aesthetic and other advantages over alternative technologies 

label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label converters for labeling decorating and specialty applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials are also used to convey variable information such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials which can be made into labels of varying sizes and shapes 

our graphics and reflective products include a variety of films and other products that are sold to the architectural commercial sign digital printing and other related market segments we also sell durable cast and reflective films to the construction automotive and fleet transportation market segments and reflective films for traffic and safety applications we provide sign shops commercial printers and designers a broad range of pressuresensitive materials to enable them to create impactful and informative brand and decorative graphics we have an array of pressuresensitive vinyl and specialty materials designed for digital imaging screen printing and sign cutting applications

rbis segment 

our rbis segment designs manufactures and sells a wide variety of branding and information solutions to retailers brand owners apparel manufacturers distributors and industrial customers this segment experiences some seasonality with higher volume generally in advance of the spring fall backtoschool and holiday shipping periods in recent years as the apparel industry has moved to more frequent seasonal updates this segment has experienced less seasonality 

the branding solutions of rbis include creative services brand embellishments graphic tickets tags and labels and sustainable packaging rbis information solutions include itemlevel rfid solutions visibility and loss prevention solutions price ticketing and marking care content and country of origin compliance solutions and brand protection and security solutions 

in the rbis segment our primary competitors include checkpoint systems inc a subsidiary of ccl industries inc rpac international corporation and sml group limited we believe that our global distribution network reliable service product quality and consistency and ability to serve customers consistently with comprehensive solutions wherever they manufacture are the key advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position

for tapes and bonding solutions our primary competitors include 3m tesase a subsidiary of beiersdorf ag nitto denko corporation and various regional firms we believe that entry of competitors into this field is limited by technical knowledge and capital requirements we believe that our technical expertise size and scale of operations broad line of quality products and new product innovation are the most significant advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position in this business for vancive products we compete with a variety of specialized medical tapes and converted products suppliers ranging from startups to multinational companies we believe that entry into the medical solutions business is limited by capital and regulatory requirements for fastener products there are a variety of competitors supplying extruded and injection molded fasteners and fastener attaching equipment they range from smaller regional competitors to multinational companies we believe that entry into this business is limited by capital requirements and technical knowledge for both our vancive and fastener solutions businesses we believe that our ability to serve our customers with highquality costeffective solutions and our innovation capabilities are the most significant factors in developing our competitive position 

raw materials 

in 2018 we experienced raw material inflation in most of our markets worldwide in response we continued to reengineer our products and drive savings through our procurement function as well as raise prices these actions largely offset the raw material inflation we experienced during the year while we have received sufficient quantities of raw materials to meet our production requirements to date it is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have we have avoided disruption to our manufacturing operations through carefully managing our existing raw material inventories and maintaining strategic relationships with our suppliers and additional supply sources 

research and development 

many of our products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving productivity sustainability and product performance often in close association with customers these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries in our lgm and ihm segments additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid and external embellishments in our rbis segment and medical technologies in our ihm segment for both of which we hold and license a number of patents 

patents trademarks and licenses 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery dennison our logo and fasson we believe these trademarks are strong in the market segments in which we compete 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials – primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources – that are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere or contaminate soil or groundwater emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors described in this section as well as the matters generally described in this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated herein by reference could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline this list of risks is not exhaustive our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the primary ones described in this section 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political and market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2018 approximately 77 of our sales were from international operations we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign earnings and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

macroeconomic developments such as slower growth in the geographic regions in which we operate the restructuring of european sovereign and other debt obligations the continuing uncertainty surrounding the exit of the united kingdom uk from the european union commonly known as brexit and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations in currencies such as the value of the euro chinese renminbi and argentine peso in 2018 can result in a variety of negative effects including lower revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles 

we continue to face uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the us and many of its trading partners during 2018 the us government imposed tariffs on products imported into the us this resulted in reciprocal tariffs on goods imported from the us into china the european union mexico canada and a few other countries the impacts on our operations to date have been insignificant there remains a significant risk that additional tariffs or other restrictions could be imposed on products imported from these or other countries or that relations with these countries could more broadly deteriorate these countries could retaliate by imposing similar tariffs or restrictions on products exported from the us any of these actions or further developments in us trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political social or economic instability and unrest – such as civil political and economic disturbances in countries such as russia ukraine syria iraq iran turkey north korea and the related impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have material adverse effects on our business we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic political or market conditions in the us or other countries 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or offset raw material and labor costs raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business 

the environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile impacting availability and pricing additionally energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable shortages 

and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and could recur in 2018 we announced targeted price increases in our lgm segment in all regions to address raw material inflation our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising the selling prices for our products and improving productivity 

also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers we may experience supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events or our existing relationships with suppliers could be terminated in the future any such disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are affected by changes in our markets due to competitive conditions technological developments laws and regulations and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively or respond appropriately to these market changes it could reduce market demand or we could lose market share or be forced to reduce selling prices to maintain market share which could materially adversely affect our business 

we are at risk that existing or new competitors which include some of our customers distributors and suppliers will expand in our key market segments or develop new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or new technologies 

we are also at risk that changes in consumer preferences or laws and regulations related to the use of plastics could reduce demand for our products we have developed new products to address the need for increased recyclability of plastic packaging and are developing new solutions to address this challenge in collaboration with our customers and the businesses in our supply chain there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful and a significant reduction in the use of plastic packaging could materially adversely affect demand for our products 

we also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customers ability to achieve incentive targets changes in customers preferences for our products can also affect demand for our products and a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business for example in 2016 we announced a program loss in personal care tapes that had a significant negative impact on the results of our ihm segment in 2016 and 2017 

we have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and employees 

to grow existing businesses and expand into new areas we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue doing so in 2016 we completed the acquisition of the european business of mactac a leading manufacturer of highquality pressuresensitive materials serving several graphics specialty labels and industrial tapes segments for 220 million in 2017 we completed the following acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately 340 million yongle tape ltd a chinabased manufacturer of specialty tapes and related products used in a variety of industrial markets finesse medical ltd an irelandbased manufacturer of healthcare products used in the management of wound care and skin conditions and the net assets of hanita coatings rural cooperative association limited an israelbased pressuresensitive manufacturer of specialty films and laminates and stock of certain of its subsidiaries although we did not make any acquisitions in 2018 we continued to evaluate potential targets and ensure we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities 

various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls employees product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain in addition we may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify valueaccretive targets or execute additional acquisitions in the future 

because some of our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties and their customers 

some of our products are sold not only by us but also by thirdparty distributors some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions including economic weakness market trends or industry consolidation or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also occasionally use thirdparty manufacturers to optimize production efficiencies manage capacity overflow and produce specialty jobs particularly in our rbis segment outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and noncompliance with customer requirements while we have stringent onboarding processes and continuous performance assessments for these outsourced manufacturers we may experience quality issues and customer dissatisfaction that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our operations and activities outside of the us may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations 

a substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the us and in 2018 the substantial majority of our sales was generated from customers located outside of the us international operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors suppliers distributors and customers in certain of these markets changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including nationally regionally and locally materially adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to sales operations taxes employment and legal proceedings establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations such as the uks bribery act of 2010 differences in lending practices challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations and differences in languages cultures and time zones 

there is also continued uncertainty as to how brexit will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the european union and the uk as well as whether other countries in the european union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region while our operations in the uk are relatively small the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any laws or regulations in the european union or the uk could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation sales and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations in addition product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation 

there are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design these issues are often discovered before shipping causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds or loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands we also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as our business environment changes we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses we undertook a multiyear transformation of our rbis segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our gotomarket strategy optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint in addition we have initiated restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability such as the restructuring of the european footprint of our lgm business which began in 2018 and continues in 2019 as we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies we may invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or could prove unprofitable we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies which involve operational complexities consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort if we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions our costs could increase our assets could be impaired and our returns on investments could be lower 

our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets including china which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions civil unrest economic volatility and other risks applicable to international operations 

an increasing amount of our sales are derived from emerging markets including countries in asia latin america and eastern europe the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our longterm growth strategy and our regional results can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions for example while china and other emerging markets continued to contribute positively to our results in 2018 we believe that local economic conditions negatively impacted our results in china for the year our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in china including as a result of its response to recent tariffs instituted by the us government on goods imported from china our ability to operate in china may be adversely affected by changes in chinese laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs raw materials environmental regulations land use rights property foreign currency conversion the regulation of private enterprises and other matters 

if we are unable to successfully expand our business in china or other emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries our financial performance could be materially adversely affected in addition to the risks applicable to our international operations factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these emerging markets include the lack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions civil unrest or economic volatility these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power reducing demand for our products or impairing our ability to achieve our longterm goals 

if we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications we could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements to current products helps determine our success many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with our customers or end users these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries in our lgm and ihm segments additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid and external embellishments in our rbis segment and medical technologies in our ihm segment for both of which we hold and license a number of patents however research and development is complex and uncertain requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and as a result could compromise our competitive position 

misassessment of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate in recent years we expanded our manufacturing facility located in kunshan china moved our rbis vietnam business into a new expanded facility are in the process of closing an lgm facility in germany and consolidating those operations with operations in luxembourg and belgium added a new coater to meet our projected demand for pressuresensitive tapes in china and made additional investments in capacity to support growth in our us graphics business our label and packaging materials businesses in asia and luxembourg and in rfid and heat transfer technology we are also in the process of adding additional lgm coating capacity in ohio and transferring our european ihm medical capacity from belgium to ireland in addition we added capacity through our recent acquisitions of mactac europe yongle tapes hanita coatings and finesse medical infrastructure investments which are longterm in nature may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures in execution and other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business 

our profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments for example we undertook a multiyear transformation of our rbis segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our gotomarket strategy optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint in addition we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in all our businesses which have in the past included and may continue to include facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation the restructuring of the european footprint of our lgm business which began in 2018 and continues in 2019 

is an example the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may materially adversely affect our business 

the substantial majority of our sales in 2018 was in foreign currencies we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies such as the euro and the chinese yuan renminbi which can cause transaction translation and other losses and could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional and translational exposure to changes in foreign currencies for example as of december 29 2018 €255 million of our €500 million in senior notes was designated as a net investment hedge of our investment in foreign operations to mitigate our foreign currency translation exposure the effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates further hedging activities may offset only a portion or none at all of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations 

continued concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the eurozone could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies potentially dislocating the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces its local currency could be significantly devalued the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing operations could substantially increase and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected furthermore if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars 

difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect some of our accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments were to occur our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in our tax rates could affect our earnings 

our effective tax rate in any period could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation including among others the us tax cuts and jobs act the tcja enacted in december 2017 there can be no assurance that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

the tcja may materially adversely affect our business 

the tcja significantly changed the income taxation of us corporations by among other things reducing the federal corporate income tax rate eliminating domestic manufacturing deductions limiting deductions of interest expense and executive compensation adopting elements of a modified territorial tax system by providing a dividend received deduction for certain distributions from foreign subsidiaries imposing a onetime transition tax on a deemed repatriation of all undistributed earnings and profits of certain usowned foreign corporations transition tax revising the rules governing foreign tax credits and introducing antibase erosion provisions the provisions of the tcja are subject to further amendments interpretations regulations as well as the results of pending or future litigation any of which could increase or decrease one or more impacts of the legislation the full impact of these changes on our state and local corporate taxes which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities continues to develop 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially and adversely impact our business 

corporate tax reform prevention of baseerosion and tax transparency continue to be high priorities of many tax jurisdictions in which we do business as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes are under heightened scrutiny globally while tax reform legislation has been proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions 

in addition many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperations base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy with changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities or legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change 

due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial change in international corporate tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our business generally 

our inability to secure or sustain certain tax benefits in a foreign jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business 

our effective tax rate reflected benefits from concessionary tax rates in foreign jurisdictions due to a foreign tax law change one of the concessionary tax rates that historically provided a 5 to 6 effective tax rate benefit is in a phaseout period to mitigate the permanent loss of this benefit we executed a discrete foreign tax planning action in the fourth quarter of 2018 that ended this historical benefit but enabled our pursuit of other potential tax planning opportunities if successful this action may substantially replace the expiring benefits once fully implemented we are unable to determine the ultimate success of this action and our inability to effectuate this tax planning strategy could materially adversely affect our business 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

we are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to 

determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes in addition tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years including continued actions by the european commission related to illegal state aid with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues requires significant judgment and is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at the time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards is concentrated in luxembourg decreases in the statutory tax rate in luxembourg could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of risks including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses social engineering phishing ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions for example we are in the process of investing in information technology to upgrade the systems in both our lgm north america business and rbis segment to drive business efficiency and supply chain productivity processes affected by these implementations include among other things order management pricing shipping purchasing general accounting and planning we have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology processes which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer  

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form which is stored in data centers and on our networks and thirdparty cloud services including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and 

updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions additionally we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised 

any such breach or attack could compromise our network the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential proprietary or personal information a data center where we have stored such information or a thirdparty cloud service provider and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation impair our ability to conduct business or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property contractual provisions with third parties including cloud service providers may limit our ability to recover these losses if personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or decline in morale and we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including for example the general data protection regulation in the eu the cyber security law in china the general data protection law in brazil and the state of californias consumer privacy act of 2018 – and although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident 

from time to time we have experienced unauthorized intrusions into our network and although these intrusions did not have a material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case in the future we have taken many steps to improve the security of our networks and computer systems including conducting user education and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data implementing multifactor authentication and advanced malware detection measures upgrading legacy information technology systems establishing a data loss prevention framework to better identify and protect our critical data conducting third party penetration testing to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity network and site access controls and improving our capabilities based on publicized incidents experienced by other companies as well as ones that we have experienced despite their minimal operational or financial impact to date we regularly review the effectiveness of our cybersecurity preparedness program using a dashboard of key performance indicators despite these and other mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information in data centers and on the cloud are taking similar precautions or that we will not continue to experience future intrusions 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees in particular due to expansion to additional geographies and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees if we do not offer marketcompetitive employment and compensation terms if we fail to recruit or retain our key management or sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we could experience 

disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy 

executive succession planning is also important to our longterm success we experienced several recent key management changes including promotions of longserving and experienced leaders to the positions of chief executive officer in 2016 and chief financial officer in 2017 as well as the departure of the vice presidentgeneral manager of our ihm segment in 2018 while we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our key management or other highlyskilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses andor increase costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing relationships if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

we have various nonus collective labor arrangements which make us subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our business 

work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale in addition collective bargaining agreements union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly if any of our suppliers were to experience a work stoppage they could halt or limit supplies of products necessary for business which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our stock price may be volatile which among other things could cause our tax rate to vary significantly 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which experienced a decline in 2018 and may in the future experience substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors as well as market expectations of our performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially adversely affect our stock price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not be volatile in the future 

in any period in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the stockbased compensation vesting or being exercised in that period we are required to recognize excess tax benefits that would decrease our effective tax rate conversely if our stock price is lower than the grant price of the stockbased compensation vesting or being exercised in that period we are required to recognize tax charges that would increase our effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 reflected an approximately 14 decrease as a result of the excess tax benefits we recognized on stockbased compensation during the year this tax effect is dependent on our stock price and there can be no assurance that we will recognize similar levels of excess tax benefits in future years 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

at december 29 2018 we had approximately 197 billion of debt including the 500 million of senior notes we issued in december 2018 our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited and we were required to obtain shortterm funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2018 our average variablerate borrowings were approximately 453 million increases in shortterm interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment however over the past few years the us federal reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate now between 225 and 25 at times indicating that additional increases in 2019 could occur which may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact our stock price 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness incur certain liens on our assets make certain investments sell our assets or merge with third parties and enter into certain transactions we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions these restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our longterm best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business 

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets in addition we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities which could result in charges in the nearer term in 2016 we incurred approximately 41 million in noncash charges in connection with the lumpsum settlement of certain pension obligations to terminated vested employees in our us pension plan which reduced our pension liability by approximately 70 million in september 2018 we terminated our us pension plan in connection with the termination we contributed 200 million to the plan in august 2018 using us commercial paper borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2018 we settled approximately 152 million of our us pension plan liability through lumpsum payments from existing plan assets to eligible participants who elected to receive them and recorded approximately 85 million of noncash charges associated with these settlements we expect to settle the remaining liability of approximately 792 million through the purchase 

of a group annuity contracts from one or more yettobeidentified highly rated insurance companies in the first half of 2019 see note 6 pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in our 2018 annual report 

our investment management of our us pension plan assets utilizes a liability driven investment ldi strategy under an ldi strategy the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio that consists primarily of investment grade fixed income securities and cash this strategy is intended to more closely match the liabilities of the plan the investment objective of the portfolio is to improve the funded status of the plan as funded status reaches certain trigger points the portfolio moves to a more conservative asset allocation hedging more of the interest rate risk of the plans liabilities the investment portfolio is designed to hedge the plans liabilities and balance risk and return within the limits of prudent risktaking and section 404 of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended 

we continue to evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolios overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline 

the level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

we evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or mortality rates our pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations our pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could also be affected by future legislation or regulation 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present as of december 29 2018 the carrying value of our goodwill was 9418 million we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made 

unfavorable developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters could impact us in a materially adverse manner 

there can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation investigation or other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters see legal proceedings part i item 3 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uks bribery act of 2010 if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including regulatory fines monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers in addition if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties 

we are required to comply with environmental health and safety laws at our operations around the world the costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business 

we are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us and abroad including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes these laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to fees penalties costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business environmental and product content and product safety laws and regulations can be complex change often and be open to different interpretations in addition we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers particularly in emerging markets 

we have accrued liabilities for the environmental cleanup of certain sites including the thirteen sites for which us governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party as of our 2018 fiscal yearend where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see legal proceedings part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities the actual expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets 

export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of some of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons while we train our employees to comply with these regulations use third party screening software and take other measures we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur a prohibited shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties fines civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business 

some of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception if we fail to comply with export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions or other laws we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including economic sanctions against us incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we were held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation general and excess liability and environmental liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may materially adversely impact our business we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 29 2018 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites that are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination no settlement of our liability related to any of the sites has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at these sites and anticipate that our share of remediation costs will be determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with the epa or other governmental authorities 

we have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss or cost will be incurred and the amount of loss or cost can be reasonably estimated these estimates could change as a result of changes in planned remedial actions remediation technologies site conditions the estimated time to complete remediation environmental laws and regulations and other factors because of the uncertainties 

associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expenses to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly in addition we may be identified as a prp at additional sites in the future the range of expenses for remediation of any futureidentified sites would be addressed as they arise until then a range of expenses for such remediation cannot be determined 

as of december 29 2018 our accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was 20 million 

in addition we are involved in various lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters most of which are routine to the nature of our business we have accrued liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation future expenses to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly additional lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future the range of expenses for resolving any future matters would be assessed as they arise until then a range of potential expenses for such resolution cannot be determined based upon current information we believe that the impact of the resolution of these matters would not be individually or in the aggregate material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

business overview and reportable segments 

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products we sell most of our pressuresensitive materials to label printers and converters that convert the materials into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting we sell other pressuresensitive materials in converted form as tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of other converted products and items not involving pressuresensitive components such as fasteners tickets tags radiofrequency identification rfid inlays and tags and imprinting equipment and related services which we market to retailers apparel manufacturers and brand owners 

our reportable segments for fiscal year 2017 were 

• label and graphic materials lgm • retail branding and information solutions rbis and • industrial and healthcare materials ihm in 2017 the lgm rbis and ihm segments made up approximately 68 23 and 9 respectively of our total sales 

in 2017 international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business representing approximately 76 of our sales as of december 30 2017 we operated approximately 180 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide with approximately 30000 employees and had operations in over 50 countries 

label and graphic materials segment 

our lgm segment manufactures and sells fasson® jac® and avery dennison®brand pressuresensitive label and packaging materials avery dennison® and mactac®brand graphics and avery dennison®brand reflective products the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products 

pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with internallydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with speciallycoated backing papers and films they are sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings and are available in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four layers a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an 

adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive from premature contact with other surfaces which can also serve as a carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive so that the label or other face material may be pressed or rolled into place because they are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared to other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives and offer aesthetic and other advantages over alternative technologies 

label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label converters for labeling decorating and specialty applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials are also used to convey variable information such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials which can be made into labels of varying sizes and shapes

research and development 

many of our products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving productivity and product performance often in close association with customers these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries in our lgm and ihm segments additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid and external embellishments in our rbis segment and medical technologies in our ihm segment for both of which we hold and license a number of patents 

our expenses for research and development were 934 million in 2017 897 million in 2016 and 919 million in 2015 

patents trademarks and licenses 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery dennison our logo and fasson we believe these trademarks are strong in the market segments in which we compete 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials – primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources – that are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere or contaminate soil or groundwater emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors described below as well as the matters generally described in this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated herein by reference could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline the risks described below are not exhaustive our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the primary ones described below 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political and market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2017 approximately 76 of our sales were from international operations we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign earnings and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

macroeconomic developments such as slower growth in certain regions the ongoing restructuring efforts relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations the continuing uncertainty surrounding the exit of the united kingdom uk from the european union the weakening or strengthening of local economies in which we operate and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to the loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations in currencies such as the value of the euro and the british pound in 2017 can result in a variety of negative effects including lower revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles 

we continue to face uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the us and many of its trading partners there remains a significant risk that tariffs or other restrictions could be imposed on products imported from china mexico or other countries or that relations with these countries could 

more broadly deteriorate these countries could retaliate by imposing similar tariffs or restrictions on products exported from the us any of these actions or further developments in us trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political social or economic instability and unrest – such as the ongoing civil political and economic disturbances in places like russia ukraine syria iraq iran turkey north korea and the related impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have material adverse effects on our business we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic political or market conditions in the us or other countries 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or offset raw material and labor costs raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business 

the environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile impacting availability and pricing additionally energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and could recur our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising the selling prices for our products and improving productivity for example in 2017 we announced targeted price increases in our lgm segment in all regions to address our outlook for raw material inflation including in china the us and certain countries in europe 

also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers we may experience supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events or our existing relationships with suppliers could be terminated in the future any such disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share or reduce selling prices to maintain market share which could materially adversely affect our business 

we are at risk that our competitors which include certain of our customers distributors and suppliers will expand in our key market segments and implement new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 

we also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customers ability to achieve incentive targets changes in customers preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business for example in 2016 we announced a program loss in personal care tapes that had a negative impact on our business during 2016 and 2017 compared to the prior year 

we have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and employees 

to grow existing businesses and expand into new areas we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue doing so in 2016 we completed the acquisition of the european business of mactac a leading manufacturer of highquality pressuresensitive materials serving several graphics specialty labels and industrial tapes segments for 220 million in 2017 we completed the following acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately 360 million yongle tape ltd a chinabased manufacturer of specialty tapes and related products used in a variety of industrial markets finesse medical ltd an irelandbased manufacturer of healthcare products used in the management of wound care and skin conditions and the net assets of hanita coatings rural cooperative association limited an israelbased pressuresensitive manufacturer of specialty films and laminates and stock of certain of its subsidiaries various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls employees product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain in addition we may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify or execute new acquisition opportunities in the future 

because some of our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties 

some of our products are sold not only by us but also by thirdparty distributors some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions including economic weakness market trends or industry consolidation or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also occasionally use thirdparty manufacturers to optimize production efficiencies manage capacity overflow and produce specialty jobs particularly in our rbis segment outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and noncompliance with customer requirements while we have stringent onboarding processes and continuous performance assessments for these outsourced manufacturers we may experience quality issues and customer dissatisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our operations and activities outside of the us may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations  

a substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the us and for the year ended december 30 2017 approximately 76 of our sales were generated from customers located outside of the us international operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors suppliers distributors and customers in certain of these markets changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including nationally regionally and locally materially adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to sales operations taxes employment and legal 

proceedings establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations including the united kingdoms bribery act of 2010 differences in lending practices challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations and differences in languages cultures and time zones 

the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved the uks exit from the european union commonly known as brexit the immediate impact of brexit was a significant decline in the value of the british pound compared to the us dollar there may be further volatility in the value of the british pound and the economic stability of the uk which may affect our ability to sell products in the uk there is also continued uncertainty as to how brexit will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the uk and european union as well as whether other countries in the european union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region while our operations in the uk are relatively small legal and regulatory changes in this region could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation sales and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations in addition product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation 

there are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design these issues are often discovered before shipping causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds or loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands we also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as our business environment changes we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses we are in the process of a multiyear transformation of our rbis segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our gotomarket strategy optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint in addition we have initiated restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability as we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies we may invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or unprofitable for example in 2015 we exited one of our anticipated growth platforms in our ihm segment to refocus our efforts on more profitable strategic alternatives we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies which involve operational complexities consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort if we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions our costs could increase our assets could be impaired and our returns on investments could be lower 

our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions civil unrest economic volatility and other risks applicable to international operations 

an increasing amount of our sales are derived from emerging markets including countries in asia latin america and eastern europe the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our longterm growth strategy and our regional results can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions which occurred with our results in china in 2016 our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in china our ability to operate in china may be adversely affected by changes in chinese laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs raw materials environmental regulations land use rights property foreign currency conversion the regulation of private enterprises and other matters 

if we are unable to successfully expand our business in china or other emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries our financial performance could be materially adversely affected in addition to the risks applicable to our international operations factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these emerging markets include the lack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions civil unrest or economic volatility these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power reducing demand for our products or impairing our ability to achieve our longterm goals 

if we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications we could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with our customers or end users these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries in our lgm and ihm segments additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid and external embellishments in our rbis segment and medical technologies in our ihm segment for both of which we hold and license a number of patents however research and development is complex and uncertain requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and as a result could compromise our competitive position 

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate in recent years we expanded our manufacturing facility located in kunshan china moved our rbis vietnam business into a new expanded facility added a new coater to meet our projected demand for pressuresensitive tapes in china and made additional investments in capacity to support growth in our us graphics business in asia and luxembourg and in rfid and heat transfer technology in addition we added capacity through our recent acquisitions of mactac europe yongle tapes hanita coatings and finesse medical infrastructure investments which are longterm in nature may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete implementation and other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business 

our future profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments for example we are in the process of a multiyear transformation of our rbis segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our gotomarket strategy optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint in addition we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in our operations which have in the past included and may continue to include facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may materially adversely affect our business 

with approximately 76 of our sales for the fiscal year ending december 30 2017 arising from foreign sales we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies such as the euro and the chinese yuan renminbi which can cause transaction translation and other losses and could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional and translational exposure to changes in foreign currencies for example in 2017 we designated our €500 million senior notes as a net investment hedge of our investment in foreign operations to mitigate our foreign currency translation exposure the effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates further hedging activities may only offset a portion or none at all of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations 

continued concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the eurozone could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies potentially dislocating the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces its local currency could be significantly devalued the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing operations could substantially increase and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected furthermore if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars 

difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect certain accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation including among others the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja enacted on december 22 2017 in the us there can be no assurance that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

the tcja may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the tcja has significantly changed the federal income taxation of us corporations by among other things reducing the federal corporate income tax rate limiting interest deductions permitting certain capital expenditures to be expensed immediately adopting elements of a modified territorial tax system imposing a onetime transition tax on a deemed repatriation of all undistributed earnings and profits of certain usowned foreign corporations transition tax revising the rules governing foreign tax credits and introducing new antibase erosion provisions certain changes became effective immediately while others become effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the legislation is unclear in certain respects and may be subject to technical amendments as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the department of treasury and internal revenue service any of which could increase or decrease one or more impacts of the legislation it is also unclear how these changes will affect state and local corporate taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities 

while our analysis and interpretation of the tcja is ongoing based on our current evaluation the reduction of the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 required a writedown of our net deferred income tax assets resulting in an estimated material noncash charge against earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 the period in which the tcja was enacted this and other impacts of the tcja are subject to further adjustments in subsequent periods throughout 2018 in accordance with recent interpretive guidance issued by the sec under staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 similarly the transition tax resulted in a material charge against income in the fourth quarter of 2017 the limitation on interest deductions may negatively impact our effective tax rate and cash flows going forward there may be material adverse effects resulting from the tcja of which we have not yet completed our analysis these effects may relate to the potential adjustments described above or future guidance and regulations 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 

in 2017 approximately 76 of our sales were generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees were located outside of the us while we are taxed by local authorities on earnings from these sales we have historically not accrued us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on most of our undistributed earnings and profits for nonus subsidiaries because we intend to indefinitely reinvest in the operations of those subsidiaries the tcja imposed a onetime transition tax subjecting the undistributed earnings and profits of our nonus subsidiaries to immediate us taxation and eliminated future foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes or withholding taxes paid with respect to certain foreign dividends as a result we accrued foreign withholding taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 for certain jurisdictions related to the future repatriation of cash and cash equivalents as of december 30 2017 we continue to evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertions which may be subject to adjustments throughout 2018 in accordance with sab 118 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many of the jurisdictions in which we do business as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny while tax reform legislation has been 

proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions for example the tcja enacted broad us corporate income tax reform including the changes described above the tcja affected the tax position reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and financial results in fiscal year 2017 our cash tax payments in the us starting in fiscal year 2018 may also be affected 

in addition many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperations base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy with changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities or legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change 

due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial change in international corporate tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our business generally 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

we are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes in addition tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years including continued actions by the european commission related to illegal state aid with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at the time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our future results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of risks including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses social engineering phishing ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions for 

example we are in the process of investing in information technology to upgrade the systems in both our lgm north america business and rbis segment to drive business efficiency and supply chain productivity we have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology processes which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer  

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form which is stored in data centers and on our networks and thirdparty cloud services including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions additionally we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised 

any such breach or attack could compromise our network the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential proprietary or personal information a data center where we have stored such information or a thirdparty cloud service provider and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation impair our ability to conduct business or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property contractual provisions with third parties including cloud service providers may limit our ability to recover these losses if personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or morale and we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including for example the general data protection regulation in the eu and the cyber security law in china – and although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident 

from time to time we have experienced unauthorized intrusions into our network and although these intrusions did not have a material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case going forward we have taken many steps to improve the security of our networks and computer systems including user education and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data implementing multifactor authentication and advanced malware detection measures upgrading legacy information technology systems and establishing a data loss prevention framework to better identify and protect our critical data despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information in data centers and on the cloud are taking similar precautions or that we will not continue to experience future intrusions 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees in particular due to expansion to additional geographies and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees if we do not offer marketcompetitive employment and compensation terms if we fail to recruit or retain our key management or sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy 

executive succession planning is also important to our longterm success for example we experienced several recent key management changes including promotions of longserving and experienced leaders to the positions of chief executive officer and chief financial officer in 2016 and 2017 respectively while we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving any of our key management or other highlyskilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses andor increase costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing relationships if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

we have various nonus collective labor arrangements which make us subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our business 

work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale in addition collective bargaining agreements union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our share price may be volatile 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which has at times experienced and may in the future experience substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors as well as market expectations of our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially adversely affect our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not be volatile in the future 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited and we were required to obtain shortterm funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2017 our average variablerate borrowings were approximately 256 million increases in shortterm interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment however over the past few years the us federal reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate now between 125 and 15 indicating that additional increases would be likely which may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact the market price of our common stock 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness incur certain liens on our assets make certain investments sell our assets or merge with third parties and enter into certain transactions we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions these restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our longterm best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business 

the level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

we evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or mortality rates our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could also be affected by future legislation or regulation 

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets in addition we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities which could result in charges in the nearer term in 2016 we incurred approximately 41 million in noncash charges in connection with the lumpsum settlement of certain pension obligations to terminated vested employees in our us pension plan which reduced our pension liability by approximately 70 million we continue to evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolios overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made 

unfavorable developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters could impact us in a materially adverse manner 

there can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation investigation or other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters see legal proceedings part i item 3 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uks bribery act of 2010 if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including regulatory fines monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers in addition if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties 

we are required to comply with environmental health and safety laws at our operations around the world the costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business 

we are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us and abroad including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our 

manufacturing processes these laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future fees penalties costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business environmental and product content and product safety laws and regulations can be complex change often and be open to different interpretations in addition we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers particularly in emerging markets 

we have accrued liabilities for the environmental cleanup of certain sites including sites for which us governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see legal proceedings part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets 

certain of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception if we fail to comply with export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions or other laws we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including economic sanctions against us incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

furthermore export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons while we train our employees to comply with these regulations we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur a prohibited shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties fines civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we were held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement 

entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation general liability and environmental liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may materially adversely impact our business we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 30 2017 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites that are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination no settlement of our liability related to any of the sites has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at these sites and anticipate that our share of remediation costs will be determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with the epa or other governmental authorities 

we have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss or cost will be incurred and the amount of loss or cost can be reasonably estimated these estimates could change as a result of changes in planned remedial actions remediation technologies site conditions the estimated time to complete remediation environmental laws and regulations and other factors because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expenses to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly in addition we may be identified as a prp at additional sites in the future the range of expenses for remediation of any futureidentified sites would be addressed as they arise until then a range of expenses for such remediation cannot be determined 

as of december 30 2017 our accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was 211 million 

in addition we are involved in various lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters most of which are routine to the nature of our business we have accrued liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation future expenses to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly additional lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future the range of expenses for resolving any future matters would be assessed as they arise until then a range of potential expenses for such resolution cannot be determined based upon current information we believe that the impact of the resolution of these matters would not be individually or in the aggregate material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

business overview and reportable segments 

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are sold to label printers and converters that convert the materials into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting some materials are sold by us in converted form as tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of other converted products and items not involving pressuresensitive components such as fasteners tickets tags radiofrequency identification rfid inlays and tags and imprinting equipment and related services which we market to retailers apparel manufacturers and brand owners 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we changed our operating structure to align with our overall business strategy and our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance as a result of these events our fiscal year 2016 results are reported based on our new reportable segments described below and in note 15 segment information we have reclassified certain prior period amounts to reflect our new operating structure 

our reportable segments for fiscal year 2016 were 

• label and graphic materials lgm • retail branding and information solutions rbis and • industrial and healthcare materials ihm these segment changes resulted in the movement of performance tapes previously part of the former pressuresensitive materials segment and fastener solutions previously part of rbis into the ihm segment 

in 2016 the lgm rbis and ihm segments made up approximately 69 24 and 7 respectively of our total sales 

in 2016 international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business representing approximately 75 of our sales as of december 31 2016 we operated approximately 180 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide and had operations in over 50 countries 

label and graphic materials segment 

our lgm segment manufactures and sells fasson® jac® and avery dennison®brand pressuresensitive label and packaging materials avery dennison® and mactac®brand graphics and avery 

dennison®brand reflective products the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products 

pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with companydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with specially coated backing papers and films they are sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings and are available in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four layers a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive from premature contact with other surfaces that can also serve as a carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive so that the label or other face material may be pressed or rolled into place because they are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared to other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives 

label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label converters for labeling decorating and special applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials are also used to convey a variety of variable information such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials which can be made into labels of varying sizes and shapes 

our graphics and reflective products include a variety of films and other products that are sold to the architectural commercial sign digital printing and other related market segments we also sell durable cast and reflective films to the construction automotive and fleet transportation market segments and reflective films for traffic and safety applications we provide sign shops commercial printers and designers a broad range of pressuresensitive materials to enable them to create impactful and informative brand and decorative graphics we have an array of pressuresensitive vinyl and specialty materials designed for digital imaging screen printing and sign cutting applications 

in the lgm segment our larger competitors in label and packaging materials include raflatac a subsidiary of upmkymmene corporation lintec corporation ritrama inc flexcon corporation inc and various regional firms for graphics and reflective products our largest competitors are 3m company 3m and the orafol group we believe that entry of competitors into the field of pressuresensitive adhesives and materials is limited by technical knowledge and capital requirements we believe that our technical expertise size and scale of operations broad line of quality products and service programs distribution capabilities brand strength and new product innovation are the primary advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position 

retail branding and information solutions segment 

our rbis segment designs manufactures and sells a wide variety of branding and information solutions to retailers brand owners apparel manufacturers distributors and industrial customers on a global basis this segment experiences some seasonality with higher volume generally in advance of the spring fall backtoschool and holiday shipping periods in recent years as the apparel industry has moved to more frequent seasonal updates this segment has experienced less seasonality than in previous years 

the branding solutions of rbis include creative services brand embellishments graphic tickets tags and labels and sustainable packaging rbis information solutions include itemlevel rfid solutions 

visibility and loss prevention solutions price ticketing and marking care content and country of origin compliance solutions and brand protection and security solutions 

in the rbis segment our primary competitors include checkpoint systems inc a subsidiary of ccl industries inc rpac international corporation and sml group limited we believe that our global distribution network reliable service product quality and consistency and ability to serve customers consistently with comprehensive solutions wherever they manufacture are the key advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position 

industrial and healthcare materials segment

research and development 

many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving productivity and product performance often in close association with customers these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid in our rbis segment and medical technologies in our ihm segment for both of which we hold and license a number of patents 

our expenses for research and development were 897 million in 2016 919 million in 2015 and 1025 million in 2014 

patents trademarks and licenses 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery dennison our logo and fasson we believe these trademarks are strong in the market segments in which our products compete 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials – primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources – that are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere or contaminate soil or groundwater emissions of and contamination by these substances are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors and risks discussed below as well as the matters generally described in this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated herein by reference could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline the risks described below are not exhaustive our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the ones described below 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political and market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2016 approximately 75 of our sales were from international operations we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign earnings and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

macroeconomic developments such as continued slower growth in china and parts of south america the ongoing restructuring efforts relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations the weakening of local economies in which we operate and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to the loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the decline in 2016 in the value of the british pound and declines in the value of the euro and chinese yuan renminbi seen in recent years these declines could result in a variety of negative effects including lower revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles 

due to recent changes in the us government we face uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the us and many of its trading partners there is significant risk that tariffs or other restrictions could be imposed on products imported from china mexico or other countries or that relations with these 

countries and us trading parties could more broadly deteriorate these countries could retaliate by imposing similar tariffs or restrictions on products exported from the us any of these actions or further developments in us trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political social or economic instability and unrest – such as the ongoing significant civil political and economic disturbances in places like russia ukraine syria iraq iran turkey and the related impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have material adverse effects on our business we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic political or market conditions in the us or other countries 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share or reduce selling prices to maintain market share which could materially adversely affect our business 

we are at risk that our competitors which include certain of our customers and distributors will expand in our key market segments and implement new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 

we also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customers ability to achieve incentive targets changes in customers preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business for example in 2016 we announced the loss of a specific customer personal care program that had a negative impact on our business during the year 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or pass on raw material and labor costs raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business 

the environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile impacting availability and pricing additionally energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and could recur in addition to verify our products as conflictfree as required by sec rules requiring disclosure concerning the use of certain minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries conflict mineral rules we could make alternative sourcing and supply decisions for materials used in certain of our products which could materially adversely affect our pricing terms our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on cost increases for raw materials to customers by raising the selling prices for our products and our ability to improve productivity depending on market dynamics and the terms of customer contracts our ability to recover any increased costs of obtaining raw materials from third party suppliers due to the conflict mineral rules or otherwise may be limited 

also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers we may experience supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events or our existing relationships with suppliers could be terminated in the future any such disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

because our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties 

our products are sold not only by us but also by thirdparty distributors as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions including economic weakness market trends or industry consolidation or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also occasionally use thirdparty manufacturers for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and noncompliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction deficiencies in the performance of outsourced manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our operations and activities outside of the us may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations  

a substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the us and for the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 75 of our sales were generated from customers located outside of the us international operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors suppliers distributors and customers in certain of these markets changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including nationally regionally and locally materially adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to sales corporate governance operations taxes employment and legal proceedings establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations including the united kingdoms bribery act of 2010 differences in lending practices challenges of complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations and differences in languages cultures and time zones 

the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in june 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved the uks exit from the european union commonly known as brexit the immediate impact of brexit was a significant decline in the value of the british pound compared to the us dollar there may be further volatility in the value of the british pound and the economic stability of the uk which may affect our ability to sell products in the uk there is also uncertainty as to how brexit will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the uk and european union as well as whether it may lead other countries in the european union to approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region while our operations in the uk are relatively small legal and regulatory changes in this region could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation sales and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations in addition product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our financial results or reputation 

there are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping causing delays in 

shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds or loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands we also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as our business environment changes we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses in 2015 we announced a multiyear transformation plan for our former rbis segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our gotomarket market strategy optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint in addition we have initiated restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability as we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies we may invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or unprofitable for example in the fourth quarter of 2015 we made the decision to exit one of our anticipated growth platforms in our former vancive segment in order to refocus our efforts on more profitable strategic alternatives we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies which involve operational complexities consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort if we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions our costs could increase our assets could be impaired and our returns on investments could be lower 

our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions civil unrest economic volatility and other risks applicable to international operations 

an increasing amount of our sales are derived from emerging markets including countries in asia latin america and eastern europe the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our longterm growth strategy and our regional results can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions which occurred with our results in china in 2016 if we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries our financial performance could be materially adversely affected in addition to the risks applicable to our international operations factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these developing and emerging markets include the lack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions civil unrest or economic volatility these factors could result in decreased consumer purchasing power reduced demand for our products or an impaired ability to achieve our longterm growth strategy thereby having a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications we could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research 

efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with our customers or end users these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid in our rbis segment and medical technologies in our ihm segment for both of which we hold and license a number of patents however research and development is complex and uncertain requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and as a result could compromise our competitive position 

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate for example in september 2015 we completed an expansion of our manufacturing facility located in kunshan china and added a new coater to meet our projected demand for pressuresensitive tapes in china in 2016 we announced additional investments in capacity to support growth in our us graphics business in asia and luxembourg and in rfid and heat transfer technology these infrastructure investments are longterm in nature and it is possible that these investments may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete implementation and other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business 

our future profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments for example in 2015 we announced a multiyear transformation plan for our former rbis segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our gotomarket strategy optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint in addition we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in our operations which have in the past included and may continue to include facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may materially adversely affect our business 

with approximately 75 of our sales for the fiscal year ending december 31 2016 arising from foreign sales we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies such as the euro the chinese yuan renminbi and the british pound which can cause transaction translation and other losses and could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies the effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates further hedging activities may only offset a portion or none at all of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency fluctuations 

additionally concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the eurozone could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies potentially dislocating the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces its local currency could be significantly devalued the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing operations could substantially increase and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected furthermore if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars 

we have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel 

to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions in the past and may do so in the future in 2016 we completed the acquisition of the european business of mactac a leading manufacturer of highquality pressuresensitive materials serving several graphics specialty labels and industrial tapes segments for 220 million we also announced our agreement to acquire hanita coatings a pressuresensitive materials manufacturer of specialty films and laminates for 75 million subject to customary adjustments in february 2017 we announced our agreement to acquire yongle tape company ltd a manufacturer of specialty tapes and related products used in a variety of industrial markets for 190 million which is subject to customary adjustments with an additional earnout opportunity of up to 55 million to be paid based on the acquired business achievement of certain performance targets over the next two years various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain particularly given our geographically dispersed organization in addition we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify or execute new acquisition opportunities in the future 

divestures of any of our businesses or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we continually evaluate the performance of our businesses and may determine to sell a business or product line while we believe these divestures are in the best interests of our longterm strategy they may result in significant writeoffs or impairments of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for example we completed the sale of certain of our assets and liabilities associated with a product line in our former rbis segment in may 2015 at a loss and incurred impairment charges as well as exit costs including costs associated with severance payments any future divestitures we undertake may also involve additional risks including separation of operations products and personnel diversion of management attention disruption to our other businesses and loss of key employees we may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront in divesting a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect certain accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation there can be no assurance that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

we are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes in addition tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years including recent actions by the european commission related to disallowed state aid with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at the time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our future results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

potential tax liabilities and proposed changes in us tax legislation could materially impact our business 

in 2016 approximately 75 of our sales were generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees were located outside of the us while we are taxed by local authorities on earnings from these sales we have not accrued us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on most of our unrepatriated earnings for nonus subsidiaries because we intend to indefinitely reinvest in the operations of those subsidiaries our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities may be materially adversely affected if tax rules regarding unrepatriated earnings change if changes in our domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings for which no tax provisions have been made or if the us international tax rules change as part of comprehensive tax reform or other tax legislation due to recent changes in the us government the impact of future changes in tax laws and regulations and their application by regulators are uncertain 

significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of risks including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses social engineering phishing or other malicious attacks and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of 

customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions for example in 2016 we announced investment in information technology to upgrade the systems in our north american label and graphic materials business and drive supply chain productivity we have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer  

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form which is stored in data centers and on our networks and thirdparty cloud services including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions additionally we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised 

any such breach or attack could compromise our network the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential proprietary or personal information a data center where we have stored such information or a thirdparty cloud service provider and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation impair our ability to conduct business or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property contractual provisions with third parties including cloud service providers may limit our ability to recover these losses if personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or morale and we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident 

from time to time we have experienced unauthorized intrusions into our network and although these intrusions did not have a material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case going forward following these attacks we have taken additional steps designed to improve the security of our networks and computer systems despite these defensive measures there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information in data centers and on the cloud are taking similar precautions or that we will not continue to experience future intrusions 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees in particular due to expansion to additional geographies and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees if we do not offer marketcompetitive employment and compensation terms if we fail to recruit or retain our key management or sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy 

executive succession planning is also important to our longterm success for example we experienced several recent key management changes including the appointments of a new chief financial officer in 2015 and a new chief executive officer in 2016 while we believe we have appropriate succession procedures in place any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving any of our key management or other highlyskilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses andor increase costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing relationships if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

we have one us collective bargaining unit and various nonus collective labor arrangements which make us subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our business 

work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale in addition collective bargaining agreements union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities to restructure our business because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our share price may be volatile 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which has at times experienced and may in the future experience substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors as well as market expectations of our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially adversely affect our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not be volatile in the future 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited and we were required to obtain shortterm funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2016 our average variablerate borrowings were approximately 281 million increases in shortterm interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay an assumed 20 basis point move in interest rates affecting our variablerate borrowings 10 of our weightedaverage interest rate on floating rate debt would have increased interest expense by approximately 5 million on variablerate borrowings in 2016 fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment however in december 2015 the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point for the first time since 2006 the us federal reserve raised this rate by an additional quarter of a percentage point in december 2016 and indicated that additional increases would likely be forthcoming in 2017 while it is unclear whether these actions suggest a change in previous monetary policy positions including but not limited to an elimination of quantitative easing over time any such change or market expectation of such change may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may be abrupt and may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact the market price of our common stock 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness incur certain liens on our assets make certain investments sell our assets or merge with third parties and enter into certain transactions we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions these restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our longterm best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business 

additional financings may dilute the holdings of our current shareholders 

in order to provide capital for the operation of our business we may enter into additional financing arrangements these arrangements may involve the issuance of new shares of preferred or common stock convertible debt securities andor warrants any of these issuances could result in a material increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding which would dilute the ownership interests of our existing common shareholders in addition any new securities could contain provisions such as priorities on distributions and voting rights that could materially adversely affect the value of our existing common stock 

the level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

we evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could also be affected by future legislation or regulation 

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets in addition we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities which could result in charges in the nearer term in 2016 we incurred approximately 41 million in noncash charges in connection with the lumpsum settlement of certain pension obligations to terminated vested employees in our us pension plan which reduced our pension liability by approximately 70 million although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolios overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made 

unfavorable developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters could impact us in a materially adverse manner 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matters see legal proceedings part i item 3 

in addition the requirements set forth in the conflict mineral rules required us to undertake due diligence efforts that are expected to continue into the future we expect to continue incurring costs 

associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of these verification activities our reputation may be harmed if we are not able to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals and metals used in our products 

there can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation investigation or other legal environmental compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uks bribery act of 2010 if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including regulatory fines monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers in addition if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties 

we are required to comply with global environmental health and safety laws the costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business 

we are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us and abroad including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business environmental and product content and product safety laws and regulations can be complex and change often we have accrued liabilities for the environmental cleanup of certain sites including sites for which us governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see legal proceedings part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets 

certain of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception if we fail to comply with export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions or other laws we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including economic sanctions against us incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

furthermore export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons while we train our employees to comply with these regulations we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur a prohibited shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties fines civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or 

related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we were held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation general liability and environmental liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may materially adversely impact our business we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our business 

healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

during 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 together the aca were signed into law in the us the complexities and ramifications of the aca are significant and continue to be implemented through a phased approach that is expected to continue over the next several years recent changes in the us government could lead to repeal of or changes in some or all of the aca complying with any new legislation andor reversing changes implemented under the aca could be timeintensive and expensive resulting in a material adverse effect on our business 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels for example there have been several changes to the aca since its enactment and the law is likely to continue to evolve to the 

extent it continues to be implemented in accordance with its current terms in addition the impact on our business of complying with the aca or any replacement law and responding to the effects of health care reform more broadly are not fully known any changes to our healthcare cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 31 2016 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites that are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination no settlement of our liability related to any of 

the sites has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at these sites and anticipate that our share of remediation costs will be determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with the epa or other governmental authorities 

we have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss or cost will be incurred and the amount of loss or cost can be reasonably estimated these estimates could change as a result of changes in planned remedial actions remediation technologies site conditions the estimated time to complete remediation environmental laws and regulations and other factors because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expenses to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly in addition we may be identified as a prp at additional sites in the future the range of expenses for remediation of any futureidentified sites would be addressed as they arise until then a range of expenses for such remediation cannot be determined 

as of december 31 2016 our accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was 213 million 

in addition we are involved in various lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters most of which are routine to the nature of our business we have accrued liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation future expenses to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly additional lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future the range of expenses for resolving any future matters would be assessed as they arise until then a range of potential expenses for such resolution cannot be determined based upon current information we believe that the impact of the resolution of these matters would not be individually or in the aggregate material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

research and development 

many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with customers these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink 

chemistries additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid in our rbis segment and medical technologies in vancive for both of which we hold and license a number of patents 

our expenses for research and development were 919 million in 2015 1025 million in 2014 and 96 million in 2013 

patents trademarks and licenses 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery dennison our logo and fasson we believe these trademarks are strong in the market segments in which our products compete 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials – primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources – that are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors and risks discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated herein by reference could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline the risks described below are not exhaustive our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide economic political and market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2015 approximately 74 of our sales were from international operations we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign earnings and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

macroeconomic developments such as continued slower growth in china and parts of south america the ongoing restructuring efforts relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations the weakening of local economies in which we operate and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to the loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the recent decline in the value of the euro and chinese yuan renminbi these declines could result in a variety of negative effects including lower revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles 

in addition business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political social or economic instability and unrest – such as the ongoing significant civil political and economic disturbances in places like russia ukraine syria iraq and the related impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have material adverse effects on our business we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic political or market conditions in the us or other countries 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share or reduce selling prices to maintain market share which could materially adversely affect our business 

we are at risk that our competitors which include certain of our distributors will expand in our key market segments and implement new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 

we also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customers ability to achieve incentive 

targets changes in customers preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or pass on raw material and labor costs raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business 

the environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile impacting availability and pricing additionally energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and could recur in addition we are subject to rules adopted by the sec pursuant to section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure concerning the use of certain minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries conflict mineral rules in an effort to verify our products as conflictfree we could make alternative sourcing and supply decisions for materials used in certain of our products which could materially adversely affect our pricing terms particularly if suppliers incur significant additional costs and expenses in making the determinations required to conduct this verification process or if the number of suppliers offering minerals identified as conflict free is limited our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on cost increases for raw materials to customers by raising the selling prices for our products and our ability to improve productivity depending on market dynamics and the terms of customer contracts our ability to recover any increased costs of complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements or obtaining raw materials from third party suppliers may be limited 

also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers we may experience supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events or our existing relationships with suppliers could be terminated in the future any such disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

because our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties 

our products are sold not only by us but also by thirdparty distributors as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions including economic weakness market trends or industry consolidation or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also occasionally use thirdparty manufacturers for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and noncompliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction deficiencies in the performance of outsourced manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our operations and activities outside of the us may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations 

a substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the us and for the year ended january 2 2016 approximately 74 of our sales were generated from customers located outside of the us international operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors suppliers distributors and customers in certain of these markets changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including nationally regionally and locally materially adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to sales corporate governance operations taxes employment and legal proceedings establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations including the united kingdoms bribery act of 2010 differences in lending practices challenges of complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations and differences in languages cultures and time zones 

the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation sales and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations in addition product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our financial results or reputation 

there are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds or loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands we also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as our business environment changes we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses in 2015 we announced a new multiyear plan for our rbis segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our gotomarket market strategy optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint in addition we have initiated restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability as we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies we may invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or unprofitable for example in the fourth quarter of 2015 we made the decision to exit one of our anticipated growth platforms in the vancive segment in order to refocus our efforts on more profitable strategic alternatives we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the 

intended results of any of our business strategies which involve operational complexities consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort if we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions our costs could increase our assets could be impaired and our returns on investments could be lower 

our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions civil unrest economic volatility and other risks applicable to international operations 

an increasing percentage of our sales are derived from emerging markets including countries in asia latin america and eastern europe the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our longterm growth strategy if we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries our financial performance could be materially adversely affected in addition to the risks applicable to our international operations factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these developing and emerging markets include the lack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions civil unrest or economic volatility these factors could result in decreased consumer purchasing power reduced demand for our products or an impaired ability to achieve our longterm growth strategy thereby having a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications we could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with our customers or end users these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid in our rbis segment and medical technologies in vancive for both of which we hold and license a number of patents however research and development is complex and uncertain requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and as a result could compromise our competitive position 

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate for example in september 2015 we completed an expansion of our manufacturing facility located in kunshan china and added a new coater to meet our projected demand for pressuresensitive tapes in china our investment in the kunshan facility and other infrastructure investments generally are longterm in nature and it is possible that these investments may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete implementation and other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business 

our future profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in our operations which have in the past included and may continue to include facility closures and square footage reductions headcount 

reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may materially adversely affect our business 

with approximately 74 of our sales for the fiscal year ending january 2 2016 arising from foreign sales we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies such as the euro the chinese yuan renminbi and the british pound which can cause transaction translation and other losses and could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies the effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates further hedging activities may only offset a portion or none at all of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency fluctuations 

additionally concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the eurozone could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies potentially dislocating the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces its local currency could be significantly devalued the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing operations could substantially increase and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected furthermore if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars 

we have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel 

to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions in the past and may do so in the future various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain particularly given our geographically dispersed organization in addition we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify or execute new acquisition opportunities in the future 

divestures of any of our businesses or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we continually evaluate the performance of our businesses and may determine to sell a business or product line while we believe these divestures are in the best interests of our longterm strategy they may result in significant writeoffs or impairments of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for example we completed the sale of certain of our assets and liabilities associated with a product line in our rbis segment in may 2015 at a loss and incurred impairment charges as well as exit costs including costs associated with severance payments any future divestitures we undertake may also involve additional risks including separation of operations products and personnel diversion of management attention 

disruption to our other businesses and loss of key employees we may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront in divesting a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect certain accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation there can be no assurance that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

we are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes in addition tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years including recent actions by the european commission related to disallowed state aid with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at the time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our future results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

potential tax liabilities and proposed changes in us tax legislation could materially impact our business 

in 2015 approximately 74 of our sales were generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees were located outside of the us while we are taxed by local authorities on earnings from these sales we have not accrued us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on unrepatriated earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because we intend to indefinitely reinvest in the operations of those subsidiaries our results of operations and cash flows from 

operating activities may be materially adversely affected if tax rules regarding unrepatriated earnings change if changes in our domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings for which no tax provisions have been made or if the us international tax rules change as part of comprehensive tax reform or other tax legislation 

significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of risks including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses social engineering phishing or other malicious attacks and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions we have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer  

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form which is stored in data centers and on our networks and thirdparty cloud services including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions additionally we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised 

any such breach or attack could compromise our network the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential proprietary or personal information a data center where we have stored such information or a thirdparty cloud service provider and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation impair our ability to conduct business or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property contractual provisions with third parties including cloud service providers may limit our ability to recover these losses if personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or morale and we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident 

from time to time we have experienced unauthorized intrusions into our network and although these intrusions did not have a material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case going forward following these attacks we have taken additional steps designed to improve the security of our networks and computer systems despite these defensive measures there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information in data centers and on the cloud are taking similar precautions or that we will not continue to experience future intrusions 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees in particular due to expansion to additional geographies and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highlyskilled employees if we do not offer marketcompetitive employment and compensation terms if we fail to recruit or retain our key management or sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy 

executive succession planning is also important to our longterm success for example we experienced several recent key management changes including the appointments of a chief operating officer during 2014 and a new chief financial officer during 2015 while we believe we have appropriate succession procedures in place any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving any of our key management or other highlyskilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses andor increase costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing relationships if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

our share price may be volatile 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which has at times experienced and may in the future experience substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors as well as market expectations of our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially adversely affect our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not be volatile in the future 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the 

interest rates paid a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings below our current levels could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited and we were required to obtain shortterm funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2015 our average variablerate borrowings were approximately 175 million increases in shortterm interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay an assumed 40 basis point move in interest rates affecting our variablerate borrowings 10 of our weightedaverage interest rate on floating rate debt would have increased interest expense by approximately 7 million on variablerate borrowings in 2015 fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in response to the last global economic recession extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment however in december 2015 the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point for the first time since 2006 while it is unclear whether this action suggests a change in previous monetary policy positions including but not limited to an elimination of quantitative easing over time any such change or market expectation of such change may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates such a transition may be abrupt and may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact the market price of our common stock 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness incur certain liens on our assets make certain investments sell our assets or merge with third parties and enter into certain transactions we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions these restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our longterm best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business 

additional financings may dilute the holdings of our current shareholders 

in order to provide capital for the operation of our business we may enter into additional financing arrangements these arrangements may involve the issuance of new shares of preferred or common stock convertible debt securities andor warrants any of these issuances could result in a material increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding which would dilute the ownership interests of our existing common shareholders in addition any new securities could contain provisions such as priorities on distributions and voting rights that could materially adversely affect the value of our existing common stock 

the level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

we evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could also be affected by future legislation or regulation 

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolios overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made 

unfavorable developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters could impact us in a materially adverse manner 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters see legal proceedings part i item 3 

in addition the requirements set forth in the conflict mineral rules required us to undertake due diligence efforts that are expected to continue into the future we expect to continue incurring costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of these verification activities we have identified products in certain businesses in our rbis 

and vancive segments that include metals and minerals subject to the conflict mineral rules our due diligence efforts to verify the origins of these metals and minerals are ongoing our reputation may be harmed if we are not able to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals and metals used in our products 

there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdoms bribery act of 2010 if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including regulatory fines monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers in addition if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties 

we are required to comply with global environmental health and safety laws the costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business 

we are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us and abroad including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business environmental and product content and product safety laws and regulations can be complex and change often we have accrued liabilities for the environmental cleanup of certain sites including sites for which us governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see legal proceedings part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets 

certain of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception if we fail to comply with export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions or other laws we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties including economic sanctions against us incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

furthermore export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons while we train our employees to comply with these regulations we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur a prohibited shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties fines civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we were held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation general liability and environmental liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may materially adversely impact our business we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our business 

healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

during 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 together the aca were signed into law in the us certain of the provisions that could most significantly increase our healthcare costs in the near term include the removal of annual plan limits the changes in rules regarding eligibility for dependents and the mandate that health plans cover 100 of preventative care in addition our healthcare costs could increase if we are required to cover more employees than we do currently or pay penalty amounts in the event that employees do not elect our offered coverage the complexities and ramifications of the aca are significant and being implemented through a phased approach that is expected to continue over the next several years 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels for example since its enactment there have been several changes to the aca and the law is likely to continue to evolve during the course of its implementation as a result the effects of health care reform and the resulting impact on our operations are not fully known any changes to our healthcare cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of january 2 2016 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination no settlement of our liability related to any of the sites has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at these sites and anticipate that our share of remediation costs will be determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with the epa or other governmental authorities 

we have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated these estimates could change as a result of changes in planned remedial actions remediation technologies site conditions the estimated time to complete remediation environmental laws and regulations and other factors because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expenses to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably 

estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly in addition we may be identified as a prp at additional sites in the future the range of expenses for remediation of any futureidentified sites would be addressed as they arise until then a range of expenses for such remediation cannot be determined 

as of january 2 2016 our estimated accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was 177 million 

in addition we are involved in various lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters most of which are routine to the nature of our business we have accrued liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation future expenses to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly additional lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future the range of expenses for resolving any future matters would be assessed as they arise until then a range of potential expenses for such resolution cannot be determined based upon current information we believe that the impact of the resolution of these matters would not be individually or in the aggregate material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

business overview and reportable segments 

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are sold to label printers and converters that convert the materials into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting some are sold by us in converted form as tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of other converted products and items not involving pressuresensitive components such as fasteners tickets tags radiofrequency identification rfid inlays and tags and imprinting equipment and related services which we market to retailers and apparel manufacturers and brand owners 

our reportable segments in 2014 were 

• pressuresensitive materials psm • retail branding and information solutions rbis and • vancive medical technologies™ vancive in 2014 the psm and rbis segments contributed approximately 74 and 25 respectively of our total sales 

in 2014 international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business representing approximately 76 of our sales as of january 3 2015 we operated approximately 180 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide employed over 25000 persons and had operations in over 50 countries 

on july 1 2013 we completed the sale our office and consumer products ocp and designed and engineered solutions des businesses to ccl industries inc we continue to be subject to indemnification obligations including for breaches of certain representations warranties and covenants under the terms of the purchase agreement in addition the tax liability associated with the sale is subject to completion of tax return filings in the jurisdictions where we operated the ocp and des businesses the ocp and des businesses are reported as discontinued operations in this form 10k 

pressuresensitive materials segment 

our psm segment manufactures and sells fasson® jac® and avery dennison®brand pressuresensitive label and packaging materials avery dennison®brand graphics avery dennison®brand reflective products avery dennison®brand tapes and performance polymers largely used to manufacture pressuresensitive materials the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products and operations in europe pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with companydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with specially coated backing papers and films they are sold 

in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings and are available in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties these label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label printers and converters for labeling decorating fastening electronic data processing and special applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four layers a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

because selfadhesive materials are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation the use of selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared with other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials are also used to convey a variety of variable information such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly every size shape and color our graphics and reflective products include a variety of films and other products that are sold to the architectural commercial sign digital printing and other related market segments we also sell durable cast and reflective films to the construction automotive and fleet transportation market segments and reflective films for traffic and safety applications we provide sign shops commercial printers and designers a broad range of pressuresensitive materials to enable the creation of impactful and informative brand and decorative graphics we have an array of pressuresensitive vinyl and specialty materials designed for digital imaging screen printing and sign cutting applications

research and development 

many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with customers these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid in our rbis segment and medical technologies in vancive for both of which we hold and license a number of patents 

our expenses for research and development were 1026 million in 2014 96 million in 2013 and 986 million in 2012 

patents trademarks and licenses 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery dennison our logo and fasson we believe these trademarks are strong in the market segments in which our products compete 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources which are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors and risks discussed below as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated herein by reference could materially adversely 

affect our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline the risks described below are not exhaustive our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2014 approximately 76 of our sales were from international operations we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign earnings and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

a decline in economic activity in the us and other regions of the world could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the recent decline in the value of the euro declines in economic conditions in the us europe and asia could materially adversely affect our customers suppliers and businesses similar to ours these declines could result in a variety of negative effects including lower revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles a decline in economic conditions such as the recent macroeconomic challenges in the us and europe the slowdown in the growth of the chinese economy and the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union or business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political social or economic instability and unrest such as the ongoing significant civil political and economic disturbances in russia ukraine and the surrounding areas could also have other material adverse effects on our business the current political situation in ukraine the sanctions imposed against russia by certain european nations and the us and russias response to these sanctions may further increase the economic uncertainty in the affected regions and lead to further fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies used in these regions such as the euro and the ruble in addition uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets could cause volatility and disruption in the global and us economies which could materially adversely impact our business including the availability and cost of supplies and materials and our ability to obtain financing at reasonable costs we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share or reduce selling prices materially adversely affecting our business 

we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key market segments and implement new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

we also are at risk with regard to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customers ability to achieve incentive goals changes in customers preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or pass on raw material and labor costs raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business 

the pricing environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile additionally energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and could recur in addition rules adopted by the sec pursuant to section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure concerning the use of certain minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries conflict mineral rules in an effort to minimize adverse disclosures we could make alternative sourcing and supply decisions for materials used in certain of our products which could materially adversely affect our pricing terms particularly if suppliers incur significant additional costs and expenses in making the determinations required to support this disclosure or if the number of suppliers offering minerals identified as conflict free is limited our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on cost increases for raw materials to customers by raising the selling prices for our products and our ability to improve productivity depending on market dynamics and the terms of customer contracts our ability to recover these costs by increasing prices may be limited also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers it is possible that any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters or other events or be terminated in the future a disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

because our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties 

our products are not sold only by us but by thirdparty distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also occasionally use thirdparty manufacturers for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction deficiencies in the performance of outsourced manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our operations and activities outside of the us may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations  

a substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the us and for the year ended january 3 2015 approximately 76 of our sales were generated from customers located outside of the us international operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors suppliers distributors and customers in certain of these markets changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including nationally regionally and locally challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to sales corporate governance operations taxes employment and legal proceedings establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and to monitor compliance with us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations 

including the united kingdoms bribery act of 2010 materially adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings differences in lending practices challenges of complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations and differences in languages cultures and time zones 

the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation sales and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations in addition product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our financial results or reputation 

there are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds and loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands we also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as our business environment changes we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses when these changes occur we may incur costs to change our business strategies and may need to write down the value of certain assets we also may need to invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain if any of these events were to occur our costs could increase our assets could be impaired and our returns on investments could be lower 

our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions civil unrest economic volatility and other risks applicable to international operations 

an increasing percentage of our sales are derived from emerging markets including countries in asia latin america and eastern europe the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our longterm growth strategy if we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries our financial performance could be materially adversely affected in addition to the risks applicable to our international operations factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these developing and emerging markets include the lack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions civil unrest or economic volatility these factors could result in decreased consumer purchasing power reduced demand for our products or an impaired ability to achieve our longterm growth strategy thereby having a material adverse effect on our business 

our inability to develop and successfully market new products and applications could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development is complex and uncertain requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that could compromise our competitive position 

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

projected infrastructure investment requirements may differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we anticipate our infrastructure investments generally are longterm in nature and it is possible that these investments may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete implementation and other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business 

our future profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in our operations which may include facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may materially adversely affect our business 

with approximately 76 of our sales for the fiscal year ending january 3 2015 arising from foreign sales we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies which can cause transaction translation and other losses and could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to changes in foreign currencies hedging activities may only offset a portion of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

additionally concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies potentially dislocating the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces its local currency could be significantly devalued and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected given the introduction of additional currencies furthermore if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars 

we have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel 

to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions in the past and may do so in the future various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain particularly given our geographically dispersed organization in addition we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired 

company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future 

divestures of any of our businesses or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we continually evaluate the performance of our businesses and may determine to sell a business or product line for example we completed the sale of our ocp and des businesses in 2013 divestures may result in significant writeoffs or impairments of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets divestitures may involve additional risks including separation of operations products and personnel diversion of management attention disruption to our other businesses and loss of key employees we may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront in divesting a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect certain accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation there can be no assurance that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at the time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our future results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

potential tax liabilities and proposed changes in us tax legislation could materially impact our business 

in 2014 approximately 76 of our sales were generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees were located outside of the us we have not accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on unrepatriated earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because we intend to indefinitely reinvest in the operations of those subsidiaries our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities may be materially adversely affected if tax rules regarding unrepatriated earnings change if changes in our domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings for which no tax provisions have been made or if the us international tax rules change as part of comprehensive tax reform or other tax legislation 

significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of risks including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses social engineering phishing or other malicious attacks and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions we have implemented certain measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer  

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form which is stored in data centers and on our networks and thirdparty cloud services including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions additionally we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised 

any such breach or attack could compromise our network the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential proprietary or personal information a data center where we have stored such information or a thirdparty cloud service provider and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation impair our ability to conduct business or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property contractual provisions with third parties including 

cloud service providers may limit our ability to recover these losses if personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or morale and we could incur costs to compensate our customers and employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident 

from time to time we have experienced unauthorized intrusions into our network and although these intrusions did not have a material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case going forward following these attacks we have taken additional steps designed to improve the security of our networks and computer systems despite these defensive measures there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information in data centers and on the cloud are taking similar precautions or that we will not continue to experience future intrusions 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to expansion to additional geographies and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees if we fail to retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses andor increase costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing relationships if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

our share price may be volatile 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which has at times experienced substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors as well as market expectations of our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially adversely affect our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not be volatile in the future 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings below our current levels could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited and we were required to obtain shortterm funding 

under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2014 our average variable rate borrowings were approximately 203 million increases in shortterm interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay an assumed 50 basis point move in interest rates affecting our variablerate borrowings 10 of our weightedaverage interest rate on floating rate debt would have increased interest expense by approximately 1 million on variable rate borrowings in 2014 fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 

in recent years extraordinary monetary policy actions of the us federal reserve and other central banking institutions including the utilization of quantitative easing were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment changes in these monetary policy positions including but not limited to an elimination of quantitative easing over time or market expectation of such changes may result in significantly higher longterm interest rates the transition to which may be abrupt such a transition may among other things reduce the availability andor increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact the market price of our common stock 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness incur certain liens on our assets make certain investments sell our assets or merge with third parties and enter into certain transactions we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions these restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our longterm best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business 

additional financings may dilute the holdings of our current shareholders 

in order to provide capital for the operation of our business we may enter into additional financing arrangements these arrangements may involve the issuance of new shares of preferred or common stock convertible debt securities andor warrants any of these issuances could result in a material increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding which would dilute the ownership interests of existing common shareholders in addition any new securities could contain provisions such as priorities on distributions and voting rights that could materially adversely affect the value of our existing common stock 

the level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

we evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we 

use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could also be affected by future legislation or regulation 

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolios overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods of such charges 

unfavorable developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including those involving product and trade compliance and other matters could impact us in a materially adverse manner 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including but not limited to product and trade compliance and other matters see legal proceedings part i item 3 

in addition the requirements set forth in the conflict mineral rules required us to undertake due diligence efforts commencing in 2013 continuing through 2014 and expected to continue into the future we expect to continue incurring costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we have identified products in certain businesses in our rbis and vancive segments that include metals and minerals subject to the conflict mineral rules our due diligence efforts to verify the origins of these metals and minerals are ongoing our reputation may be harmed if we are not able to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals and metals used in our products 

there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdoms bribery act of 2010 if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including regulatory fines monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers in addition if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties 

we are required to comply with global environmental health and safety laws the costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business 

we are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us and abroad including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and have material adverse effect on our business environmental and product content and product safety laws and regulations can be complex and change often we have accrued liabilities for the environmental cleanup of certain sites including sites for which us governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see legal proceedings part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets 

certain of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception if we fail to comply with export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions or other laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including economic sanctions against us incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

furthermore export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons while we train our employees to comply with these regulations we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur a prohibited shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations penalties fines civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we were held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious and the development of new technology could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation general liability and environmental liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may materially adversely impact our business we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our business 

healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

during 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law in the us certain of the provisions that could most significantly increase our healthcare costs in the near term include the removal of annual plan limits the changes in rules regarding eligibility for dependents and the mandate that health plans cover 100 of preventative care in addition our healthcare costs could increase if we are required to cover more employees than we do currently or pay penalty amounts in the event that employees do not elect our offered coverage the complexities and ramifications of the new legislation are significant and have begun being implemented through a phased approach that is expected to conclude in 2018 at this time the effects of health care reform and the resulting impact on our operations are not fully known changes to our healthcare cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of january 3 2015 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed we are participating with other prps at such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

we have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expenses to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities accrued by us however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate the range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly in addition we could identify additional sites for cleanup in the future the range of expenses for remediation of any futureidentified sites will be assessed as they arise until then a range of expenses for such remediation cannot be determined 

as of january 3 2015 our estimated accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was 262 million 

in addition we are involved in various lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters most of which are routine to the nature of our business we have accrued liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation future expenses to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate the range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we would adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly additional lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future the range of expenses for resolving any future matters will be assessed as they arise until then a range of potential expenses for such resolution cannot be determined based upon current information we believe that the impact of the resolution of these matters would not be individually or in the aggregate material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

business overview and reportable segments 

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are sold to label printers and converters that convert the materials into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting some are sold by us in converted form as tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of other converted products and items not involving pressuresensitive components such as fasteners tickets tags radiofrequency identification rfid inlays and tags and imprinting equipment and related services which we market to retailers and apparel manufacturers and brand owners 

our reportable segments in 2013 were 

• pressuresensitive materials psm and • retail branding and information solutions rbis in addition to our reportable segments our other specialty converting businesses category is comprised of vancive medical technologies™ vancive a producer of medical products and solutions 

on january 29 2013 we entered into an agreement to sell our office and consumer products ocp and designed and engineered solutions des businesses to ccl industries inc ccl for a total purchase price of 500 million on july 1 2013 we completed the sale and entered into an amendment to the purchase agreement which among other things increased the target net working capital amount and amended provisions related to employee matters and indemnification we continue to be subject to indemnification provisions including for breaches of certain representations warranties and covenants under the terms of the purchase agreement in addition the tax liability associated with the sale is subject to completion of tax return filings in the jurisdictions where the ocp and des businesses operated the ocp and des businesses are reported as discontinued operations in this form 10k prior to this divestiture the ocp business was reported as a reportable segment and the des business was included in our other specialty converting businesses 

in 2013 the psm and rbis segments contributed approximately 73 and 26 of our total sales respectively 

in 2013 international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business representing approximately 75 of our sales as of december 28 2013 we operated approximately 180 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide employed approximately 26000 persons and had operations in over 50 countries 

pressuresensitive materials segment 

our psm segment manufactures and sells fasson® jac® and avery dennison®brand pressuresensitive label and packaging materials avery dennison®brand graphics and graphic films avery dennison®brand reflective products avery dennison®brand tapes and performance polymers largely used to manufacture pressuresensitive materials the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products and operations in europe pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with companydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with specially coated backing papers and films they are sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings and are available in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties these label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label printers and converters for labeling decorating fastening electronic data processing and special applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four layers a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

because selfadhesive materials are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation the use of selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared with other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials helps foster increased sales of the product on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials are also used to convey a variety of variable information such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly every size shape and color 

our graphics and reflective businesses sell a variety of films and other products to the architectural commercial sign digital printing and other related market segments we also sell durable cast and reflective films to the construction automotive and fleet transportation market segments and reflective films for traffic and safety applications we provide sign shops commercial printers and designers a broad range of pressuresensitive materials to enable the creation of impactful and informative brand and decorative graphics we have an array of pressuresensitive vinyl and specialty materials designed for digital imaging screen printing and sign cutting applications

competitors into the field of pressuresensitive adhesives and materials is limited by technical knowledge and capital requirements we believe that our technical expertise relative size and scale of operations ability to serve our customers with a broad line of quality products and service programs distribution and brand strength and development and commercialization of new products are among the more significant advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position 

retail branding and information solutions segment 

our rbis segment designs manufactures and sells a wide variety of branding and information solutions to retailers brand owners apparel manufacturers distributors and industrial customers on a global basis the business of this segment tends to be seasonal with higher volume generally in advance of the spring fall backtoschool and holiday shipping periods

research and development 

many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with customers these efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries additionally we focus on research projects related to rfid in our rbis segment and medical technologies in vancive for both of which we hold and license a number of patents 

our expenses for research and development were 96 million in 2013 986 million in 2012 and 938 million in 2011 

patents trademarks and licenses 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery dennison our logo and fasson we believe these trademarks are significantly strong in the market segments in which our products compete 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources which are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below are not exhaustive should these risks actually occur our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2013 approximately 75 of our sales were from international operations we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

a decline in economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world could result in a material adverse effect on our business including among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability significant volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates declines in economic conditions in the united states europe and asia could adversely affect our customers suppliers and businesses similar to ours these declines could result in a variety of negative effects including lower revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles a decline in economic conditions including the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the united states and europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union could also have other material adverse effects on our business in addition uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets and widespread financial and business disruptions caused by any future us government shutdown or default by the us on us government obligations could cause significant volatility and disruption in the global and us economies which could adversely impact our business including the availability and cost of supplies and materials and our ability to obtain financing at reasonable costs we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share or reduce selling prices adversely affecting our business 

we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key market segments and implement new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

we also are at risk with regard to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customers ability to achieve incentive goals changes in customers preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor raw material cost increases could adversely affect our business 

the pricing environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile additionally energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past most recently in 2010 and 2011 and could recur in addition rules adopted by the sec pursuant to section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure concerning the use of certain minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries conflict mineral rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products particularly if the number of suppliers offering the minerals identified as conflict free is limited our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on cost increases for raw materials to customers by raising the selling prices for our products and improving productivity depending on market dynamics and the terms of customer contracts our ability to recover these costs through increased pricing may be limited also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers it is possible that any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters or other events or be terminated in the future a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our future profitability may be adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations including through facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation however the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect our business 

fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction translation and other losses which could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially and adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to changes in foreign currencies hedging activities may only offset a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

additionally concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies potentially dislocating the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces its local currency could be significantly devalued and the demand and pricing strategy for our products could be adversely impacted given the introduction of additional currencies furthermore if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars 

we have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel 

to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions in the past and may do so in the future various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain particularly given our geographically dispersed organization in addition we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future 

divestures of any of our businesses or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we continually evaluate the performance of our businesses and may determine to sell a business or product line for example we completed the sale of our ocp and des businesses in 2013 divestures may result in significant writeoffs or impairments of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets divestitures may involve additional risks including separation of operations products and personnel diversion of management attention disruption to our other businesses and loss of key employees we may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront in divesting a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

increased difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect certain accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our inability to develop and successfully market new products and applications could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or launch of new products that could compromise our competitive position 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation general liability and environmental liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our business we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation there can be no assurance that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially impact our effective tax rate andor have a material effect on our business 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our future results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

potential tax liabilities and proposed changes in us tax legislation could materially impact our business 

currently approximately 75 of our sales are generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and our employees are located outside of the us we have not accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on unrepatriated earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because we intend to indefinitely reinvest in the operations of those subsidiaries our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities may be materially and adversely affected if tax rules regarding unrepatriated earnings change if changes in our domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings for which no tax provisions have been made or if the us international tax rules change as part of comprehensive tax reform or other tax legislation 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to expansion in certain markets and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our businesses andor increased costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing strategies if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively and in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of factors including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses social engineering phishing or other malicious attacks and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions we have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs 

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees in digital form data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely in addition we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised if our data systems were compromised our ability to conduct business could be impaired we could lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities could be diminished and we could lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property if personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or morale and we could incur costs to compensate our customers and employees or pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident 

additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation which makes our operations vulnerable to these vendors failures to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our business 

projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we anticipate our infrastructure investments generally are long term in nature and it is possible that these investments may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete implementation or other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our business 

our reputation sales and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 

there are occasions when we manufacture products with quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds and loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues could adversely impact our business and negatively impact our reputation 

because our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties 

our products are not sold only by us but by thirdparty distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our business 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also occasionally use thirdparty manufacturers for example for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction deficiencies in the performance of outsourced manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses when these changes occur we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of selected assets we also may need to invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain if any of these events were to occur our costs could increase our assets could be impaired or our returns on new investments could be lower than prior to the change in strategy 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid a downgrade of our shortterm credit ratings below our current levels could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities would be available to meet our shortterm funding requirements if necessary at december 28 2013 our variable rate borrowings were 739 million fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse impact on our business 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain and any future indebtedness of ours likely would contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us the restrictive covenants in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely 

affect our ability to engage in certain business activities that may otherwise be in our best longterm interests 

additional financings may dilute the holdings of our current shareholders 

in order to provide capital for the operation of our business we may enter into additional financing arrangements these arrangements may involve the issuance of new shares of preferred or common stock convertible debt securities andor warrants any of these issuances could result in a material increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding which would dilute the ownership interests of existing common shareholders in addition any new securities could contain provisions such as priorities on distributions and voting rights that could materially and adversely affect the value of our existing common stock 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

we evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant government regulations future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could also be affected by future legislation or regulation 

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolios overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline 

our share price may be volatile 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which has at times experienced substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors as well as market expectations for our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially impact our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not be volatile in the future 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates 

and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods of such charges 

adverse developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including those involving product and trade compliance and other matters could impact us materially 

our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including but not limited to product and trade compliance and other matters see legal proceedings part i item 3 

in addition the new requirements set forth in the conflict mineral rules required us to undertake due diligence efforts commencing in 2013 that we expect to continue in 2014 with initial disclosure requirements beginning in may 2014 we expect to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we have identified products in certain businesses in our rbis segment and our other specialty converting businesses that include metals and minerals subject to the conflict mineral rules our due diligence efforts to verify the origins of these metals and minerals are ongoing our reputation may be harmed if we are not able to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement 

there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

we are required to comply with numerous environmental health and safety laws the costs of complying with these laws could adversely impact our business 

due to the nature of our business we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and generally impact our business we have accrued liabilities for the environmental cleanup of certain sites including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see legal proceedings part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the united 

kingdoms bribery act of 2010 due to the international nature of our business our failure to comply with these rules and regulations could expose us to liabilities 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we were held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious and the development of new technology could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for patents as appropriate we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse impact on our business 

during 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law in the united states certain of the provisions that could most significantly increase our healthcare costs in the near term include the removal of annual plan limits the changes in rules regarding eligibility for dependents and the mandate that health plans cover 100 of preventative care in addition our healthcare costs could increase if the new legislation and accompanying regulations require us to cover more employees than we do currently or pay penalty amounts in the event that employees do not elect our offered coverage much of the cost of the enacted healthcare legislation is expected to occur in or after 2014 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time and changes to our healthcare cost structure could have a material adverse impact on our business

we own all of the principal properties identified above except for the facilities in vinhedo brazil glendale california panyu and shenzen china sprockhovel germany rodange luxembourg westborough massachusetts greensboro north carolina and mentor ohio which are leased 

we consider all our properties whether owned or leased suitable and adequate for our present needs we generally expand production capacity as needed to meet increased demand owned buildings and plant equipment are insured against major losses from fire and other usual business risks subject to deductibles we are not aware of any material defects in title to or significant encumbrances on our properties except for certain mortgage liens 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 28 2013 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at ten waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed we are participating with other prps at such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

we have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expenses to remediate these sites could be higher than the 

liabilities accrued by us however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information becomes available that allows us to reasonably estimate the range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we will adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly in addition we could identify additional sites for cleanup in the future the range of expenses for remediation of any futureidentified sites will be assessed as they arise until then a range of expenses for such remediation cannot be determined 

as of december 28 2013 our estimated accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was 296 million 

in addition we are involved in various lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters most of which are routine to the nature of our business we have accrued liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation future expenses to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information becomes available that allows us to reasonably estimate the range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly additional lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future the range of expenses for resolving any future matters will be assessed as they arise until then a range of potential expenses for such resolution cannot be determined based upon current information we believe that the impact of the resolution of these matters would not be individually or in the aggregate material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

our reportable segments in 2012 were 

• pressuresensitive materials and • retail branding and information solutions in the fourth quarter of 2012 we realigned our segment reporting to reflect a new operating structure this included the consolidation of certain operations the streamlining of our corporate organization and the realignment of organizational structures and accountabilities these actions were reflected in the movement of performance tapes and rfid inlay manufacturing businesses from other specialty converting businesses into our reportable segments our performance tapes business is now included in the pressuresensitive materials psm segment and our rfid inlay manufacturing business is now included in the retail branding and information solutions rbis segment in addition we adopted a new corporate expense allocation methodology whereby the allocation of corporate costs to the segments and other businesses was refined to better reflect costs required to support their respective operations under the new methodology costs for which i a significant portion of the benefit derived from activity directly relates to operating unit performance and ii the level of resourcing is impacted by operating unit decisions are fully allocated to operations all prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect these changes 

in addition to our reportable segments we have other specialty converting businesses comprised of vancive medical technologies™ vancive and designed and engineered solutions des 

in 2011 we entered into an agreement to sell our office and consumer products ocp business to 3m company 3m on october 3 2012 we and 3m mutually agreed to terminate the agreement on january 29 2013 we entered into an agreement to sell our ocp and des businesses to ccl industries inc ccl for a total purchase price of 500 million in cash subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the agreement the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close in mid2013 the operating results of the des business 

reported in our other specialty converting businesses for all periods presented in this form 10k are expected to be classified as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of 2013 the ocp business is reported as discontinued operations in this form 10k 

in 2012 the psm and rbis segments contributed approximately 71 and 25 of our total sales respectively 

in 2012 international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business representing approximately 72 of our sales as of december 29 2012 we operated approximately 200 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide employed approximately 30000 persons and had operations in over 50 countries 

pressuresensitive materials segment 

our psm segment manufactures and sells fasson® jac® and avery dennison®brand pressuresensitive label and packaging materials avery® and avery dennison®brand graphics and graphic films avery dennison®brand reflective products avery dennison®brand tapes and performance polymers largely used to manufacture pressuresensitive materials the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products and operations in europe pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with companydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with specially coated backing papers and films they are sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings and are available in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties these label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label printers and converters for labeling decorating fastening electronic data processing and special applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

because selfadhesive materials are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation the use of selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared with other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials helps foster increased sales of the product on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape and color

research and development 

many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with customers these efforts also include patent and product development work and focus on improving adhesives materials and coating processes as well as 

related product applications and ventures in addition these efforts often focus on projects relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries 

our expenses for research and development were 1051 million in 2012 962 million in 2011 and 884 million in 2010 

patents trademarks and licenses 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery dennison our logo fasson and avery we believe these trademarks are significantly strong in the market segments in which our products compete 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources which are subject to price fluctuations although shortages can occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled could be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described above are not exhaustive if any of the above risks actually occur our business including our results of operations cash flows and financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2012 approximately 72 of our sales were from international operations we have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

a decline in economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world could result in a material adverse effect on our business including among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability significant volatility in securities prices credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates declines in economic conditions in the united states europe and asia could adversely affect our customers suppliers and businesses similar to ours these declines could result in a variety of negative effects including lower revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles a decline in economic conditions including the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the united states and europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union could also have other material adverse effects on our business we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share or reduce selling prices adversely affecting our business 

we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key market segments and implement new technologies enhancing their competitive position relative to ours competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

we also are at risk with regard to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customers ability to achieve incentive goals changes in customers preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor raw material cost increases could adversely affect our business 

the pricing environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile additionally energy costs remain volatile and unpredictable inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past most recently in 2010 and 2011 and could recur in addition rules adopted by the sec pursuant to section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring disclosure concerning the use of certain minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries conflict mineral rules could 

adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products particularly if the number of suppliers offering the minerals identified as conflict free is limited our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on these cost increases to customers by raising the selling prices for our products and by improving productivity depending on market dynamics and the terms of customer contracts our ability to recover these costs through increased pricing may be limited also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers it is possible that any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters or other events or be terminated in the future a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our future profitability may be adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations including through facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation however the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk loss of sales and employee turnover 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect our reported sales and profitability 

fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction translation and other losses which could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially and adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to changes in foreign currencies hedging activities may only offset a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

additionally there are ongoing concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for a variety of individual countries these concerns could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies which could lead to the dislocation or dissolution of the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces its local currency could be significantly devalued furthermore the dislocation or dissolution of the euro could cause significant volatility and disruption in the global economy which could adversely impact our business including the availability and cost of supplies and materials the demand and pricing strategy for our products given the introduction of additional currencies and our ability to obtain financing at reasonable costs finally if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars 

there can be no assurances that we will be able to divest the ocp and des businesses 

although we have entered into an agreement to sell the ocp and des businesses there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete the divestiture transaction in a timely manner or at all which could adversely affect our business delays in segregating these businesses or failure to obtain regulatory approvals or satisfy other closing requirements could result in substantial additional costs or could unfavorably affect the ultimate value of the sale in addition we may be unable to realize any economic or tax benefits from the transaction which could unfavorably affect the ultimate value of the sale if a sale is consummated the provision of transition services may disrupt our ongoing business distract management divert resources and create challenges in maintaining our current customer service levels we may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront in divesting these businesses which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel 

to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions in the past and may do so in the future various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain particularly given our geographically dispersed organization in addition we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future 

divestures of any of our businesses or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we continually evaluate the performance of our businesses and may determine to sell a business or product line divestures may result in significant writeoffs or impairments of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets divestitures may involve additional risks including separation of operations products and personnel diversion of management attention disruption to our other businesses and loss of key employees we may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront in divesting a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our customer base is diversified but in a portion of our business industry concentration has increased the importance and decreased the number of significant customers 

sales of our ocp business in the united states are concentrated in a few major customers principally office product superstores mass market distributors and wholesalers if we are unable to divest this business the business risk associated with this concentration including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt writeoffs could negatively affect the businesss margins and profits 

possible increased difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect certain accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our inability to develop and successfully market new products and applications could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or launch of new products that could compromise our competitive position 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation general liability and environmental liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our business we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially impact our effective tax rate andor our financial results 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our future results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either a favorable or an unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

potential tax liabilities and proposed changes in us tax legislation could materially impact our business 

currently the majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and our employees are located outside of the us we have not accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on unrepatriated earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities may be materially and adversely affected if tax rules regarding unrepatriated earnings change if changes in our domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings for which no tax provisions have been made or if the u s international tax rules change as part of comprehensive tax reform or other tax legislation 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to expansion in certain markets and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees 

in addition we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our businesses andor increased costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing strategies if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively and in a timely manner or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of factors including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions we have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs 

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees in digital form data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely in addition we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised if our data systems are compromised our ability to conduct business may be impaired we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property if personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or morale and we could incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident 

additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation which may make our operations vulnerable to these vendors failure to perform adequately 

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our business 

projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we anticipate our infrastructure investments generally are longterm in nature and it is possible that these investments may not generate our expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete implementation or other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our business 

our reputation sales and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 

there are occasions when we manufacture products with quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds and loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues could adversely impact our business and negatively impact our reputation 

because our products are sold by third parties our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties 

our products are not sold only by us but by thirdparty distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our business 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also use thirdparty manufacturers for example for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction deficiencies in the performance of outsourced manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses when these changes occur we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of selected assets we also may need to invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain if any of these events were to occur our costs could increase our assets could be impaired or our returns on new investments could be lower than prior to the change in strategy 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs or opportunities and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings if our credit ratings were to be downgraded our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow would increase at december 29 2012 our variable rate borrowings were 2681 million fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse impact on our business 

our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility 

our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us the restrictive covenants in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain business activities that would otherwise be in our best longterm interests 

additional financings may dilute the holdings of our current shareholders 

in order to provide capital for the operation of our business we may enter into additional financing arrangements these arrangements may involve the issuance of new shares of preferred or common stock convertible debt securities andor warrants any of these items could result in a material increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding which would in turn result in a dilution of the ownership interests of existing common shareholders in addition these new securities could contain provisions such as priorities on distributions and voting rights that could affect the value of our existing common stock 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we were to determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant government regulations for each plan future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by future legislation or regulation 

our pension assets are significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolios overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline 

our share price may be volatile 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which has at times experienced substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors and market expectations for our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially impact our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will be less volatile in the future 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present we review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value in assessing fair value we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit 

we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses resulted in a significant goodwill impairment charge in 2009 related to our rbis segment and could result in other goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods of such charges as did the one in 2009 

potential adverse developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including those involving product and trade compliance and other matters could impact us materially 

our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including but not limited to product and trade compliance and other matters see legal proceedings part i item 3 for example the new requirements set forth in the conflict mineral rules will require due diligence efforts during 2013 with initial disclosure requirements beginning in may 2014 we expect to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities our reputation may be harmed if we are not able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement 

there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

we need to comply with numerous environmental health and safety laws the costs of complying with these laws could adversely impact our business 

due to the nature of our business we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities limit our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and generally impact our business we have accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup sites including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see legal proceedings part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

we are required to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business 

due to the international nature of our business we are required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various international jurisdictions such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdoms bribery act of 2010 and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations could expose us to liabilities 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we are held liable for 

infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or will be available at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious and the development of new technology could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek patents as appropriate we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse impact on our business 

during 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law in the united states certain of the provisions that could most significantly increase our healthcare costs in the near term include the removal of annual plan limits the changes in rules regarding eligibility for dependents and the mandate that health plans cover 100 of preventative care in addition our healthcare costs could increase if the new legislation and accompanying regulations require us to cover more employees than we do currently or pay penalty amounts in the event that employees do not elect our offered coverage while much of the cost of the enacted healthcare legislation is expected to occur in or after 2014 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time changes to our healthcare cost structure could have a material adverse impact on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 29 2012 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed we are participating with other prps at such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

we have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities accrued by us however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information becomes available that allows us to reasonably estimate the range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we will adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly in addition we could identify additional sites for cleanup in the future the range of expense for remediation of any futureidentified sites will be assessed as they arise until then a range of expense for such remediation cannot be determined 

as of december 29 2012 our estimated accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was 325 million see also note 8 contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements of our 2012 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters most of which are routine to the nature of our business we have accrued liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation future expense to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities accrued by us however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information becomes available that allows us to reasonably estimate the range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we will adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly additional lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future the range of expense for resolving any future matters will be assessed as they arise until then a range of potential expense for such resolution cannot be determined based upon current information management believes that the impact of the resolution of these would not be individually or in the aggregate material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

in 2011 international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business representing approximately 73 of our sales as of december 31 2011 we operated approximately 200 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide employed over 30000 persons and conducted business in over 60 countries 

pressuresensitive materials segment 

our pressuresensitive materials segment manufactures and sells fasson ®  jac ®  and avery dennison ® brand pressuresensitive label and packaging materials avery ®  and avery dennison ® brand graphics and graphic films avery dennison ® brand reflective products and performance polymers largely used to manufacture pressuresensitive materials the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products and operations in western europe pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with companydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with specially coated backing papers and films they are sold in roll or 

  

sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings and are available in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties these label and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label printers and converters for labeling decorating fastening electronic data processing and special applications in the home and personal care beer and beverage durables pharmaceutical wine and spirits and food market segments 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

because selfadhesive materials are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation the use of selfadhesive materials can provide cost savings compared with other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials often helps foster increased sales of the product on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape and color

research and development 

many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our expenses for research design and testing of new products and applications by our operating units and the avery research center located in pasadena california and the philip m neal asia pacific research center in kunshan china the “research centers” were 924 million in 2011 856 million in 2010 and 789 million in 2009 

our operating units’ research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with customers the research centers support our operating units’ patent and product development work and focuses on improving adhesives materials and coating processes as well as related product applications and ventures these efforts often focus on projects relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries 

patents trademarks and licenses 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery fasson avery dennison and our logo we believe these trademarks are significant in the market segments in which our products compete 

manufacturing and environmental matters 

we use various raw materials primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources which are subject to price fluctuations although shortages could occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled would be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in many of our facilities 

  

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we conduct business in over 60 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

changes in economic conditions in the regions in which we conduct business could negatively impact our customers suppliers and business 

a decline in economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world can result in a material adverse effect on our business including among other things reduced consumer spending declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability significant volatility in securities prices rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the most recent declines in economic conditions in the united states europe and asia adversely affected our customers suppliers and businesses similar to ours these declines resulted in a variety of negative effects including reduction in revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles a decline in economic conditions including the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the united states and europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union could also have other material adverse effects on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries and there can be no assurance that there will not be further declines in economic activity 

  

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor raw material cost increases could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the pricing environment for raw materials used in a number of our businesses continues to be challenging and volatile additionally energy costs remain volatile and unpredictable inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past recurred in 2010 and 2011 and are expected to recur our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on these cost increases to customers by raising the selling prices for our products and by effecting productivity improvements depending on market dynamics and the terms of customer contracts our ability to recover these costs through increased pricing may be limited also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers it is possible that any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters or other events or be terminated in the future a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our future profitability may be adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations through facility closures and square footage reductions headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation by using a variety of tools including enterprise lean sigma and kaizen events to increase productivity however the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk and loss of sales 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share and experience falling prices adversely affecting our financial results 

we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key market segments and implement new technologies making them more competitive competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

we also are at risk with regard to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in demand for our products 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect our reported sales and profitability 

in 2011 approximately 73 of our sales were from international operations fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction translation and other losses to us which could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially and adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to changes in foreign currencies hedging activities may only offset a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

additionally there are ongoing concerns regarding the short and longterm stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for a variety of individual countries these concerns could lead individual countries to revert or threaten to revert to their former local currencies which could lead to the dislocation or dissolution of the euro if this were to occur the assets we hold in a country that reintroduces its local currency 

  

could be significantly devalued furthermore the dislocation or dissolution of the euro could cause significant volatility and disruption in the global economy which could adversely impact our financial results including the availability and cost of supplies and materials the demand and pricing strategy for our products given the introduction of additional currencies and our ability to obtain financing at reasonable costs finally if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into us dollars 

we have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel in addition divestures of any of our businesses or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions including our acquisitions of paxar corporation in june 2007 and dm label group in april 2008 and may do so in the future various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain particularly given our geographically dispersed organization in addition we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future 

we continually evaluate the performance of our businesses and may determine to sell a business or product line divestures may result in significant writeoffs or impairments of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets divestitures may involve additional risks including separation of operations products and personnel diversion of management attention disruption to our other businesses and loss of key employees on december 30 2011 we agreed to sell our office and consumer products business to 3m company we may be unable to close the transaction in a timely manner or at all because of delays in carvingout the office and consumer products business or failure to obtain regulatory approvals or satisfy other closing requirements any of which could result in substantial additional costs or could unfavorably affect the ultimate value of the sale in addition we may be unable to realize any accounting or tax benefits from the transaction which could unfavorably affect the ultimate value of the sale the divestiture and provision of transition services may also disrupt our ongoing business distract management divert resources and create challenges in maintaining our current customer service levels business standards controls and procedures we may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront in divesting a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our customer base is diversified but in certain portions of our business industry concentration has increased the importance and decreased the number of significant customers 

sales of our office and consumer products business in the united states are concentrated in a few major customers principally office product superstores mass market distributors and wholesalers the business risk associated with this concentration including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt writeoffs could negatively affect our margins and profits 

possible increased difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material effect on our results from operations and cash provided by operating activities 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer 

  

experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our trade accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

our inability to develop and successfully market new products and applications could compromise our competitive position 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or launch of new products that could compromise our competitive position 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

we have various types of insurance including property workers’ compensation and general liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may materially impact our effective tax rate andor our financial results 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have a material adverse effect on our future operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate the computation and assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations 

proposed changes in us tax legislation could materially impact our financial results 

currently the majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and our employees are located outside of the us we have not accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those 

  

earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain proposals could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to expansion in certain markets and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees 

we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our businesses andor increased costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing strategies if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively and in a timely manner or if we experience problems with a transition we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our operations sales customer relations and financial results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of factors including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions we have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption were to occur we could incur significant losses and remediation costs 

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees in digital form data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion tampering and theft we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated moreover despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely and risks associated with each of these remain in addition we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where appropriate assess the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised if our data systems are compromised our ability to conduct business may be impaired we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property if personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or morale and we could incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident 

additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation which may make our operations vulnerable to these third parties’ failure to perform adequately 

  

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our financial results 

projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we anticipate our infrastructure investments generally are long term in nature and it is possible that these investments may not generate our expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete implementation or other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation sales and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 

there are occasions when we manufacture products with quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping thus causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment they may result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds and loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues can result in adverse financial consequences and a negative impact on our reputation 

because our products are sold by third parties our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties 

our products are not sold only by us but by thirdparty distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

we manufacture most of our products but we also use thirdparty manufacturers for example for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction deficiencies in the performance of outsourced manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses when these changes occur we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of selected assets we also may need to invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain in any of these events our costs may increase our assets may be impaired or our returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing 

our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs or opportunities and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings if our credit ratings are downgraded our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow would increase at december 31 2011 our variable rate borrowings were 2256 million fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant government regulations for each plan future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by future legislation or regulation 

the level of our pension assets is significant and subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce its value 

changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows in particular the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolios overall risk profile the value of our investments may nevertheless decline 

our share price may be volatile 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which has at times experienced substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors and market expectations for our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific factors can also materially impact our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will be less volatile in the future 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the carrying value of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses resulted in a significant goodwill impairment charge in 2009 related to our retail branding and information solutions segment and could result in other goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges as did the one in 2009 

  

potential adverse developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including those involving product and trade compliance antibribery and other matters could impact us materially 

our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including but not limited to product and trade compliance and antibribery matters see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we are held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or will be available at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious and the development of new technology could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our profitability 

we have obtained and applied for us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek patents as appropriate we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

we need to comply with numerous environmental health and safety laws the costs of complying with these laws could adversely impact our financial results 

due to the nature of our business we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and generally impact our financial performance we have accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup sites including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse impact on our business 

during 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law in the united states certain of the provisions that could most 

  

significantly increase our healthcare costs in the near term include the removal of annual plan limits the changes in rules regarding eligibility for dependents and the mandate that health plans cover 100 of preventative care in addition our healthcare costs could increase if the new legislation and accompanying regulations require us to cover more employees than we do currently or pay penalty amounts in the event that employees do not elect our offered coverage while much of the cost of the recent healthcare legislation enacted is expected to occur in or after 2014 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time changes to our healthcare cost structure could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating costs 

the risks described above are not exhaustive if any of the above risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend as of december 31 2011 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed we are participating with other prps at such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

we have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities accrued by us however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information becomes available that allows us to reasonably estimate the range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we will adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly in addition we could identify additional sites for cleanup in the future the range of expense for remediation of any futureidentified sites will be assessed as they arise until then a range of expense for such remediation cannot be determined 

as of december 31 2011 our estimated accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was 406 million see also note 8 “contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements of our 2011 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

we and our subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters most of which are routine to the nature of our business we have accrued liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation future expense to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities accrued by us however we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses if information becomes available that allows us to reasonably estimate the range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued we will adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly additional lawsuits claims inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future the range of expense for resolving any future matters will be assessed as they arise until then a range of potential expense for such resolution cannot be determined based upon current information management believes that the impact of the resolution of these matters is not individually or in the aggregate material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows

business overview and reporting segments 

 

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials office and consumer products and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are sold to label printers and converters that “convert” the materials into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting some are sold by us in converted form as printable media tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of office and consumer products other converted products and items not involving pressuresensitive components such as binders organizing systems markers fasteners business forms as well as tickets tags radiofrequency identification “rfid” inlays and labels and imprinting equipment and related services for retail and apparel manufacturers 

 

we are subject to certain risks described in “risk factors” part i item 1a and “legal proceedings” part i item 3 including those normally attending international and domestic operations such as changes in economic or political conditions in the regions in which we conduct business currency fluctuations exchange control regulations and the effect of international relations and domestic affairs of foreign countries on the conduct of business competitors tax legislation legal proceedings and the availability and pricing of raw materials 

 

no single customer represented 10 or more of our net sales in or trade receivables at year end of 2010 or 2009 however as of january 1 2011 the ten largest customers by net sales and trade receivables represented 12 and 13 respectively and were primarily concentrated in our office and consumer products segment the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis see “critical accounting policies and estimates” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” united states export sales are not a significant part of our business backlog is not considered material in the industries in which we compete 

 

our reporting segments are 

 

  

in addition to our reporting segments we have other specialty converting businesses comprised of several businesses that produce specialty tapes and highly engineered labels including rfid inlays and labels and other converted products 

 

in 2008 we completed the acquisition of dm label group “dm label” a manufacturer of labels tags and tickets for retail and apparel applications including woven labels these operations are included in our retail information services segment see “retail information services segment” below for further information 

  in 2010 the pressuresensitive materials segment contributed approximately 56 of our total sales while the retail information services and office and consumer products segments contributed approximately 23 and 13 respectively of our total sales 

 

in 2010 international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business representing approximately 68 of our sales we expanded our operations focusing particularly on asia latin america and eastern europe as of january 1 2011 we operated approximately 200 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide employed approximately 32000 persons and conducted business in over 60 countries 

 

pressuresensitive materials segment 

 

our pressuresensitive materials segment manufactures and sells fasson jac and avery dennisonbrand pressuresensitive roll materials averybrand graphics and graphic films avery dennisonbrand reflective products and performance polymers largely used to manufacture pressuresensitive materials the business of this segment tends not to be seasonal except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products and operations in western europe pressuresensitive materials consist primarily of papers plastic films metal foils and fabrics which are coated with companydeveloped and purchased adhesives and then laminated with specially coated backing papers and films they are sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings and are available in a wide range of face materials sizes thicknesses and adhesive properties these materials are sold to label printers and converters for labeling decorating fastening electronic data processing and special applications on a worldwide basis 

 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

 

because selfadhesive materials are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation the use of selfadhesive materials often provides cost savings compared with other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials often helps foster increased sales of the product on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape and color

research and development 

 

many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts our expenses for research design and testing of new products and applications by our operating units and the avery research center located in pasadena california the “research center” were 956 million in 2010 907 million in 2009 and 94 million in 2008 

 

our operating units’ research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance often in close association with customers the research center supports our operating units’ patent and product development work and focuses on improving adhesives materials and coating processes as well as related product applications and ventures these efforts often focus on projects relating to printing and coating technologies as well as adhesive release and ink chemistries 

 

patents trademarks and licenses 

 

the loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole nor to our operating segments individually our principal trademarks are avery fasson avery dennison and the company’s symbol we believe these trademarks are significant in the market segments in which our products compete 

  manufacturing and environmental matters 

 

we use various raw materials primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources which are subject to price fluctuations although shortages could occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled would be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in our facilities in peachtree city georgia fort wayne and greenfield indiana painesville ohio and quakertown pennsylvania as well as in other plants in the united states argentina australia belgium brazil china colombia france germany india korea luxembourg malaysia mexico the netherlands south africa thailand and the united kingdom 

 

based on current information we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor raw material cost increases could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

the pricing environment for raw materials used in a number of our businesses continues to be challenging and volatile additionally energy costs remain volatile and unpredictable inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past recurred in 2010 and thus far in 2011 and are expected 

  to recur our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on these cost increases to customers through our selling prices for products and to effect productivity improvements depending on market dynamics and the terms of customer contracts our ability to recover these costs through increased pricing may be limited also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers it is possible that any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters or other events or be terminated in the future a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share and experience falling prices adversely affecting our financial results 

 

we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key market segments and implement new technologies making them more competitive competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

 

we also are at risk with regard to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in our incentive programs or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in demand for our products 

 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

 

we conduct business in over 60 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

 

changes in tax legislation throughout the world could materially impact our results 

 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world in particular proposed us tax legislation could materially impact our results currently the majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us we have not accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain proposals could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

 

changes in economic conditions in the regions in which we conduct business could negatively impact our customers suppliers and business 

 

a decline in economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world can result in adverse effects on our business including among other things reduced consumer spending inflation declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability significant volatility in securities prices rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the most recent declines in economic conditions were experienced in the united states europe and asia and adversely affected our customers suppliers and businesses similar to ours and resulted in a variety of negative effects such as reduction in revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles a decline in economic conditions could also have other material adverse effects on our business results of operations financial condition 

  and cash flows we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries and there can be no assurance that there will not be further declines in economic activity 

 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect our reported sales and profitability 

 

in 2010 approximately 68 of our sales were from international operations fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction translation and other losses to us which could negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially and adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to changes in foreign currencies hedging activities may only offset a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

 

our future profitability may be adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

 

we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations through facility closures headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation by using a variety of tools such as lean sigma and kaizen events to increase productivity however the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk and loss of sales 

 

we have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel in addition divestures of any of our businesses or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions including our acquisitions of paxar corporation in june 2007 and dm label group in april 2008 and may do so in the future various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with the acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines market segments customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain particularly given our geographically dispersed organization in addition we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both before and after the closing of an acquisition our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future 

 

we continually evaluate the performance of our businesses and may determine to sell a business or product line divestures may result in significant writeoffs or impairments of assets including goodwill and other intangible assets divestitures may involve additional risks including separation of operations products and personnel diversion of management attention disruption to our other businesses and loss of key employees we may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront in divesting a business or product line which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our customer base is diversified but in certain portions of our business industry concentration has increased the importance and decreased the number of significant customers 

 

sales of our office and consumer products in the united states are concentrated in a few major customers principally office product superstores mass market distributors and wholesalers the business risk associated with this concentration including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt writeoffs could negatively affect our margins and profits 

  possible increased difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material effect on our results from operations and anticipated cash from operating activities 

 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our trade accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

 

our inability to develop and successfully market new products and applications could compromise our competitive position 

 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or launch of new products that could compromise our competitive position 

 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services and related delays resource availability or errors may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business 

 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to expansion in certain markets and the ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees 

 

we have outsourced certain services to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our businesses andor increased costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing strategies if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively and in a timely manner or if we experience problems with a transition we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may have to experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers 

 

significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our operations sales customer relations and financial results 

 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of factors including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions we have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption occurs we could incur significant losses and remediation costs 

 

additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation which may make our operations vulnerable to these third parties’ failure to perform adequately 

 

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our financial results 

 

projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we anticipate our infrastructure investments generally are long term in nature and it is possible that these investments may not generate our expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete 

  implementation or other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our financial results 

 

our reputation sales and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 

 

there are occasions when we manufacture products with quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping thus causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment it can result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds and loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues can result in adverse financial consequences and a negative impact on our reputation 

 

some of our products are sold by third parties 

 

our products are not sold only by us but by thirdparty distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability 

 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

 

we manufacture most of our products but we also use thirdparty manufacturers for example for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction deficiencies in the performance of outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results 

 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

 

as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may find it otherwise necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses when these changes occur we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of selected assets we also may need to invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain in any of these events our costs may increase our assets may be impaired or our returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy 

 

if our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing from the capital markets 

 

the overall level of indebtedness and our credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs or opportunities and could result in higher financing costs the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings if our credit ratings are downgraded our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow would increase at january 1 2011 our variable rate borrowings were approximately 380 million fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding 

  requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant government regulations for each plan future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental authorities 

 

our share price may be volatile 

 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which has at times experienced substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors and market expectations for our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific events can also impact our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will be less volatile in the future 

 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the carrying value of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses resulted in a significant goodwill impairment charge in 2009 related to our retail information services segment and could result in other goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges as did the one in 2009 

 

potential adverse developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including those involving product and trade compliance foreign corrupt practices act issues and other matters could impact us materially 

 

our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations including but not limited to proceedings or lawsuits related to class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including but not limited to product customs and trade compliance matters see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow 

 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we are held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or will be available at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious and the development of new technology could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management 

  we also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our profitability 

 

we have obtained and applied for some us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek patents as appropriate we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

 

we need to comply with numerous environmental health and safety laws 

 

due to the nature of our business we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and generally impact our financial performance we have accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup sites including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liabilities accrued 

 

healthcare reform legislation could have an impact on our business 

 

during 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law in the united states certain of the provisions that could most significantly increase our healthcare costs in the near term include the removal of annual plan limits the changes in rules regarding eligibility for dependents and the mandate that health plans cover 100 of preventative care in addition our healthcare costs could increase if the new legislation and accompanying regulations require us to cover more employees than we do currently or pay penalty amounts in the event that employees do not elect our offered coverage while much of the cost of the recent healthcare legislation enacted will occur in or after 2014 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time changes to our healthcare cost structure could have an impact on our business and operating costs 

 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

 

we have various types of insurance including property workers’ compensation and general liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these 

  examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

 

our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may impact our effective tax rate andor our financial results 

 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our future operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation 

 

the risks described above are not exclusive if any of the above risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

as of january 1 2011 we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed we are participating with other prps at such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

 

we have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites that could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liabilities accrued

business overview and reporting segments 

 

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials office products and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are sold to label printers and converters that “convert” the materials into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting some are sold by us in converted form as printable media tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of office products and other converted products and other items not involving pressuresensitive components such as binders organizing systems markers fasteners business forms as well as tickets tags radiofrequency identification “rfid” inlays and labels and imprinting equipment for retail and apparel manufacturers 

 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

 

because selfadhesive materials are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation the use of selfadhesive materials often provides cost savings compared with other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives when used in package decoration applications the visual appeal of selfadhesive materials often helps foster increased sales of the product on which the materials are applied selfadhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape and color 

 

we are subject to certain risks referred to in “risk factors” part i item 1a and “legal proceedings” part i item 3 below including those normally attending international and domestic operations such as changes in economic or political conditions currency fluctuations exchange control regulations and the effect of international relations and domestic affairs of foreign countries on the conduct of business legal proceedings and the availability and pricing of raw materials 

 

no single customer represented 10 or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2009 and 2008 however our ten largest customers at year end 2009 represented approximately 13 of trade accounts receivable and consisted of six customers of our office and consumer products segment and four customers of our pressuresensitive materials segment the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis see “critical accounting policies and estimates” of part i item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” united states export sales are not a significant part of our business backlogs are not considered material in the industries in which we compete

other matters 

 

we use various raw materials primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources which are subject to price fluctuations although shortages could occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which can be regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled would be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in our facilities in peachtree city georgia fort wayne and greenfield indiana painesville ohio and quakertown pennsylvania as well as in other plants in the united states argentina australia belgium brazil china colombia france germany india korea luxembourg malaysia mexico the netherlands south africa thailand and the united kingdom

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

 

adverse conditions in the global economy have negatively impacted our customers suppliers and our business 

 

the united states europe and asia have experienced significant declines in economic activity including among other things reduced consumer spending inflation declines in asset valuations diminished liquidity and credit availability significant volatility in securities prices rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these economic developments have adversely affected our customers suppliers and businesses similar to ours and have resulted in a variety of negative effects such as reduction in revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts 

receivable required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles and such developments could have other material adverse effects on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries and there can be no assurance that there will not be further declines in economic activity 

 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

 

we have operations in over 60 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and international trade regulations including tariffs as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products 

 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share and experience falling prices adversely affecting our financial results 

 

we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key markets and implement new technologies making them more competitive competitors also may be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

 

we also are at risk with regard to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in demand for our products 

 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor 

 

inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to recur and our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on these cost increases to customers through our selling prices for products and to effect improvements in productivity also it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and other resources from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect our sales and profitability 

 

approximately 66 of our sales are from international operations fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction translation and other losses to us which can negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially and adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to changes in foreign currencies hedging activities may only offset a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

 

our future results may be affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

 

we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations through facility closures headcount reductions organizational restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation by using a variety of tools such as lean sigma and kaizen events to increase productivity however the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk and loss of sales 

we have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel 

 

to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future for example we acquired dm label and paxar in 2008 and 2007 respectively various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with the acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines markets customers suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain particularly given our geographically dispersed organization in addition we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both prior to and after the closing of a transaction our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention 

 

there can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future 

 

declines or slower growth in key markets could adversely affect our profitability 

 

our business could be negatively impacted by declines or slower growth in key enduse markets our overall performance will be influenced by these markets 

 

our customer base is diversified but in certain portions of our business industry concentration has increased the importance and decreased the number of significant customers 

 

sales of our office and consumer products in the united states are concentrated in a few major customers principally office product superstores mass market distributors and wholesalers the business risk associated with this concentration including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt writeoffs could negatively affect our margins and profits 

 

possible increased difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material effect on our results from operations and anticipated cash from operating activities 

 

although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we have experienced and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable the financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer we may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty if these developments occur our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our trade accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

 

our ability to develop and successfully market new products and applications is important for our business 

 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or launch of new products that could compromise our competitive position in such product markets 

 

for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services 

 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to expansion in certain markets and the ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees 

we have outsourced certain services to multiple thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our businesses andor increased costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing strategies if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively and in a timely manner or if we experience problems with a transition we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may have to experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers 

 

significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our operations sales customer relations and financial results 

 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of factors including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products or disrupt the processing of transactions we have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption occurs we could incur significant losses and remediation costs 

 

additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately 

 

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our financial results 

 

projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we anticipate our infrastructure investments generally are longterm in nature and it is possible that these investments may not generate our expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete implementation or other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our financial results 

 

our reputation sales and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 

 

there are occasions when we manufacture products with quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping thus causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment it can result in additional shipping costs discounts refunds and loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues can result in adverse financial consequences and a negative impact on our reputation 

 

some of our products are sold by third parties 

 

our products are not sold only by us but by thirdparty distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability 

 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

 

we manufacture most of our products but we also use thirdparty manufacturers for example for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

 

as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may find it otherwise necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses when these changes occur we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of selected assets we also may need to invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain in any of these events our costs may increase our assets may be impaired or our returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy 

 

our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to incur additional debt to fund business needs over the medium term 

 

as a result of the acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 our debt levels had significantly increased although we have reduced debt since the time of these acquisitions and we anticipate further debt reduction over the medium term from the generation of cash flow in our underlying businesses circumstances both within and beyond our control could cause debt levels to remain elevated for a longer timeframe than anticipated these higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs or opportunities and could result in higher financing costs 

 

if our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing from the capital markets 

 

credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings if our credit ratings are downgraded our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow would increase 

 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant government regulations for each plan future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental authorities 

 

our share price may be volatile 

 

changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of financing from capital markets and may affect our stockbased compensation arrangements among other things our stock price which has at times experienced substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including current performance and market expectations for our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and other companyspecific events can also impact our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will be less volatile in the future 

 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the carrying value of goodwill we 

make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges 

 

potential adverse developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including those involving product and trade compliance foreign corrupt practices act issues and other matters could impact us materially 

 

our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations including but not limited to proceedings or lawsuits related to class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices the impact of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including but not limited to product customs and trade compliance matters see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents could harm our ability to compete or grow 

 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we are held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or will be available at all the defense of these claims whether or not meritorious and the development of new technology could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert the attention of management 

 

we also could have our intellectual property infringed we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as on nondisclosure agreements however it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization to independently develop similar technologies or to breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our profitability 

 

we have obtained and applied for some us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek patents as appropriate we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

 

we need to comply with numerous environmental health and safety laws 

 

due to the nature of our business we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and generally impact our financial performance we have accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup sites including sites for which governmental 

agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation and general liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

proposed changes in us tax legislation could materially impact our results 

 

currently the majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and our employees are located outside of the us we have not accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain proposals could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

 

our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may impact our effective tax rate andor our financial results 

 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our future operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation 

 

the risks described above are not exclusive if any of the above risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

as of january 2 2010 the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed the company is participating with other prps at such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

 

the company has accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or 

amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites that could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

 

as of january 2 2010 the company’s estimated accrued liability associated with compliance and remediation costs was approximately 60 million see also note 8 “contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements of the company’s 2009 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated herein by reference

avery dennison corporation “avery dennison” the “company” “registrant” “issuer” which may be referred to as “we” or “us” was incorporated in 1977 in the state of delaware as avery international corporation the successor corporation to a california corporation of the same name which was incorporated in 1946 in 1990 the company merged one of its subsidiaries into dennison manufacturing company “dennison” as a result of which dennison became a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and in connection with which company’s name was changed to avery dennison corporation our homepage on the internet is wwwaverydennisoncom and you can learn more about us by visiting our web site our web site address provided in this annual report on form 10k is not intended to function as a hyperlink and the information on our web site is not and should not be considered part of this report and is not incorporated by reference in this document 

 

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials office products and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are sold to label printers and converters that “convert” the materials into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting some are sold by us in converted form as printable media tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of office products and other converted products and other items not involving pressuresensitive components such as binders organizing systems markers fasteners business forms as well as tickets tags radiofrequency identification “rfid” inlays and imprinting equipment for retail and apparel manufacturers 

 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

 

because selfadhesive materials are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation the use of selfadhesive materials often provides cost savings compared with other materials that require heat or moistureactivated adhesives selfadhesive materials also provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape and color 

 

our reporting segments are 

 

  

in addition to our reporting segments we have other specialty converting businesses comprised of several businesses that produce specialty tapes and highly engineered labels including rfid inlays and labels and other converted products

other matters 

 

we use various raw materials primarily paper plastic films and resins as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various commercial and industrial sources which are subject to price fluctuations although shortages could occur from time to time these raw materials are generally available 

 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which can be regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled would be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in our facilities in peachtree city georgia fort wayne and greenfield indiana and quakertown pennsylvania as well as in other plants in the united states argentina australia belgium brazil canada china colombia france germany india korea luxembourg malaysia mexico the netherlands south africa thailand and the united kingdom

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend  

our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

 

the demand for our products is impacted by the effects of and changes in worldwide conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

 

we have operations in over 60 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in the political social economic and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and international trade regulations including tariffs in the countries in which we operate as well as the impact of these conditions on the underlying demand for our products 

adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets could negatively impact our customers suppliers and our business 

 

financial markets in the united states europe and asia have experienced significant disruption in recent months including among other things significant volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations inflation reduced consumer spending and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates while currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets in major economies these economic developments affect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours in addition they could have a variety of negative effects such as reduction in revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable require recognition of impairments of capitalized assets including goodwill and other intangibles and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

we are not able to predict the duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

 

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect our sales and profitability 

 

approximately 65 of our sales are from international operations fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction translation and other losses to us which can negatively impact our sales and profitability margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially and adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

 

we monitor our foreign currency exposures and may from time to time use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

 

we are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share and experience falling prices adversely affecting our financial results 

 

we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key markets and implement new technologies making them more competitive there is also the possibility that competitors will be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

 

we are also at risk with regards to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products 

 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor 

 

inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to recur and our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on these cost increases to customers in our selling prices for products and to effect improvements in productivity also it is important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and packaging from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

potential adverse developments in legal proceedings investigations and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including those involving product and trade compliance foreign corrupt practices act issues and other matters could impact us materially 

 

our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations including but not limited to proceedings or lawsuits related to class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices the impact of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including but not limited to product customs and trade compliance matters see item 1 “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

 

our future results may be affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

 

we are undertaking efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations including closure of facilities headcount reductions organizational simplification and restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation and using a variety of tools such as lean sigma and kaizen events to increase productivity which is not assured lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk and loss of sales 

 

we have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel 

 

in order to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future for example we acquired dm label and paxar in 2008 and 2007 respectively various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with the acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines markets customers suppliers production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results are uncertain particularly across our geographically dispersed organization we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets set for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both prior to and after the closing of the transactions our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention 

 

there can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future 

 

our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to incur additional debt to fund business needs over the medium term 

 

as a result of the paxar acquisition in 2007 our debt levels approximately doubled although significant debt reduction is anticipated over the medium term from the generation of cash flow in our underlying businesses circumstances both within and beyond our control could cause debt levels to remain elevated for a longer time frame than anticipated these higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs or opportunities and could result in higher financing costs 

 

slower growth in key markets could adversely affect our profitability 

 

our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key end use markets or applications for our products our overall performance will be influenced by these markets 

 

our customers are widely diversified but in certain portions of our business industry concentration has increased the importance and decreased the number of significant customers 

 

in particular sales of our office and consumer products in the united states are concentrated in a few major customers principally office product superstores mass market distributors and wholesalers the business risk associated with this concentration including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt writeoffs could negatively affect our margins and profits 

our ability to develop and successfully market new products and applications is important for our business 

 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or launch of new products that could compromise our competitive position in such product markets 

 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents could harm our ability to compete or grow 

 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are from time to time involved in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we are held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages or obtain licenses or to cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses will be available at all or will be available on commercially reasonable terms and the cost to defend these claims whether or not meritorious or to develop new technology could be significant and could divert the attention of management 

 

we also could have our intellectual property infringed we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as on nondisclosure agreements but it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization to independently develop similar technologies or to breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs involved to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our profitability 

 

we have obtained and applied for some us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek patents as appropriate we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties might be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

 

changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

 

our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may impact our effective tax rate andor our financial results 

 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we 

could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse effect on our future operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may also change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation 

 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant government regulations for each plan future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental authorities 

 

in order for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services 

 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to expansion in certain markets and the ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions it may be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees 

 

we have outsourced certain services to multiple thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our businesses andor increased costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing strategies or if thirdparty providers do not perform effectively and timely or we experience problems with a transition we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs and experience delays to correct errors made by such service providers 

 

we need to comply with numerous environmental health and safety laws 

 

due to the nature of our business we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and generally impact our financial performance we have accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup sites including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

 

we are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance 

 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation and general liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results we retain some portion of our insurable risks and therefore unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our operations sales customer relations and financial results 

 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to a number of factors including but not limited to damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence natural disasters power failures human error viruses and data security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or if installation is delayed could cause delays or cancellation of customer orders impede the manufacture or shipment of products and disrupt the processing of transactions we have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption occurs we could incur significant losses and remediation costs 

 

additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately 

 

miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our financial results 

 

projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we anticipate our infrastructure investments are generally longterm in nature and it is possible that these investments may not generate our expected return due to changes in the marketplace failures to complete implementation and other factors significant changes from our expected need for andor returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our financial results 

 

our share price may be volatile 

 

our stock price which has at times experienced substantial volatility is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including current performance and market expectations for our future performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and announcements concerning investigations can also impact our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will be less volatile in the future 

 

if our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing from capital markets 

 

credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings if our credit ratings are further downgraded our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow would increase 

 

our reputation sales and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 

 

there are occasions when we manufacture products with quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping thus causing delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when issues are discovered after shipment this causes additional shipping costs possible discounts possible refunds and potential loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues can result in financial consequences along with a negative impact on our reputation 

 

some of our products are sold by third parties 

 

our products are not only sold by us but by thirdparty distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

 

we manufacture most of our products but we also use thirdparty manufacturers for example for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth 

 

goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in assessing the carrying value of goodwill we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates based on our business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit we could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges 

 

changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses 

 

as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses when these changes occur we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets we may also need to invest in new businesses that have shortterm returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain in any of these events our costs may increase our assets may be impaired or our returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy 

 

the risks described above are not exclusive if any of the above risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at seventeen waste disposal or waste recycling sites including paxar sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed the company is participating with other prps at such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

 

the company has accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

 

as of december 27 2008 the company’s estimated accrued liability associated with compliance and remediation costs was approximately 60 million including estimated liabilities related to the company’s recent acquisitions see also note 8 “contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 60 of the company’s 2008 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated herein by reference

in 2005 the company contacted relevant authorities in the us and reported on the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of the company’s reflective business in china and involved among other things impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments the payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been minor in amount and of limited duration corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken sales of the company’s reflective business in china in 2005 were approximately 7 million based on findings to date no changes to the company’s previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result of these matters however the company expects that fines or other penalties could be incurred while the company is unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties it believes that its behavior in detecting investigating responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably 

 

in addition on or about october 10 2008 the company notified relevant authorities that it had discovered questionable payments to certain foreign customs and other regulatory officials by some employees of its recently acquired companies these payments do not appear to have been made for the purpose of obtaining business from any governmental entity the company is in the process of conducting a review and is taking remedial measures to comply with the provisions of the us foreign corrupt practices act 

the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of the business based upon current information management believes that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect the company’s financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tableend  

organization of information 

 

management’s discussion and analysis provides a narrative concerning our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements it includes the following sections 

 

 

 

definition of terms 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap our discussion of financial results includes several nongaap measures to provide additional information concerning avery dennison corporation’s the “company’s” performance these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with nor are they a substitute for gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are intended to supplement our presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with gaap refer to “uses and limitations of nongaap measures” 

 

we use the following terms 

 

  

as a result of the sale of our raised reflective pavement marker business during 2006 discussed below in “divestitures” the discussions which follow reflect our restated results for the accounting change as well as summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise noted however the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations 

overview and outlook 

 

overview 

 

sales 

 

our sales from continuing operations increased 6 in 2008 compared to growth of 13 in 2007 driven primarily by the acquisitions of paxar corporation “paxar” and dm label group “dm label” and the effect of currency translation 

 

 

 

 

  

on an organic basis the decline of 3 in 2008 reflected worsening global economic conditions in 2008 which were experienced first in the us then western europe then in our emerging markets asia eastern europe and latin america organic sales growth of 1 in 2007 reflected international growth partially offset by slower and more competitive market conditions in north america 

 

net income 

 

net income decreased 37 million or 12 in 2008 compared to 2007 

 

negative factors affecting the change in net income included 

 

  

positive factors affecting the change in net income included 

 

  

acquisitions 

 

we completed the paxar acquisition on june 15 2007 the combination of the paxar business into our retail information services segment increases our presence in the retail information and brand identification market combines complementary strengths and broadens the range of our product and service capabilities improves our ability to meet customer demands for product innovation and improved quality of service and facilitates expansion into new product and geographic segments see “paxar acquisitionrelated actions” below for information on cash costs incurred and cost synergies achieved during integration 

 

we completed the dm label acquisition on april 1 2008 dm label operations are included in our retail information services segment 

see note 2 “acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

paxar acquisitionrelated actions 

 

the following integration actions resulted in headcount reductions of approximately 1695 positions in our retail information services segment 

 

 

 

 

  

at year end the paxar integration was essentially complete cost synergies resulting from the integration were approximately 20 million in 2007 and an incremental 88 million in 2008 we expect to realize incremental savings of approximately 12 million in 2009 

 

refer to note 2 “acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

cost reduction actions 

 

q4 2008 — 2009 actions 

 

in response to worsening market conditions we are undertaking new restructuring actions that began in the fourth quarter of 2008 that are expected to impact approximately 10 of the company’s global workforce refer to the “outlook” section for total estimated costs to be incurred and annualized savings expected to be achieved through these actions 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded 123 million in pretax charges related to these restructuring actions consisting of severance and related employee costs asset impairment charges and lease cancellation costs severance and employee related costs related to approximately 700 positions impacting all of our segments and geographic regions we expect to realize savings of approximately 18 million in 2009 related to these charges 

 

q1 2008 — q3 2008 actions 

 

during the first three quarters of 2008 we implemented cost reduction actions resulting in pretax charges of 228 million including severance and employee related costs for approximately 645 positions asset impairment charges and lease cancellation costs we expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately 20 million most of which will benefit 2009 as a result of these restructuring actions 

 

q4 2006 — 2007 actions 

 

we incurred 314 million in pretax charges related to cost reduction actions initiated from late 2006 through the end of 2007 including severance and employee related costs for approximately 555 positions asset impairment charges and lease cancellation costs savings from these restructuring actions net of transition costs were 

approximately 5 million in 2008 and 32 million in 2007 we expect to realize incremental savings of 8 million in 2009 

 

q4 2005 — q3 2006 actions 

 

during 2007 and 2006 we realized annualized pretax savings net of transition costs of over 90 million resulting from restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005 these restructuring actions resulted in headcount reductions of approximately 1150 positions which impacted all of our segments and geographic regions and were completed in 2006 

 

refer to note 10 “cost reduction actions” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

divestitures 

 

the divestiture of our raised reflective pavement marker business which had sales of approximately 23 million in 2005 was completed during the second quarter of 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business the results of this business have been accounted for as discontinued operations in 2006 this business was previously included in the pressuresensitive materials segment 

 

in addition the divestitures of two product lines were completed in the first quarter of 2006 the first product line which was included in the office and consumer products segment had estimated sales of 60 million in 2005 with minimal impact to income from operations the second product line which was included in other specialty converting businesses had annual sales of approximately 10 million in 2005 with minimal impact to income from operations 

 

free cash flow 

 

we use free cash flow as a measure of funds available for other corporate purposes such as dividends debt reduction acquisitions and repurchases of common stock management believes that this measure provides meaningful supplemental information to our investors to assist them in their financial analysis of the company management believes that it is appropriate to measure cash flow including net proceeds from sale of investments after spending on property plant equipment software and other deferred charges because such spending is considered integral to maintaining or expanding our underlying business this measure is not intended to represent the residual cash available for discretionary purposes refer to “uses and limitations of nongaap measures” for further information regarding limitations of this measure 

 

 

 

 

  

the increase in free cash flow in 2008 of 121 million is primarily due to increased cash flow provided by operating activities and reduced capital spending partially offset by lower net income compared to 2007 

 

the decrease in free cash flow in 2007 of 87 million reflects higher spending on property plant and equipment and software and other deferred charges as well as lower net income compared to 2006 

 

see “analysis of results of operations” and “liquidity” in “financial condition” below for more information 

legal proceedings 

 

we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices 

 

as previously disclosed we have discovered instances of conduct by certain employees that potentially violate the us foreign corrupt practices act we reported that conduct to authorities in the us and we believe it is possible that fines or other penalties could be incurred 

 

the board of directors created an ad hoc committee comprised of certain independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters 

 

we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could be adverse and material these and other matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements 

 

outlook 

 

certain statements contained in this section are “forwardlooking statements” and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties refer to our “safe harbor statement” herein 

 

in light of the global economic environment we are not providing a 2009 earnings forecast at this time if current exchange rate trends continue they would have an unfavorable effect on earnings in 2009 

 

we expect incremental pension and other employeerelated expenses and contributions in 2009 

 

in response to increased uncertainty resulting from worsening global economic conditions we initiated new cost reduction actions that target approximately 150 million in annualized savings by 2010 of which an estimated 70 million net of transition costs is expected to benefit 2009 we expect to incur approximately 120 million of restructuring charges associated with these actions with the majority to be incurred in 2009 

 

in addition to the savings from these new actions we expect approximately 40 million of savings from previously implemented actions which includes 12 million of benefits from the paxar integration 

 

the total incremental savings from implemented cost reduction actions discussed above are expected to be 110 million for 2009 we anticipate higher charges related to restructuring actions in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

we anticipate lower interest expense in 2009 subject to currently anticipated retirements andor refinancings of currently outstanding indebtedness and assuming a continuation of current market rates for our variable interest rate debt and commercial paper 

 

the annual effective tax rate will be impacted by future events including changes in tax laws geographic income mix tax audits closure of tax years legal entity restructuring and release of or accrual for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets the effective tax rate can potentially have wide variances from quarter to quarter resulting from interim reporting requirements and the recognition of discrete events 

 

we anticipate our capital and software expenditures to be in the range of 120 million to 150 million in 2009 

analysis of results of operations 

 

income from continuing operations before taxes 

 

 

 

 

 

sales 

 

sales increased 6 in 2008 and 13 in 2007 driven primarily by acquisitions and the effect of currency translation the acquisitions of paxar and dm label increased sales by an estimated 450 million in 2008 the acquisition of paxar increased sales by an estimated 510 million in 2007 foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately 167 million in 2008 compared to approximately 232 million in 2007 

 

on an organic basis sales declined 3 in 2008 and grew 1 in 2007 the decline in 2008 primarily reflected worsening global economic conditions in 2008 which were experienced first in the us then western europe then in our emerging markets organic sales growth of 1 in 2007 reflected international growth partially offset by slower and more competitive market conditions in north america 

 

organic sales growth or decline by our major regions of operation was as follows 

 

 

 

on an organic basis international sales were roughly flat in 2008 compared to growth of 4 in 2007 the growth in 2007 reflected increases in most of our businesses outside of the us particularly in our emerging markets 

 

in the us sales on an organic basis declined 7 in 2008 and 4 in 2007 due primarily to the slowdown in the us economy combined with the reduction of inventories by customers particularly in the office and consumer products segment 

 

in our pressuresensitive materials segment soft market conditions experienced in the second half of 2007 in the roll materials businesses in north america and europe continued in 2008 spreading to latin america and asia in our retail information services segment we continued to experience weakness in domestic retail apparel markets in 2008 and began to experience weakness in the european retail markets our other specialty converting businesses also experienced declines in 2008 primarily due to lower volume in products sold to the automotive and housing construction industries 

refer to “results of operations by segment” for further information on segments 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit margin in 2008 decreased from 2007 as higher gross profit margin associated with sales from the paxar business and savings from restructuring actions and other sources of productivity were more than offset by the carryover effect of prior year price competition in the roll materials business higher raw material and other cost inflation negative product mix shifts lower sales of higher gross profit margin products as well as reduced fixed cost leverage on an organic basis 

 

gross profit margin in 2007 decreased from 2006 due to price competition and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business and higher raw material costs the negative effect of these factors was partially offset by the addition of the higher gross profit margin paxar business as well as benefits from our ongoing productivity improvement and cost reduction actions 

 

marketing general and administrative expense 

 

marketing general and administrative expense in 2008 increased from 2007 as benefits from productivity improvement initiatives and lower net transition costs related to the paxar and dm label acquisitions were more than offset by 

 

  

marketing general and administrative expense in 2007 increased from 2006 as savings from restructuring actions and other cost reductions were more than offset by 

 

  

interest expense 

 

interest expense increased 10 or approximately 11 million in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in borrowings to fund the paxar and dm label acquisitions partially offset by the benefit of lower interest rates 

 

other expense net 

 

 

 

for all three years presented “other expense net” consisted of charges for restructuring including severance and other employeerelated costs asset impairment charges and lease cancellation costs as described above in the “cost reduction actions” and “paxar acquisitionrelated actions” sections herein refer also to note 10 “cost reduction actions” to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

in 2008 other items included in “other expense net” consisted of a gain on sale of investments 45 million 

in 2007 other items included in “other expense net” included 

 

  

in 2006 other items included in “other expense net” included 

 

  

net income 

 

 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate was approximately 2 for 2008 compared with approximately 19 for 2007 our 2008 effective tax rate reflects 453 million of benefit from changes in the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets favorable geographic income mix and a 248 million detriment from accruals for uncertain tax positions refer to note 11 “taxes on income” for more information 

 

income from discontinued operations 

 

income from discontinued operations includes the divestiture of our raised reflective pavement markers business as noted in the “overview” section above the divestiture of this business was completed during 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit 149 million due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business and a gain on sale of 13 million 

 

income from discontinued operations included net sales of approximately 7 million in 2006 

results of operations by segment 

 

pressuresensitive materials segment 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

sales in our pressuresensitive materials segment increased 4 in 2008 and 8 in 2007 the increase in reported sales for this segment included a favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 132 million in 2008 and approximately 174 million in 2007 

 

organic sales growth was 1 in 2008 and 3 in 2007 which reflected growth in our roll materials business in asia latin america and europe partially offset by declines in our north american roll materials businesses the growth resulting from market expansion in our roll materials business in asia and latin america during 2007 slowed in 2008 in asia the roll materials business experienced high singledigit growth in 2008 compared to doubledigit growth in 2007 in latin america the roll materials business experienced low singledigit growth in 2008 compared to mid singledigit growth in 2007 our roll materials business in europe experienced low singledigit organic sales growth in both 2008 and 2007 

 

in our north american roll materials business slow market conditions in 2008 and 2007 resulted in the low singledigit decline in sales on an organic basis in 2007 a more competitive environment due in part to capacity additions in the industry led to price reductions to maintain market share 

 

in our graphics and reflective business sales declined on an organic basis at a mid singledigit rate in 2008 as growth in asia and latin america was more than offset by declines in the us and europe the decline primarily reflected lower promotional spending on graphic products by businesses in response to weak market conditions in 2007 our graphics and reflective business experienced mid singledigit organic sales growth as strong international growth was partially offset by declines in the us 

 

operating income 

 

decreased operating income in 2008 reflected the negative effects of raw material and other cost inflation and prior year price reductions which more than offset the initial benefits of recent price increases and negative product mix partially offset by higher unit volume and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives 

 

increased operating income in 2007 reflected higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives these initiatives were partially offset by a more competitive pricing environment and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business higher raw material costs and transition costs related to restructuring actions 

 

operating income for all three years reflected restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2008 operating income included lease cancellation charges in 2007 operating income included a reversal of an accrual related to a lawsuit in 2006 operating income included a gain on sale of assets legal fees related to a lawsuit and lease cancellation charges 

retail information services segment 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

sales in our retail information services segment increased 32 in 2008 compared to an increase of 76 in 2007 in 2008 the increase reflected an estimated 450 million in sales from the paxar and dm label acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation approximately 7 million in 2007 the increase reflected an estimated 510 million in sales from the paxar acquisition and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation approximately 17 million 

 

on an organic basis sales declined 6 in 2008 reflecting continued weakness in the domestic retail apparel markets and weakness experienced in the european retail markets organic sales growth of approximately 1 in 2007 reflected increased sales for the european retail market partially offset by a decline in orders related to apparel shipped to north american retailers and brand owners 

 

operating income 

 

increased operating income in 2008 reflected higher sales incremental synergies and lower transition costs related to the paxar integration and savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives partially offset by raw material and other cost inflation and incremental amortization of acquisition intangibles 

 

operating loss in 2007 reflected transition costs and integrationrelated asset impairment charges associated with the paxar acquisition amortization of acquisition intangibles and higher expenses due to investments for growth in asia including higher employeerelated costs higher operating costs were partially offset by higher sales and savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives 

 

restructuring costs asset impairment and lease cancellation charges were incurred in all three years 

 

office and consumer products segment 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

sales in our office and consumer products segment decreased 8 in 2008 and 5 in 2007 the decline in reported sales in both years reflected lower sales on an organic basis partially offset by the favorable impact of 

foreign currency translation approximately 12 million in 2008 and 25 million in 2007 in 2007 the decline included the negative impact of product line divestitures approximately 9 million 

 

on an organic basis sales declined approximately 9 in 2008 and 7 in 2007 these declines reflected a combination of weak end market demand and tighter inventory controls by customers 

 

operating income 

 

decreased operating income in 2008 reflected lower sales and cost inflation partially offset by price increases and savings from restructuring actions and other productivity improvement initiatives 

 

decreased operating income in 2007 reflected lower sales and higher raw material costs partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and productivity improvement initiatives 

 

restructuring costs were incurred in all three years and asset impairment charges were incurred in 2008 and 2006 operating income in 2007 included lease cancellation costs and expense related to a divestiture in 2006 operating income included a gain from sale of assets a gain from curtailment and settlement of a pension obligation and a net gain from a product line divestiture 

 

other specialty converting businesses 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

sales in our other specialty converting businesses decreased 6 in 2008 and increased 3 in 2007 in 2008 the decrease reflected lower sales on an organic basis partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation approximately 17 million in 2007 the increase reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency translation approximately 16 million partially offset by the impact of a product line divestiture net of a small acquisition approximately 2 million 

 

on an organic basis sales declined 8 in 2008 reflecting lower volume in products sold to the automotive and housing construction industries and the negative effect of exiting certain lowmargin products in our specialty tape business partially offset by growth in our radiofrequency identification “rfid” division in 2007 sales grew 1 on an organic basis as the loss of sales from exiting certain lowmargin products in our specialty tape business was more than offset by solid growth in other parts of the specialty tape business as well as growth of the rfid division 

 

operating income 

 

decreased operating income for these businesses in 2008 reflected lower sales and cost inflation partially offset by the benefit of productivity improvement initiatives and a reduction in operating loss in our rfid division 

 

increased operating income for these businesses in 2007 reflected higher sales savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives and a reduction in operating loss from the rfid division 

 

operating income for all years included restructuring costs and asset impairment charges 

financial condition 

 

liquidity 

 

cash flow from operating activities 

 

 

 

for cash flow purposes changes in assets and liabilities exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and certain noncash transactions discussed in “analysis of selected balance sheet accounts” below 

 

in 2008 cash flow provided by operating activities improved compared to 2007 due to improved collection of trade accounts receivable extended payment terms on accounts payable decreased purchases and better management of inventory lower rebate payments and lower income tax payments net of refunds these positive factors were partially offset by higher payments for interest and higher material costs 

 

in 2007 cash flow provided by operating activities decreased compared to 2006 primarily due to shorter vendor payment terms on accounts payable and higher payments for income taxes these negative factors were partially offset by the collection of valueadded tax receivables in europe in other current assets and lower contributions to our pension plans

payments for acquisitions 

 

on april 1 2008 we completed the acquisition of dm label 

 

on june 15 2007 we completed the acquisition of paxar this acquisition was initially funded by commercial paper borrowings supported by a bridge revolving credit facility 

refer to note 2 “acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

payments for acquisitions during 2007 also included buyouts of minority interest shareholders associated with certain subsidiaries of rvl packaging inc and paxar of approximately 4 million 

 

capital and software spending

at year end 2008 our borrowings outstanding under foreign shortterm lines of credit were approximately 106 million weightedaverage interest rate of 69 compared to approximately 70 million at year end 2007 weightedaverage interest rate of 106 

 

shortterm variable rate domestic borrowings were 558 million at december 27 2008 weightedaverage interest rate of 09 compared to 9902 million at december 29 2007 weightedaverage interest rate of 52 at december 27 2008 shortterm variable rate domestic borrowings were from a mix of commercial paper and the revolving credit agreement during 2007 we increased our shortterm borrowings to initially fund the paxar acquisition as noted above in “payments for acquisitions” as well as to support share repurchases the change in outstanding commercial paper also reflects positive cash flow from operations 

 

we had mediumterm notes of 50 million outstanding at year end 2008 compared to 100 million at year end 2007 in 2008 and 2007 mediumterm notes of 50 million and 60 million were paid on maturity respectively 

 

refer to “capital resources” below for further information on the 2008 and 2007 borrowings and repayment of debt 

 

shareholders’ equity 

 

our shareholders’ equity was approximately 175 billion at year end 2008 compared to approximately 199 billion at year end 2007 our annual dividend per share increased to 164 in 2008 from 161 in 2007 

 

share repurchases 

 

on october 26 2006 the board of directors authorized the company to purchase an additional 5 million shares of the company’s stock under our existing stock repurchase program resulting in a total authorization of 

approximately 74 million shares of the company’s stock at that date we repurchased approximately 2 million and 8 million shares in 2008 and 2007 respectively cash payments for these repurchased shares were approximately 10 million and approximately 63 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively included in the 2007 cash payments were approximately 11 million related to shares repurchased in 2006 which settled in 2007 as of december 27 2008 approximately 39 million shares were available for repurchase under the board of directors’ authorization 

 

analysis of selected balance sheet accounts 

 

longlived assets 

 

goodwill increased 33 million during 2008 due to preliminary identified goodwill associated with the dm label acquisition 45 million and purchase price adjustments 10 million associated with the paxar acquisition completed in june 2007 partially offset by foreign currency translation 22 million 

 

other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions decreased 11 million during 2008 which reflected normal amortization expense 33 million and the impact of foreign currency translation 5 million partially offset by our preliminary valuation of the intangible assets of the dm label acquisition 19 million and incremental adjustments to intangible assets for the paxar acquisition 8 million 

 

refer to note 2 “acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

other assets decreased 115 million during 2008 due primarily to decreases in longterm pension assets 115 million and cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance 23 million and the impact of foreign currency translation 5 million partially offset by increases in purchases of software and other deferred charges net of related amortization 23 million and other assets 5 million 

 

other shareholders’ equity accounts 

 

the value of our employee stock benefit trust decreased 182 million in 2008 due to a decrease in the market value of shares held in the trust of approximately 174 million and the issuance of shares under our employee stock option and incentive plans of approximately 8 million 

 

accumulated other comprehensive loss income reflected a loss of 367 million during 2008 due primarily to a decline in the value of pension assets and current year recognition and amortization of net pension transition obligation prior service cost and net actuarial losses in our us and international pension and other postretirement plans 191 million as well as foreign currency translation 177 million 

 

impact of foreign currency translation 

 

 

 

in 2008 international operations generated approximately 67 of our net sales our future results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates which are influenced by global economic and political conditions 

 

the benefit to sales from currency translation in 2008 primarily reflected a benefit from sales denominated in euros and swiss francs as well as sales in the currencies of china brazil and australia partially offset by a negative impact of sales in the currencies of south korea great britain and south africa 

 

translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies are included in net income in the period incurred operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years in 2008 and 2007 we had no operations in hyperinflationary economies in 2006 the only hyperinflationary economy in which we operated was the dominican republic which uses the us dollar as its functional currency 

effect of foreign currency transactions 

 

the impact on net income from transactions denominated in foreign currencies may be mitigated because the costs of our products are generally denominated in the same currencies in which they are sold in addition to reduce our income statement and cash flow exposure to transactions in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts where available and appropriate 

 

analysis of selected financial ratios 

 

we utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance as discussed below 

 

operational working capital ratio 

 

working capital current assets minus current liabilities as a percent of net sales changed in 2008 primarily due to the impact of the paxar acquisition and a decrease in shortterm debt and accrued liabilities partially offset by a decrease in net trade accounts receivable inventories and current deferred tax assets as well as a net increase in hedge liabilities and income taxes payable 

 

in february 2008 one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement for a term loan credit facility with fifteen domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of 400 million which we guaranteed maturing february 8 2011 the proceeds from this term loan credit facility were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings included in current liabilities initially used to finance the paxar acquisition 

 

operational working capital as a percent of net sales is a nongaap measure and is shown below we use this nongaap measure as a tool to assess our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing and other activities that affect cash and cash equivalents deferred taxes and other current assets and other current liabilities that tend to be disparate in amount and timing and therefore may increase the volatility of the working capital ratio from period to period additionally the items excluded from this measure are not necessarily indicative of the underlying trends of our operations and are not significantly influenced by the daytoday activities that are managed at the operating level refer to “uses and limitations of nongaap measures” our objective is to minimize our investment in operational working capital as a percentage of sales by reducing this ratio to maximize cash flow and return on investment 

 

operational working capital 

 

 

 

as a percent of net sales operational working capital in 2008 decreased compared to 2007 the primary factors contributing to this change which includes the impact of the paxar acquisition and foreign currency translation are discussed below 

  accounts receivable ratio 

 

the average number of days sales outstanding was 61 days in 2008 compared to 62 days in 2007 calculated using a fourquarter average accounts receivable balance divided by the average daily sales for the year the current year average number of days sales outstanding benefited from improved payment terms with our customers the prior year average number of days sales outstanding was impacted primarily by the acquisition of paxar as well as the timing of sales and collections 

 

  inventory ratio 

 

average inventory turnover was 78 in both 2008 and 2007 calculated using the annual cost of sales divided by a fourquarter average inventory balance the current year average inventory turnover reflected the continued improvement of inventory management to adjust to the demand of our customers in the prior year this ratio was impacted primarily by the acquisition of paxar 

 

  accounts payable ratio 

 

the average number of days payable outstanding was 54 days in 2008 compared to 53 days in 2007 calculated using a fourquarter average accounts payable balance divided by the average daily cost of products sold for the year the current year average number of days payable outstanding was primarily due to improved payment terms with our suppliers partially offset by lower inventory purchases the prior year average number of days payable outstanding was impacted primarily by the timing of payments in europe partially offset by the acquisition of paxar 

 

  debttocapital ratio 

 

 

 

the increase in the debttocapital ratio in 2008 was primarily due to lower shareholders’ equity which reflected the recognition of net pension transition obligation prior service cost and net actuarial losses on our us and international pension and other postretirement plans and the negative impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by a net decrease in debt 

 

our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that we maintain specified ratios on total debt and interest expense in relation to certain measures of income under the loan agreements the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and other noncash expenses for the most recent twelvemonth fiscal period may not exceed 35 to 10 in addition earnings before interest taxes and other noncash expenses as a ratio to interest for the most recent twelvemonth fiscal period may not be less than 35 to 10 as of december 27 2008 we were in compliance with these debt covenants in january 2009 we amended the covenants included in the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement to exclude certain restructuring charges and to adjust covenant levels the adjusted covenant levels change quarterly and revert back to the preamendment levels during 2010 the amendments also reflect increased pricing levels for borrowings under both agreements consistent with the current pricing environment refer to note 15 “subsequent events” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

the fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of future cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities at year end the fair value of our total debt including shortterm borrowings was 19442 million in 2008 and 22507 million in 2007 

 

  shareholders’ equity ratios 

 

 

decreases in these ratios in 2008 compared to 2007 were primarily due to lower net income as well as a higher yearly average of total debt outstanding and shareholders’ equity these ratios are computed using actual net income and a fivequarter average denominator for equity and total debt accounts 

 

  capital resources 

 

capital resources include cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents and debt financing at year end 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1055 million held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents however there is no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

 

our 1 billion revolving credit facility which supports our commercial paper programs in the us and europe matures in 2012 based upon our current outlook for our business and market conditions we believe that this facility in addition to the committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit maintained in the countries in which we operate provide the liquidity to fund our operations during the recent turmoil in the financial markets we did not experience interruptions in our access to funding 

 

we have 5 million of longterm debt maturities due in 2009 

 

we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates and to possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties 

 

our total debt decreased 46 million in 2008 to 221 billion compared to 226 billion at year end 2007 reflecting primarily a decrease in shortterm borrowings used for general operational requirements partially offset by an increase in shortterm borrowings associated with the dm label acquisition refer to “borrowings and repayment of debt” in the “cash flow from financing activities” section above for more information 

 

in august 2007 we amended our existing revolving credit agreement increasing commitments from 525 million to 1 billion and extending the maturity to august 2012 commitments were provided by twelve domestic and foreign banks financing available under the agreement will be used as a commercial paper backup facility and is also available to finance other corporate requirements in january 2009 we amended the covenants related to this issuance as described above refer to note 15 “subsequent events” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

in september 2007 one of our subsidiaries issued 250 million 10year senior notes which we guaranteed bearing interest at a rate of 6625 per year due october 2017 the net proceeds from the offering were approximately 247 million and were used to pay down current longterm debt maturities of 150 million and reduce commercial paper borrowings of 97 million initially used to finance the paxar acquisition 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to permit the issuance of debt and equity securities proceeds from the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing existing debt and for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions this shelf registration replaced the shelf registration statement filed in 2004 the himeds units discussed below were issued under this registration statement 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we issued 440 million of 7875 corporate himeds units a mandatory convertible debt issue these himeds units are comprised of two components — purchase contracts obligating the holders to purchase from us a certain number of shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 68 million to approximately 86 million shares depending on the stock price at that time and senior notes due in 2020 the net proceeds from the offering were approximately 427 million which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the paxar acquisition in february 2009 we commenced an offer to exchange up to approximately 84 million units or 95 of our himeds units stated amount 5000 per unit in the form of corporate himeds units as the exchange is not mandatory there is no assurance that the exchange will occur in part or in its entirety refer to note 15 “subsequent events” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

in february 2008 one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement for a term loan credit facility with fifteen domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of 400 million which we guaranteed maturing february 8 2011 financing available under the agreement is to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes we used the term loan credit facility to reduce commercial paper borrowings previously issued to fund the acquisition of paxar the term loan credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio in january 2009 we amended these covenants as described above refer to note 15 “subsequent events” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

in february 2008 we terminated our bridge revolving credit agreement dated june 13 2007 with five domestic and foreign banks 

 

in addition we have a 364day revolving credit facility in which a foreign bank provides us up to euro 30 million 422 million in borrowings through march 5 2009 with the approval of the bank we may extend the revolving period and due date on an annual basis financing under this agreement is used to finance cash requirements of our european operations as of december 27 2008 there was 422 million of debt outstanding under this agreement there was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of december 29 2007 

 

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of 706 million and 809 million at the end of 2008 and 2007 respectively the aggregate contract amount of outstanding standby letters of credit approximated fair value 

 

our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately 468 million at year end 2008 our uncommitted lines of credit have no commitment expiration date and may be cancelled by the banks or us at any time 

 

credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings when determining a credit rating the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position business outlook consistency of cash flows debt level and liquidity geographic dispersion and management team we remain committed to retaining an investment grade rating 

 

our credit ratings as of year end 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

contractual obligations at year end 2008 

 

 

 

  

we enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and transportation the terms of our leases do not impose significant restrictions or unusual obligations except for the facility in mentor ohio as noted below the table above includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms of one year or more 

 

on september 9 2005 we completed the lease financing for a commercial facility the “facility” located in mentor ohio used primarily for the new headquarters and research center for our roll materials division the facility consists generally of land buildings equipment and office furnishings we have leased the facility under an operating lease arrangement which contains a residual value guarantee of 334 million we estimate that the residual value of the facility will not be less than the amount guaranteed 

 

we did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year end 2008 in the table of contractual obligations above because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems 

 

the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 23 million which is the portion that may become payable during 2009 the resolution of the balance is contingent upon various unknown factors and cannot be reasonably estimated refer to note 11 “taxes based on income” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on unrecognized tax benefits 

 

  legal proceedings 

 

we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices 

 

the board of directors created an ad hoc committee comprised of certain independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters 

 

we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could be adverse and material these and other matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements 

 

  environmental matters 

 

we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at seventeen waste disposal or waste recycling sites including former paxar sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

 

we have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

environmental liabilities which include costs associated with compliance and remediation were as follows 

 

 

 

as of december 27 2008 approximately 2 million associated with these environmental liabilities is estimated to be paid within the next 12 months 

 

our estimates could change depending on various factors such as modification of currently planned remedial actions changes in remediation technologies changes in site conditions a change in the estimated time to complete remediation changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and other factors 

 

  other 

 

in 2005 we contacted relevant authorities in the us and reported the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of our reflective business in china and involved among other things impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments the payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken sales of our reflective business in china in 2005 were approximately 7 million based on findings to date no changes to our previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result of these matters however we believe that fines or other penalties could be incurred while we are unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties we believe that our behavior in detecting investigating responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably 

 

in addition on or about october 10 2008 we notified relevant authorities that we had discovered questionable payments to certain foreign customs and other regulatory officials by some employees of our recently acquired companies these payments do not appear to have been made for the purpose of obtaining business from any governmental entity we are in the process of conducting a review and are taking remedial measures to comply with the provisions of the us foreign corrupt practices act 

 

we and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of our business based upon current information we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us 

 

we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized these costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary 

 

we participate in international receivable financing programs with several financial institutions whereby advances may be requested from these financial institutions such advances are guaranteed by us at december 27 2008 we had guaranteed approximately 13 million 

 

as of december 27 2008 we guaranteed up to approximately 22 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries’ obligations to their suppliers as well as approximately 556 million of certain of our subsidiaries’ lines of credit with various financial institutions 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we issued 440 million of 7875 corporate himeds units a mandatory convertible debt issue these himeds units are comprised of two components — purchase contracts obligating the 

holders to purchase from us a certain number of shares of our common stock in 2010 ranging from approximately 68 million to approximately 86 million shares depending on the quoted price per share of our common stock at that time and senior notes due in 2020 the net proceeds from the offering were approximately 427 million 

 

in february 2009 we commenced an offer to exchange up to approximately 84 million units or 95 of our himeds units stated amount 5000 per unit in the form of corporate himeds units as the exchange is not mandatory there is no assurance that the exchange will occur in part or in its entirety refer to note 15 “subsequent events” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

uses and limitations of nongaap measures 

 

we use certain nongaap financial measures that exclude the impact of certain events activities or strategic decisions the accounting effects of these events activities or decisions which are included in the gaap measures may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the company in a single period by excluding certain accounting effects both positive and negative eg gains on sales of assets restructuring charges asset impairments etc from certain of our gaap measures management believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the company’s “core” or “underlying” operating results these nongaap measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying business as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period 

 

limitations associated with the use of our nongaap measures include 1 the exclusion of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from the calculation of organic sales growth 2 the exclusion of mandatory debt service requirements as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business such as discretionary debt reductions dividends share repurchases acquisitions etc for calculation of free cash flow and 3 the exclusion of cash and cash equivalents shortterm debt deferred taxes and other current assets and other current liabilities as well as current assets and current liabilities of heldforsale businesses for the calculation of operational working capital while some of the items the company excludes from gaap measures recur these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts we believe that supplemental nongaap measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the company’s performance and operating trends 

 

related party transactions 

 

from time to time we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties we believe that such transactions are at arm’s length and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 

 

one of our directors peter w mullin is the chairman chief executive officer and a director of mc insurance services inc “mc” mullin insurance services inc “minc” and pwm insurance services inc “pwm” executive compensation and benefit consultants and insurance agents mr mullin is also the majority stockholder of mc minc and pwm collectively referred to as the “mullin companies” in october 2008 the mullin companies’ executive benefit and insurance agency related entities mc insurance agency service llc — “mcia” mullintbg insurance agency services llc — “mullintbg” and mullintbg advisory services llc — “mullintbg advisors” were sold to prudential financial “prudential” we paid premiums to insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the mullin companies in connection with various of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies and prudential have advised us that they earned commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and renewal of this insurance approximately 50 of these commissions were allocated to and used by mullintbg a previous affiliate of mc and now a whollyowned affiliate of prudential to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statement information to participants under various of our employee benefit plans during 2008 mullintbg advisors provided financial advisory services to participants in certain of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies own a minority interest in m financial holdings inc “mfh” substantially all of the life insurance policies which we placed through the mullin companies in 2008 and prior years are issued by insurance carriers that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance carriers and m life insurance company “m life” a whollyowned subsidiary of mfh reinsurance returns earned by m life are determined annually by the insurance carriers and can be negative or positive depending upon the results of m 

life’s aggregate reinsurance pool which consists of the insured lives reinsured by m life the mullin companies have advised us that they participated in net reinsurance gains of m life in addition the mullin companies have advised us that they also participated in net reinsurance gains of m life that are subject to risk of forfeiture none of these transactions were significant to our financial position or results of operations 

 

summary of related party activity 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense actual results could differ from those estimates 

 

critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require us to make difficult subjective andor complex judgments critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown we believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition sales returns and allowances accounts receivable allowances inventory and inventory reserves longlived asset impairments goodwill pension and postretirement benefits income taxes stockbased compensation restructuring and severance costs litigation and environmental matters and business combinations 

 

revenue recognition 

 

sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists pricing is determinable and collection is reasonably assured furthermore sales provisions for estimated returns and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers and when the customers assume the risks and rewards of ownership sales terms are generally fob free on board shipping point or fob destination depending upon local business customs for most regions in which we operate fob shipping point terms are utilized and sales are recorded at the time of shipment because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred in certain regions notably in europe fob destination terms are generally utilized and sales are recorded when the products are delivered to the customer’s delivery site because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances 

 

sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate volume promotional price cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products we review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available 

sales returns and allowances 

 

sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our customers both affiliated and nonaffiliated for the return of unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of return we accrue for returns and allowances based upon the gross price of the products sold and historical experience for such products we record these allowances based on the following factors i customer specific allowances and ii an estimated amount based on our historical experience for issues not yet identified 

 

accounts receivable allowances 

 

we are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy historical experience and future expectations the allowances for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value we record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount based on our historical experience for issues not yet identified no single customer represented 10 or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2008 and 2007 however our ten largest customers at year end 2008 represented approximately 13 of trade accounts receivable and consisted of five customers of our office and consumer products segment four customers of our pressuresensitive materials segment and one customer of both these segments the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 

 

inventory and inventory reserves 

 

inventories are stated at the lowerofcostormarket value and are categorized as raw materials workinprogress or finished goods cost is determined using the firstin firstout “fifo” method inventory reserves are recorded for matters such as damaged obsolete excess and slowmoving inventory we use estimates to record these reserves slowmoving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 

 

longlived asset impairments 

 

we record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of longlived assets are determined not to be recoverable impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value fair value is typically determined using quoted market prices if available or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition the key estimates applied when preparing cash flow projections relate to revenues gross margins economic life of assets overheads taxation and discount rates the amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our longlived assets 

 

goodwill 

 

our reporting units for the purpose of performing the impairment tests for goodwill consist of roll materials retail information services office and consumer products graphics and reflective products industrial products and business media for the purpose of performing the required impairment tests we primarily apply a present value discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of the reporting units with goodwill we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter 

 

our reporting units are composed of either a discrete business or an aggregation of businesses with similar economic characteristics certain factors may result in the need to perform an impairment test prior to the fourth quarter including significant underperformance of our business relative to expected operating results significant adverse economic and industry trends significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value and a decision to divest an individual business within a reporting unit 

goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize if any 

 

the second step if necessary compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount then goodwill is not considered impaired however if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using various valuation techniques with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales operating margins growth rates and discount rates assumptions about discount rates are based on a weightedaverage cost of capital for comparable companies assumptions about sales operating margins and growth rates are based on our forecasts business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm business plan period because of the increased uncertainty resulting from worsening global economic conditions our revenue projections generally assumed reductions in 2009 and a period of recovery beginning in 2010 

 

our first step impairment analysis for 2008 indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value the fair values of our reporting units except for the retail information services reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount by more than 100 of the respective reporting unit’s book value of goodwill at december 27 2008 the fair value of our retail information services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 of its book value of goodwill at december 27 2008 approximately 12 billion 

 

in evaluating the fair value of our retail information services reporting unit we assumed revenue declines for 2009 from 2008 reflecting a continuation of weakness in the retail apparel markets we then assumed revenue in 2010 increased to levels comparable with fiscal year 2007 including estimated sales for paxar and dm label adjusted for foreign currency translation we also assumed a discount rate of 118 and a perpetual growth rate of 3 reflecting the market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

the retail information services business is seasonal with higher volume in the second quarter we may need to perform an impairment test in the second quarter of 2009 if revenues or results for this reporting unit during the first and second quarters of 2009 are below our estimates the perpetual growth rate is decreased below 27 the discount rate increases above 12 or other key assumptions used in our fair value calculations in the fourth quarter of 2008 change 

 

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

effective december 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries in the event we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care costs future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost 

 

discount rate 

 

we in consultation with our actuaries annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our postretirement obligations the assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market 

rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available in the us our discount rate is determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds the projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans 

 

longterm return on assets 

 

we determine the longterm rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets taking into consideration that assets with higher volatility typically generate a greater return over the long run additionally current market conditions such as interest rates are evaluated and peer data is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness 

 

healthcare cost trend rate 

 

our practice is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits on a cash basis for measurement purposes a 7 annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2009 this rate is expected to decrease to approximately 5 by 2011 

 

income taxes 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

 

income taxes have not been provided on certain undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

 

pursuant to sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” sfas no 109 defines a tax planning strategy as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination we have also acquired certain net deferred tax assets with existing valuation allowances if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized we will release the valuation allowance to current earnings or adjust the purchase price allocation 

 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 

 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time pursuant to fasb interpretation no 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 requires a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to fin 48 and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 

 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate 

stockbased compensation 

 

we recognize expense for stockbased compensation in accordance with the provisions of the sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” 

 

valuation of stock options 

 

our stockbased compensation expense is the estimated fair value of options granted amortized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period the fair value of each of our stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model this model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options 

 

expected dividend yield was based on the current annual dividend divided by the 12month average of our monthly stock price prior to grant 

 

expected volatility for options was determined based on an average of implied and historical volatility 

 

riskfree rate was based on the average of the 52week average of the treasurybond rate that has a term corresponding to the expected option term 

 

expected term was determined based on historical experience under our stock option plans 

 

forfeiture rate assumption was determined based on historical data of our stock option forfeitures 

 

certain of the assumptions used above are based on management’s estimates as such if factors change and such factors require us to change our assumptions and estimates our stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different in the future 

 

we have not capitalized costs associated with stockbased compensation 

 

accounting for income taxes for stockbased compensation 

 

we elected to use the shortcut method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits related to employee stockbased compensation awards in addition we elected to follow the tax ordering laws to determine the sequence in which deductions and net operating loss carryforwards are utilized as well as the directonly approach to calculating the amount of windfall or shortfall tax benefits 

 

restructuring and severance costs 

 

we account for restructuring costs including severance and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the guidance provided in sfas no 112 “accounting for postemployment benefits” and sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” in the us we have a severance pay plan “pay plan” which provides eligible employees with severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination due to qualifying cost reduction actions we calculate severance pay using the severance benefit formula under the pay plan accordingly we record provisions for such amounts and other related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set forth under sfas no 112 in the absence of a pay plan or established local practices for overseas jurisdictions liability for severance and other employeerelated costs is recognized when the liability is incurred following the guidance of sfas no 146 

 

litigation and environmental matters 

 

we are currently involved in various lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of our business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated the best estimate within the range or if the most likely amount cannot be determined the low end of the range is accrued the ultimate resolution of these claims could affect future results of operations should our exposure be materially different from our earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously accrued 

environmental expenditures are generally expensed however environmental expenditures for newly acquired assets and those which extend or improve the economic useful life of existing assets are capitalized and amortized over the remaining asset life we review each reporting period our estimates of costs of compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of various sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us a potentially responsible party when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated the best estimate within the range is accrued when the best estimate within the range cannot be determined the low end of the range is accrued potential insurance reimbursements are not offset against potential liabilities and such liabilities are not discounted 

 

business combinations 

 

we account for business combinations using the accounting requirements of sfas no 141 “business combinations” in accordance with sfas no 141 we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from acquired businesses at fair value and we make estimates and assumptions to determine such fair values 

 

we utilize a variety of assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable in determining fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed these assumptions and estimates include discounted cash flow analysis growth rates discount rates current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain assets market rate assumptions for certain obligations and certain potential costs of compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of acquired properties we also utilize information obtained from management of the acquired businesses and our own historical experience from previous acquisitions 

 

we apply significant assumptions and estimates in determining certain intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions such as customer relationships patents and other acquired technology and trademarks and trade names and related applicable useful lives property plant and equipment receivables inventories investments tax accounts environmental liabilities stock option awards lease commitments and restructuring and integration costs unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results as such increases to estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period generally within one year of the acquisition date and as operating expenses thereafter 

 

effective january 2009 we will adopt sfas no 141r “business combinations” we are currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our financial results of operations and financial position 

 

recent accounting requirements 

 

during 2008 we adopted certain accounting and financial disclosure requirements of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” emerging issues task force “eitf” and financial interpretations by the staff of the fasb none of which had a significant impact on our financial results of operations and financial position refer to note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for more information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

risk management 

 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

 

our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes 

 

our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes as a result we enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets liabilities firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs when available and appropriate the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 

 

our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve our objectives we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings in june 2007 and august 2007 we entered into certain interest rate option contracts to hedge our exposure related to interest rate increases in connection with our 

anticipated longterm debt issuances such debt issuances were intended to replace the shortterm borrowings initially used to finance the paxar acquisition and to support the refinancing of our current longterm debt maturities in connection with these transactions we paid 115 million as option premiums of which 48 million was recognized during 2007 as a cash flow hedge loss in the consolidated statement of income and 67 million is being amortized over the life of the related forecasted hedged transactions 

 

additionally we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations these amounts are not material to our financial statements 

 

in the normal course of operations we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions other risks associated with foreign operations commodity price risk and litigation risk which are not represented in the analyses that follow 

 

foreign exchange valueatrisk 

 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions firm commitments accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were included in the model forecasted transactions which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model the var was estimated using a variancecovariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on twoyear historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks a 95 confidence level was used for a oneday time horizon 

 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately 17 million at year end 2008 

 

interest rate sensitivity 

 

an assumed 30 basis point move in interest rates 10 of our weightedaverage interest rate on floating rate debt affecting our variablerate borrowings would have had an estimated 4 million effect on our 2008 earnings

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials office products and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are “converted” into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting and some are sold in unconverted form as base materials tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of office products and other converted products and other items not involving pressuresensitive components such as binders organizing systems markers fasteners business forms as well as tickets tags and imprinting equipment for retail and apparel manufacturers 

 

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

 

selfadhesive materials may initially cost more than materials using heat or moisture activated adhesives but the use of selfadhesive materials often provides cost savings because of their easy and instant application without the need for adhesive activation they also provide consistent and versatile adhesion with minimal adhesive deterioration and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape and color 

 

our reporting segments are 

 

  

in addition to our reporting segments we have other specialty converting businesses comprised of several businesses that produce specialty tapes and highly engineered labels including radio frequency identification “rfid” inlays and labels and other converted products

other matters 

 

we use various raw materials primarily paper plastic films and resins and specialty chemicals which we purchase from a variety of commercial and industrial sources and which are subject to price fluctuations although from time to time shortages could occur these raw materials currently are generally available 

 

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which can be regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

 

a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled would be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

 

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in our facilities in peachtree city georgia fort wayne and greenfield indiana and quakertown pennsylvania as well as in other plants in the united states argentina australia belgium brazil canada china colombia france germany india korea luxembourg malaysia mexico the netherlands south africa thailand and united kingdom 

 

based on current information we do not believe that the costs of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

 

the demand for our products is impacted by economic conditions of the principal countries in which we operate a decline in the economies in these countries could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

 

we have operations in 60 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in the political social economic tax and regulatory environments including tariffs in the countries in which we operate as well as the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for our products in addition approximately 60 of our sales are from international operations 

fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction translation and other losses to us which can negatively impact our sales and profitability 

 

we operate in some highly competitive markets if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share and experience falling prices adversely affecting our financial results 

 

we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key markets and implement new technologies making them more competitive there is also the possibility that competitors will be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

 

we are also at risk with regards to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products 

 

we have acquired companies and our interest in various acquisition opportunities has increased acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including those related to integration technology and personnel 

 

in order to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future for example we acquired paxar corporation in 2007 various risks uncertainties and costs are associated with the acquisitions effective integration of systems controls objectives personnel product lines markets customers suppliers production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results are uncertain particularly across our geographically dispersed organization we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets set for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated both prior to and after the closing of the transactions our business and those of the acquired companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention 

 

there can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future 

 

our increased level of indebtedness following the paxar acquisition could limit our ability to incur additional debt to fund business needs over the medium term 

 

as a result of the paxar acquisition our debt levels approximately doubled although significant debt reduction is anticipated over the medium term from both the cash flow generation of our underlying businesses and the synergies expected from the acquisition circumstances both within and beyond our control could cause debt levels to remain elevated for a longer time frame than anticipated these higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs or opportunities and could result in higher financing costs 

 

potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and an investigation regarding competitive activities and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including those involving product and trade compliance foreign corrupt practices act issues and other matters could impact us materially 

 

our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations including an australian competition and consumer commission investigation into industry competitive practices lawsuits pertaining to this investigation or to the subject matter of now concluded investigations by the us department of justice the european commission and the competition law division of the department of justice of canada including purported class actions in the united states seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices and a purported class action related to alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the us department of justice investigation the impact of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act based on issues in china and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including product and trade compliance see item 1 “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

our future results may be affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

 

we are undertaking efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations including closure of facilities headcount reductions organizational simplification and restructuring process standardization and manufacturing relocation and using a variety of tools such as lean sigma and kaizen events to increase productivity which is not assured lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability in addition cost reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk and loss of sales 

 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are also dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and the ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor 

 

inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to recur and our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on these cost increases to customers in our selling prices for products and to effect improvements in productivity also it is important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and packaging from suppliers and to make timely delivery to customers a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

 

slower growth in key markets could adversely affect our profitability 

 

our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key end use markets or applications for our products our overall performance will be influenced by these markets 

 

our customers are widely diversified but in certain portions of our business industry concentration has increased the importance and decreased the number of significant customers 

 

in particular sales of our office and consumer products in the united states are concentrated in a few major customers principally office product superstores mass market distributors and wholesalers the business risk associated with this concentration including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt writeoffs could negatively affect our margins and profits 

 

our ability to develop and successfully market new products and applications is important in maintaining growth 

 

the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or launch of new products that could compromise our competitive position in such product markets 

 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents could harm our ability to compete or grow 

 

because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are from time to time involved in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights if we are held liable for infringement we could be required to pay damages or obtain licenses or to cease making or selling certain products there can be no assurance that licenses will be available at all or will be available on commercially reasonable terms and the cost to defend these claims whether or not meritorious or to develop new technology could be significant and could divert the attention of management 

 

we also could have our intellectual property infringed we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries as well as on nondisclosure agreements but it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization to independently develop similar technologies or to breach nondisclosure agreement entered into with us in addition many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as in the us the use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantage we have cause us 

to lose sales or otherwise harm our business further the costs involved to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our profitability 

 

we have obtained and applied for some us and foreign trademark registrations and patents and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek patents as appropriate we cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities further we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged in addition third parties might be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents 

 

the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

 

our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxrelated accounts our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may impact our effective tax rate andor our financial results we are in the process of reviewing paxar’s compliance with such requirements 

 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse effect on our future operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may also change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation 

 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings in future periods changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements 

 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant government regulations for each plan future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental authorities 

 

in order for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees we also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services 

 

there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to rapid expansion in certain markets and the ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions it may be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees we have outsourced certain services to multiple thirdparty service providers and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies service provider delays resource availability business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our businesses andor increased costs if we do not effectively develop implement and manage outsourcing strategies thirdparty providers do not perform effectively and timely or we experience problems with a transition we may experience disruption in our businesses we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers 

we need to comply with many environmental health and safety laws 

 

due to the nature of our business we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and generally impact our financial performance we have accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup sites including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we are in the process of reviewing the environmental matters related to paxar however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

 

in order to mitigate risk it is important that we obtain various types of insurance 

 

we have various types of insurance including property workers compensation and general liability insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results 

 

significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our operations sales customer relations and financial results 

 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to damage or interruptions caused by obsolescence natural disasters power failures viruses and security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly or if installation is delayed could cause significant disruptions we have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption occurs we could incur losses and costs for remediation and interruption of operations additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for a significant portion of our information technology support development and implementation 

 

our share price may be volatile 

 

our stock price is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including market expectations for our performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and announcements concerning industry investigations have also impacted our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will be less volatile in the future 

 

if our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing from capital markets 

 

credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings if our credit ratings were further downgraded our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow would increase 

 

our reputation sales and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 

 

there are occasions when we manufacture products with quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping but this causes delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when the issues are discovered after shipment this causes additional shipping costs possible discounts possible refunds and potential loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues can result in financial consequences along with a negative impact on our reputation 

some of our products are sold by third parties 

 

our products are not only sold by us but by third party distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability 

 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

 

we manufacture most of our products but we also use thirdparty manufacturers for example for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent product quality issues late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

 

the risks described above are not exclusive additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be less significant may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the above risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at eighteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites including paxar sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed the company is participating with other prps at such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

 

the company has accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

 

as of december 29 2007 the company’s estimated liability associated with compliance and remediation costs was approximately 38 million including preliminary liabilities related to the acquisition of paxar see also note 2 “acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 50 of the company’s 2007 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

during 2006 the company recognized 15 million for estimated environmental remediation costs for a former operating facility of the amount accrued which represented the lower end of the current estimated range of 15 million to 17 million for costs expected to be incurred approximately 9 million remained accrued as of december 29 2007 management considered additional information provided by outside consultants in revising its previous estimates of expected costs this estimate could change depending on various factors such as modification of currently planned remedial actions changes in the site conditions a change in the estimated time to complete remediation changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and other factors 

 

other amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and based upon current information management believes it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in april 2003 the us department of justice “doj” filed a complaint challenging the then proposed merger upmkymmene “upm” and the morgan adhesives “mactac” division of bemis co inc “bemis” the complaint alleged among other things that “upm and avery dennison have already attempted to limit competition between themselves as reflected in written and oral communications to each other through high level executives regarding explicit anticompetitive understandings although the extent to which these efforts have succeeded is not entirely clear to the united states at the present time” the doj concurrently announced a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label stock industry other investigations into competitive practices in the label stock industry were subsequently initiated by the european commission the competition law division of the department of justice of canada and the australian competition and consumer commission the company cooperated with all of these investigations and all except the australian investigation which is continuing have subsequently been terminated without further action by the authorities 

 

on april 24 2003 sentry business products inc filed a purported class action on behalf of direct purchasers of label stock in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois against the company upm bemis and certain of their subsidiaries seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive 

practices essentially repeating the underlying allegations of the doj merger complaint ten similar complaints were filed in various federal district courts in november 2003 the cases were transferred to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania and consolidated for pretrial purposes plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on february 16 2004 which the company answered on march 31 2004 on april 14 2004 the court separated the proceedings as to class certification and merits discovery and limited the initial phase of discovery to the issue of the appropriateness of class certification on january 4 2006 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on january 20 2006 the company filed an answer to the amended complaint on august 14 2006 the plaintiffs moved to certify a proposed class the company and other defendants opposed this motion on march 1 2007 the court heard oral argument on the issue of the appropriateness of class certification on august 28 2007 plaintiffs moved to lift the discovery stay which the company opposed on november 19 2007 the court certified a class consisting of all direct purchasers of paperbased label stock from the defendants during the period from january 1 1996 to july 25 2003 the company filed a petition to appeal this decision on december 4 2007 the company’s petition is still pending the company intends to defend these matters vigorously 

 

on may 21 2003 the harman press filed in the superior court for the county of los angeles california a purported class action on behalf of indirect purchasers of label stock against the company upm and upm’s subsidiary raflatac “raflatac” seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices essentially repeating the underlying allegations of the doj merger complaint three similar complaints were filed in various california courts in november 2003 on petition from the parties the california judicial council ordered the cases be coordinated for pretrial purposes the cases were assigned to a coordination trial judge in the superior court for the city and county of san francisco on march 30 2004 on january 21 2005 american international distribution corporation filed a purported class action on behalf of indirect purchasers in the superior court for chittenden county vermont similar actions were filed by richard wrobel on february 16 2005 in the district court of johnson county kansas and by chad and terry muzzey on february 16 2005 in the district court of scotts bluff county nebraska on february 17 2005 judy benson filed a purported multistate class action on behalf of indirect purchasers in the circuit court for cocke county tennessee these cases remain stayed pending the outcome of class certification proceedings in the federal actions the company intends to defend these matters vigorously 

 

the board of directors created an ad hoc committee comprised of independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters 

 

the company is unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could be adverse and material 

 

in 2005 the company contacted relevant authorities in the us and reported on the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of the company’s reflective business in china and involved among other things impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments the payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken sales of the company’s reflective business in china in 2005 were approximately 7 million based on findings to date no changes to the company’s previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result of these matters however the company expects that fines or other penalties could be incurred while the company is unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties it believes that its behavior in detecting investigating responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably 

 

the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of the business based upon current information management believes that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect the company’s financial position

definition of terms 

 

our discussion of financial results includes several nongaap measures to provide additional information concerning avery dennison corporation’s the “company’s” performance these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with nor are they a substitute for gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are intended to supplement the presentation of our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap refer to “uses and limitations of nongaap measures” 

 

we use the following terms 

 

  

change in accounting method 

 

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 we changed our method of accounting for inventories for our us operations from a combination of the use of the firstin firstout “fifo” and the lastin firstout “lifo” methods to the fifo method the inventories for our international operations continue to be valued using the fifo method we believe the change is preferable as the fifo method better reflects the current value of inventories on the consolidated balance sheet provides better matching of revenue and expense in the consolidated statement of income provides uniformity across our operations with respect to the method for inventory accounting and enhances comparability with peers furthermore this application of the fifo method will be consistent with our accounting of inventories for us income tax purposes 

as a result of the accounting change discussed above and the sale of our raised reflective pavement marker business during 2006 discussed below in “divestitures” the discussions which follow reflect our restated results for the accounting change as well as summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise noted however the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations

our sales from continuing operations increased 13 in 2007 compared to growth of 2 in 2006 driven primarily by the acquisition of paxar corporation “paxar” and currency translation due to the diverse mix of our businesses and the expansion of our retail information services segment the allocation of organic sales growth into its components of volume growth and price and mix have become less useful in our analysis we will continue to provide this information for those segments where it is useful 

 

 

 

 

  

organic sales growth of 1 in 2007 and 3 in 2006 reflected increases in most of our businesses outside of the us particularly in the emerging markets of asia eastern europe and latin america organic sales growth or decline by our major regions of operation was as follows 

 

 

 

outside of the us sales increased on an organic basis by 4 and 5 in 2007 and 2006 respectively due to market expansion and share gain in certain businesses 

 

in the us sales on an organic basis declined 4 in 2007 due primarily to the slowdown in the us retail environment particularly in our retail information services and office and consumer products segments as retailers lowered inventories in the face of slowing consumer demand our roll materials businesses in north america and europe also experienced soft market conditions especially in the second half of the year these conditions combined with capacity and demand imbalances impacted pricing in these markets as well 

 

in 2006 us sales were approximately even with 2005 the north american roll materials business was weak due to market share loss related to price increases implemented in 2005 and early 2006 to offset higher raw material costs as well as generally slow market conditions the benefit from growth of averybrand products and a strong backtoschool season in our office and consumer products segment in the us was offset by the loss of sales from exiting certain lowmargin private label business in that segment

acquisitions 

 

on june 15 2007 we completed the acquisition of paxar corporation “paxar” a global leader in retail tag ticketing and branding systems the combination of the paxar business into our retail information services segment increases our presence in the expanding and fragmented retail information and brand identification market combines complementary strengths and broadens the range of our product and service capabilities improves our ability to meet customer demands for product innovation and improved quality of service and facilitates expansion into new product and geographic segments the integration of this acquisition into our operations is also expected to result in significant cost synergies refer to the “outlook” section herein for further information 

 

see note 2 “acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

divestitures 

 

in december 2005 we announced our plan to sell our raised reflective pavement marker business which had sales of approximately 23 million in 2005 the divestiture of this business was completed during the second quarter of 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business the results of this business have been accounted for as discontinued operations for the years presented herein this business was previously included in the pressuresensitive materials segment 

 

in december 2005 we also announced the divestiture of two product lines these divestitures were completed in the first quarter of 2006 the first product line which was included in the office and consumer products segment had estimated sales of 60 million in 2005 with minimal impact to income from operations the second product line which was included in other specialty converting businesses had annual sales of approximately 10 million in 2005 with minimal impact to income from operations as part of these divestitures in 2005 we recorded severance and other employeerelated charges of approximately 6 million and asset impairments of approximately 9 million these charges were included in the “other expense net” line of our consolidated statement of income refer to note 10 “cost reduction actions” to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

 

cost reduction actions 

 

 

 

 

  

from late 2006 through the end of 2007 we initiated new cost reduction actions that are expected to yield annualized pretax savings of 45 million to 50 million in addition to cost synergies from the integration of paxar discussed below in 2007 savings from these actions net of transition costs were approximately 5 million 

incremental savings in 2008 associated with these actions are expected to be approximately 30 million with the balance expected to be realized in 2009 these restructuring actions result in headcount reductions of approximately 555 positions impacting all of our segments and geographic regions 

 

during 2007 and 2006 we realized annualized pretax savings net of transition costs of over 90 million resulting from restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005 these restructuring actions resulted in headcount reductions of approximately 1150 positions which impacted all of our segments and geographic regions and were completed in 2006 

 

in 2005 we also incurred charges related to the planned divestitures of several lowmargin businesses and product lines as discussed in the “divestitures” section 

 

refer to note 10 “cost reduction actions” to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

 

paxar acquisitionrelated actions 

 

 

 

 

  

in 2007 cost synergies resulting from the integration of paxar were approximately 20 million incremental cost synergies expected to be achieved through 2010 are discussed in the “outlook” section below these integration actions result in headcount reductions of approximately 1055 positions in our retail information services segment 

 

refer to note 2 “acquisitions” and note 10 “cost reduction actions” to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

 

effective rate of taxes on income 

 

the effective tax rate was 191 for the full year 2007 compared with 176 for the full year 2006 

 

unlike 2007 our effective tax rate for 2006 benefited from the following events 

 

 18 

 

free cash flow 

 

free cash flow which is a nongaap measure refers to cash flow from operating activities less spending on property plant equipment software and other deferred charges we use free cash flow as a measure of funds available for other corporate purposes such as dividends debt reduction acquisitions and repurchases of common stock management believes that this measure provides meaningful supplemental information to our investors to assist them in their financial analysis of the company management believes that it is appropriate to measure cash after spending on property plant and equipment software and other deferred charges because such spending is considered integral to maintaining or expanding our underlying business this measure is not intended to represent the residual cash available for discretionary purposes refer to “uses and limitations of nongaap measures” section for further information regarding limitations of this measure 

 

 

 

the decrease in free cash flow in 2007 of 71 million reflects higher spending on property plant and equipment and software and other deferred charges as well as lower net income compared to 2006 see “analysis of results of operations” and the liquidity section of “financial condition” below for more information 

 

investigations and legal proceedings 

 

we previously announced that we had been notified by the european commission the united states department of justice “doj” the competition law department of the department of justice of canada and the australian competition and consumer commission of their respective criminal investigations into competitive practices in the label stock industry we cooperated with all of these investigations and all except the australian investigation which is continuing have been terminated without further action by the authorities 

 

we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation 

 

we have discovered instances of conduct by certain employees in china that potentially violate the us foreign corrupt practices act we have reported that conduct to authorities in the us and we believe it is possible that fines or other penalties may be incurred 

 

we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could be adverse and material these and other matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements 

 

outlook 

 

in 2008 we anticipate a high singledigit to low doubledigit rate of revenue growth including both the benefit from the paxar acquisition approximately 65 benefit and a modest benefit from foreign currency translation based on year end exchange rates our revenue assumptions are subject to changes in economic and market conditions 

 

we estimate that the total annual cost synergies associated with the paxar integration to be in the range of 115 million to 125 million with an estimated 60 million to 70 million of these cost synergies expected to represent incremental savings during 2008 to accomplish our synergy target we will incur pretax cash costs estimated to be in the range of 165 million to 180 million approximately 75 million of these costs were incurred in 2007 and we estimate approximately 60 million to 70 million will be incurred in 2008 

 

we anticipate continued benefit from our ongoing productivity improvement initiatives in addition to the synergies resulting from the paxar integration described above we anticipate our restructuring and business realignment efforts to yield incremental savings in 2008 of an estimated 30 million net of transition costs we 

assume the benefits from these and other productivity initiatives will be partially offset by approximately 2 inflation of raw material costs approximately 50 million to 55 million based on current commodity pricing trends as well as higher costs associated with general inflation and investments for growth during 2008 

 

we anticipate price increases in 2008 to at least partially offset raw material inflation 

 

we estimate interest expense to be in the range of 125 million to 135 million approximately 20 million to 30 million higher than 2007 driven by acquisitionrelated debt our estimate is subject to changes in average debt outstanding and changes in market rates associated with the portion of our debt tied to variable interest rates 

 

we anticipate total restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2008 to be lower than the charges taken in 2007 

 

the annual effective tax rate will be impacted by future events including changes in tax laws geographic income mix tax audits closure of tax years legal entity restructuring and the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets the effective tax rate can potentially have wide variances from quarter to quarter resulting from interim reporting requirements and the recognition of discrete events 

 

we anticipate our capital and software expenditures before paxar integrationrelated activities to be approximately 195 million in 2008 capital and software expenditures related to the paxar integration are expected to total 40 million to 45 million of which approximately 25 million to 30 million is expected to be incurred during 2008 these costs are included in the total onetime cash cost estimate for the integration discussed above 

 

reflecting the foregoing assumptions we expect an increase in annual earnings and free cash flow in comparison with 2007 

 

analysis of results of operations 

 

income from continuing operations before taxes 

 

 

 

 

 

in 2006 we reclassified shipping and handling costs from “marketing general and administrative expense” to “cost of products sold” to align our businesses around a standard accounting policy previous results included herein have been reclassified for comparability to the current year 

 

sales 

 

sales increased 13 in 2007 compared to an increase of 2 in 2006 the benefit of the paxar acquisition net of product line divestitures increased sales by an estimated 500 million in 2007 product line divestitures net of incremental sales from acquisitions reduced sales by approximately 54 million in 2006 

 

foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately 232 million in 2007 compared to approximately 21 million in 2006 

organic sales growth was approximately 1 in 2007 compared to approximately 3 in 2006 organic sales growth in 2007 reflected growth in our pressuresensitive materials segment and other specialty converting businesses driven by expansion of international markets this international growth was partially offset by slower and more competitive market conditions in our north american roll materials business where unit volume growth was more than offset by negative price and mix the organic sales growth in pressuresensitive materials and other specialty converting businesses was offset by a decline in our office and consumer products segment due primarily to customer inventory reductions our retail information services segment experienced organic sales growth of 1 in 2007 reflecting increased sales for the european retail market partially offset by a decline in orders related to apparel shipped to north american retailers and brand owners 

 

on an organic basis sales in the us were approximately even in 2006 compared to a decrease of approximately 3 in 2005 the north american roll materials business was impacted by slow market conditions and share loss resulting from price increases the benefit from growth of averybrand products and a strong backtoschool season in our office and consumer products segment in the us was offset by the loss of sales from exiting certain lowmargin private label business approximate impact of 22 million in that segment 

 

refer to “results of operations by segment” for further information on segments 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit margin in 2007 decreased due to price competition and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business and higher raw material costs the negative effect of these factors was partially offset by the addition of the higher gross profit margin paxar business as well as benefits from our ongoing productivity improvement and cost reduction actions 

 

in 2006 the benefits of productivity improvement and cost reduction actions were partially offset by 

 

  

marketing general and administrative expenses 

 

marketing general and administrative expense in 2007 increased from 2006 as savings from restructuring actions and other cost reductions were more than offset by 

 

  

marketing general and administrative expense in 2006 increased from 2005 as the benefits from productivity improvement initiatives and cost reduction actions were more than offset by 

 

  

interest expense 

 

interest expense increased 90 or approximately 50 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to an increase in borrowings to fund the paxar acquisition as well as an increase in interest rates 

other expense net 

 

 

 

in 2007 and 2006 “other expense net” consisted of charges for restructuring including severance and other employeerelated costs and asset impairment charges related to cost reduction actions and divestitures as described above in the “cost reduction actions” and “paxar integration actions” sections herein refer also to note 10 “cost reduction actions” to the consolidated financial statements for more information

in 2005 other items included in “other expense net” consisted of a gain on the sale of assets 58 million partially offset by costs related to a lawsuit 38 million 

 

net income 

 

 

 

taxes on income 

 

both our 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates included the benefits from changes in the geographic mix of income and continued improvements in our global tax structure 

the effective tax rate in both years includes the impact from several tax audit settlements in various jurisdictions reflecting a net expense of 8 million in 2007 and a net benefit of 81 million in 2006 

 

income loss from discontinued operations 

 

income loss from discontinued operations includes the divestiture of our raised reflective pavement markers business as noted in the overview section above the divestiture of this business was completed during 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit 149 million due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business and a gain on sale of 13 million 

 

based on our estimated value of the raised reflective pavement markers business in 2005 we concluded that associated goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition of this business were impaired the resulting pretax impairment charge was approximately 74 million in 2005 

 

income from discontinued operations included net sales of approximately 7 million in 2006 and 23 million in 2005

sales in our pressuresensitive materials segment increased 8 in 2007 compared to 4 growth in 2006 organic sales growth in both 2007 and 2006 was approximately 3 

 

organic sales growth for 2007 and 2006 reflected growth in our roll materials and graphics and reflective businesses in asia latin america and europe partially offset by declines in our north american roll materials businesses for both years market expansion in our roll materials business contributed to doubledigit organic sales growth in asia and mid singledigit organic sales growth in latin america 

 

in both 2007 and 2006 our roll materials business in europe experienced low singledigit organic sales growth 

 

in our north american roll materials business 2007 sales on an organic basis declined at a low singledigit rate while 2006 sales were even with the prior year slow market conditions impacted both years in 2007 a more competitive environment due in part to capacity additions in the industry led to price reductions to maintain market share in 2006 the loss of market share following our implementation of selling price increases in 2005 and early 2006 contributed to a decline in this business 

 

our graphics and reflective business experienced mid singledigit organic sales growth in both 2007 and 2006 as strong international growth was partially offset by declines in the us 

 

the changes in reported sales for this segment included a favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 174 million in 2007 and approximately 15 million in 2006 

operating income 

 

increased operating income in 2007 and 2006 reflected higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives in 2007 these initiatives were partially offset by a more competitive pricing environment and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business higher raw material costs and transition costs related to restructuring actions in 2006 these initiatives were partially offset by stock option expense 

 

operating income for all three years reflected restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2007 operating income included a reversal of a portion of an accrual related to a lawsuit in 2006 operating income included a gain on sale of assets legal fees related to a lawsuit and lease cancellation charges in 2005 operating income included an accrual related to a lawsuit net of a gain on sale of assets

operating income 

 

operating loss in 2007 reflected transition costs and integrationrelated asset impairment charges associated with the paxar acquisition amortization of acquisition intangibles and higher expenses due to investments for growth in asia including higher employeerelated costs higher operating costs were partially offset by higher sales and savings from restructuring and productivity initiatives 

 

in 2006 operating income benefited from productivity improvement actions including the migration of production from hong kong to lower cost facilities in mainland china benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by increased spending for information systems stock option expense and other incremental employeerelated costs in 2006 

 

operating income included integrationrelated software impairment charges in 2007 restructuring costs asset impairment and lease cancellation charges were incurred in all three years 

office and consumer products segment

on an organic basis sales declined approximately 7 in 2007 the decline reflected customer inventory reductions resulting in part from a volume shift to the fourth quarter of 2006 in advance of january 2007 selling price increases for certain product lines the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin business and a weaker backtoschool season compared to the prior year 

 

in 2006 sales on an organic basis declined 1 reflecting the loss of sales from exiting certain lowmargin private label business at the end of 2005 approximately 22 million partially offset by growth in averybrand products a strong backtoschool season in north america and accelerated purchases by customers in late 2006 in advance of our 2007 selling price increases for certain product lines

cash flow used in financing activities 

 

 

 

borrowings and repayment of debt 

 

at year end 2007 our borrowings outstanding under foreign shortterm lines of credit were 701 million weightedaverage interest rate of 106 compared to 1015 million at year end 2006 weightedaverage interest rate of 96 

 

shortterm variable rate commercial paper borrowings were 9902 million at december 29 2007 weightedaverage interest rate of 52 compared to 1544 million at december 30 2006 weightedaverage interest rate of 50 during 2007 we increased our shortterm borrowings to initially fund the paxar acquisition as noted above in “ payments for acquisitions ” as well as to support share repurchases the change in outstanding commercial paper also reflects positive cash flow from operations 

 

we had mediumterm notes of 100 million outstanding at year end 2007 compared to 160 million at year end 2006 in 2007 mediumterm notes of 60 million were paid on maturity outstanding mediumterm notes have maturities from 2008 through 2025 and accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from 59 to 76 

 

in september 2007 one of our subsidiaries issued 250 million 10year senior notes which we guaranteed bearing interest at a rate of 6625 per year due october 2017 the net proceeds from the offering were approximately 247 million and were used to pay down current longterm debt maturities of 150 million and reduce commercial paper borrowings of 97 million initially used to finance the paxar acquisition 

 

in november 2007 we issued 400 million of 7875 corporate himeds units a mandatory convertible debt issue an additional 40 million of himeds units were issued in december 2007 as a result of the exercise of the overallotment allocation from the initial issuance each himeds unit is comprised of two components — a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase from us a certain number of shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 68 million to approximately 86 million shares depending on the stock price at that time and a senior note due in 2020 the net proceeds from the offering were approximately 427 million which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the paxar acquisition

share repurchases 

 

on october 26 2006 the board of directors authorized the company to purchase an additional 5 million shares of the company’s stock under our existing stock repurchase program resulting in a total authorization of approximately 74 million shares of the company’s stock at that date we repurchased approximately 8 million and 25 million shares in 2007 and 2006 respectively cash payments for these repurchased shares were approximately 

63 million and approximately 158 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively included in the 2007 cash payments were approximately 11 million related to shares repurchased in 2006 but settled in 2007 as of december 29 2007 approximately 41 million shares were available for repurchase under the board of directors’ authorization

analysis of selected balance sheet accounts 

 

longlived assets 

 

goodwill increased 967 million during 2007 primarily due to our preliminary valuation of goodwill associated with the paxar acquisition completed in june 2007 931 million buyouts of minority interest shareholders 4 million associated with certain subsidiaries of rvl packaging inc and paxar and foreign currency translation 32 million partially offset by a tax adjustment related to a previous acquisition less than 1 million 

 

other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions increased approximately 219 million during 2007 due to our preliminary valuation of the intangible assets of the paxar acquisition 234 million and the impact of foreign currency translation 5 million partially offset by amortization expense 20 million 

 

refer to note 2 “acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

other assets increased approximately 63 million during 2007 due primarily to purchases of software and other deferred charges 64 million an increase in the cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance 17 million debt issuance costs associated with current year issuances 15 million increase in longterm pension assets 7 million increase in other assets 3 million and the impact of foreign currency translation 6 million partially offset by normal amortization of software and other deferred charges 31 million and software asset impairments 18 million 

 

other shareholders’ equity accounts 

 

the value of our employee stock benefit trust decreased 174 million in 2007 due to a decrease in the market value of shares held in the trust of approximately 120 million and the issuance of shares under our stock option and incentive plans of approximately 54 million 

 

accumulated other comprehensive income loss changed by approximately 135 million due to foreign currency translation approximately 106 million as well as the current year amortization and recognition of net pension transition obligation prior service cost and net actuarial loss approximately 29 million 

 

impact of foreign currency translation 

 

 

 

in 2007 international operations generated approximately 63 of our net sales our future results are subject to changes in political and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates 

 

the benefit to sales from currency translation in 2007 primarily reflected a benefit from sales denominated in euros as well as sales in the currencies of great britain australia brazil and china partially offset by a negative impact of sales in the currencies of south africa and hong kong 

 

translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies are included in net income in the period incurred operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years in 2007 we had no operations in hyperinflationary economies in 2006 the only hyperinflationary economy in which we operated was the dominican republic which uses the us dollar as the 

functional currency in 2005 our operations in hyperinflationary economies consisted of the dominican republic and turkey however the impact on net income from these operations was not significant 

 

effect of foreign currency transactions 

 

the impact on net income from transactions denominated in foreign currencies is mitigated because the costs of our products are generally denominated in the same currencies in which they are sold in addition to reduce our income statement exposure to transactions in foreign currencies we enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts where available and appropriate 

 

analysis of selected financial ratios 

 

we utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance as discussed below 

 

operational working capital ratio 

 

working capital current assets minus current liabilities excluding working capital of heldforsale businesses as a percent of net sales decreased in 2007 primarily due to an increase in shortterm debt 

 

on february 8 2008 one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement for a term loan credit facility with fourteen domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of 400 million maturing february 8 2011 the proceeds from this term loan credit facility were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings included in current liabilities initially used to finance the paxar acquisition 

 

operational working capital from continuing operations as a percent of net sales is a nongaap measure and is shown below we use this nongaap measure as a tool to assess our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing and other activities that affect cash and cash equivalents deferred taxes other current assets and other current liabilities that tend to be disparate in amount and timing and therefore may increase the volatility of the working capital ratio from period to period additionally the items excluded from this measure are not necessarily indicative of the underlying trends of our operations and are not significantly influenced by the daytoday activities that are managed at the operating level refer to “uses and limitations of nongaap measures” our objective is to minimize our investment in operational working capital as a percentage of sales by reducing this ratio to maximize cash flow and return on investment 

 

operational working capital from continuing operations 

 

 

as a percent of sales operational working capital from continuing operations in 2007 increased compared to 2006 the primary factors contributing to this change which includes the impact of currency translation are discussed below 

 

accounts receivable ratio 

 

the average number of days sales outstanding was 62 days in 2007 compared to 58 days in 2006 calculated using a fourquarter average accounts receivable balance divided by the average daily sales for the year the change is primarily due to the acquisition of paxar as well as the timing of sales and collections 

 

inventory ratio 

 

average inventory turnover was 78 in 2007 compared to 81 in 2006 calculated using the annual cost of sales divided by a fourquarter average inventory balance the change is primarily due to the acquisition of paxar 

 

accounts payable ratio 

 

the average number of days payable outstanding was 58 days in 2007 compared to 61 days in 2006 calculated using a fourquarter average accounts payable balance divided by the average daily cost of products sold for the year the change is primarily due to the timing of payments in europe partially offset by the acquisition of paxar 

 

debt ratios 

 

 

 

the increase in the total debt to total capital ratio in 2007 was primarily due to a net increase in debt related to the paxar acquisition and share repurchases partially offset by an increase in shareholders’ equity 

 

our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of income we were in compliance with these covenants as shown in the table above 

 

the fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities at year end the fair value of our total debt including shortterm borrowings was 22507 million in 2007 and 963 million in 2006 

 

shareholders’ equity ratios 

 

 

 

decreases in these ratios in 2007 compared to 2006 were primarily due to lower net income as well as higher equity and total debt outstanding these ratios are computed using actual net income and a fivequarter average denominator for equity and total debt accounts 

 

capital resources 

 

capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt financing we maintain adequate financing arrangements at competitive rates these financing arrangements consist of our commercial paper programs in the 

us and europe committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit in the countries where we operate callable commercial notes and longterm debt including mediumterm notes 

 

capital from debt 

 

our total debt increased approximately 129 billion in 2007 to 226 billion compared to year end 2006 reflecting increased shortterm borrowings primarily related to the paxar acquisition during the second quarter of 2007 and share repurchases 

 

we initially funded the paxar acquisition by issuing commercial paper supported by a bridge revolving credit facility the “credit facility” we entered into in june 2007 with five domestic and foreign banks the credit facility had an initial total commitment of 135 billion expiring june 11 2008 for terms which are generally similar to existing credit facilities financing available under this agreement is permitted to be used for working capital commercial paper backup and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions as of december 29 2007 the outstanding commitment was 715 million 

 

in august 2007 we amended our existing revolving credit agreement increasing commitments from 525 million to 1 billion and extending the maturity to august 2012 commitments were provided by twelve domestic and foreign banks financing available under the agreement will be used as a commercial paper backup facility and is also available to finance other corporate requirements including acquisitions 

 

in september 2007 one of our subsidiaries issued 250 million 10year senior notes which we guaranteed bearing interest at a rate of 6625 per year due october 2017 the net proceeds from the offering were approximately 247 million and were used to pay down current longterm debt maturities of 150 million and reduce commercial paper borrowings of 97 million initially used to finance the paxar acquisition 

 

the credit facility and the revolving credit agreement are subject to customary financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio with which we are in compliance 

 

in november 2007 we issued 400 million of 7875 corporate himeds units a mandatory convertible debt issue an additional 40 million of himeds units were issued in december 2007 as a result of the exercise of the overallotment allocation from the initial issuance each himeds unit is comprised of two components — a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase from us a certain number of shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 68 million to approximately 86 million shares depending on the stock price at that time and a senior note due in 2020 the net proceeds from the offering were approximately 427 million which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the paxar acquisition 

 

in addition we have a 364day revolving credit facility in which a foreign bank provides us up to euro 40 million 575 million in borrowings through july 31 2008 with the approval of the bank we may extend the revolving period and due date on an annual basis financing under this agreement is used to finance cash requirements of our european operations there was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of december 29 2007 and 263 million outstanding as of december 30 2006 

 

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of 809 million including 73 million of standby letters of credit we assumed from paxar and 771 million at the end of 2007 and 2006 respectively the aggregate contract amount of outstanding standby letters of credit approximated fair value 

 

in connection with the paxar acquisition we have assumed additional debt of approximately 5 million which remains outstanding at december 29 2007 

 

our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately 4482 million at year end 2007 our uncommitted lines of credit do not have a commitment expiration date and may be cancelled by the banks or us at any time 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to permit the issuance of debt and equity securities proceeds from the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing existing debt and for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions this shelf registration replaced the shelf registration statement filed in 2004 the himeds units discussed above were issued under this registration statement 

as discussed above one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement on february 8 2008 for a term loan credit facility with fourteen domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of 400 million maturing february 8 2011 the proceeds from this term loan credit facility were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the paxar acquisition 

 

credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings when determining a credit rating the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position business outlook consistency of cash flows debt level and liquidity geographic dispersion and management team 

 

our credit ratings as of year end 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

as of december 29 2007 our ratings were under review due to the recent acquisition of paxar sp and moody’s lowered our longterm rating from a to bbb and a3 to baa1 respectively due to the incremental debt incurred as a result of the paxar acquisition we remain committed to retaining a solid investment grade rating 

 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

contractual obligations at year end 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

we enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and transportation the terms of our leases do not impose significant restrictions or unusual obligations except for the facility in mentor ohio as noted below the table above includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms of one year or more 

 

on september 9 2005 we completed the lease financing for a commercial facility the “facility” located in mentor ohio used primarily for the new headquarters and research center for our roll materials group the facility consists generally of land buildings equipment and office furnishings we have leased the facility under an operating lease arrangement which contains a residual value guarantee of 334 million we do not expect the residual value of the facility to be less than the amount guaranteed 

 

we did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year end 2007 in the table of contractual obligations above because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems 

the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 125 million the timing of which is uncertain except for approximately 7 million that may become payable during 2008 refer to note 11 “taxes based on income” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on unrecognized tax benefits 

 

investigations and legal proceedings 

 

we previously announced that we had been notified by the european commission the united states department of justice “doj” the competition law department of the department of justice of canada and the australian competition and consumer commission of their respective criminal investigations into competitive practices in the label stock industry we cooperated with all of these investigations and all except the australian investigation which is continuing have been terminated without further action by the authorities 

 

we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation 

 

we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could be adverse and material these and other matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements 

 

environmental 

 

we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at eighteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites including paxar sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

 

we have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

 

as of december 29 2007 our estimated liability associated with compliance and remediation costs was approximately 38 million including preliminary liabilities related to the acquisition of paxar see also note 2 “acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements 

 

during 2006 we recognized 15 million for estimated environmental remediation costs for a former operating facility of the amount accrued which represented the lower end of the current estimated range of 15 million to 17 million for costs expected to be incurred approximately 9 million remained accrued as of december 29 2007 we considered additional information provided by outside consultants in revising our previous estimates of expected costs this estimate could change depending on various factors such as modification of currently planned remedial actions changes in site conditions a change in the estimated time to complete remediation changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and other factors 

 

other amounts currently accrued are not significant to our consolidated financial position and based upon current information we believe that it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

other 

 

in 2005 we contacted relevant authorities in the us and reported on the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of our reflective business in china and involved among other things impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments the payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration corrective and disciplinary 

actions have been taken sales of our reflective business in china in 2005 were approximately 7 million based on findings to date no changes to our previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result of these matters however we believe that fines or other penalties could be incurred while we are unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties we believe that our behavior in detecting investigating responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably 

 

we and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of our business based upon current information we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us 

 

we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized these costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary 

 

we participate in international receivable financing programs with several financial institutions whereby advances may be requested from these financial institutions such advances are guaranteed by us at december 29 2007 we had guaranteed approximately 17 million 

 

as of december 29 2007 we guaranteed up to approximately 22 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries’ obligations to their suppliers as well as approximately 476 million of certain of our subsidiaries’ lines of credit with various financial institutions 

 

in november 2007 we issued 400 million of 7875 corporate himeds units a mandatory convertible debt issue an additional 40 million of himeds units were issued in december 2007 as a result of the exercise of the overallotment allocation from the initial issuance each himeds unit is comprised of two components — a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase from us a certain number of shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 68 million to approximately 86 million shares depending on the stock price at that time and a senior note due in 2020 the net proceeds from the offering were approximately 427 million which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the paxar acquisition 

 

uses and limitations of nongaap measures 

 

we use certain nongaap financial measures that exclude the impact of certain events activities or strategic decisions the accounting effects of these events activities or decisions which are included in the gaap measures may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the company in a single period by excluding certain accounting effects both positive and negative eg gains on sales of assets restructuring charges asset impairments etc from certain of our gaap measures management believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the company’s “core” or “underlying” operating results these nongaap measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying business as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period 

 

limitations associated with the use of our nongaap measures include 1 the exclusion of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from the calculation of organic sales growth 2 the exclusion of mandatory debt service requirements as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business such as discretionary debt reductions dividends share repurchase acquisitions etc for calculation of free cash flow and 3 the exclusion of cash and cash equivalents shortterm debt deferred taxes and other current assets and other current liabilities as well as current assets and current liabilities of heldforsale businesses for the calculation of operational working capital while some of the items the company excludes from gaap measures recur these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts we believe that supplemental nongaap measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the company’s performance and operating trends 

related party transactions 

 

from time to time we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties we believe that such transactions are at arm’s length and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 

 

one of our directors peter w mullin is the chairman chief executive officer and a director of mc insurance services inc “mc” mullin insurance services inc “minc” and pwm insurance services inc “pwm” executive compensation and benefit consultants and insurance agents mr mullin is also the majority stockholder of mc minc and pwm collectively referred to as the “mullin companies” we paid premiums to insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the mullin companies in connection with various of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies have advised us that they earned commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and renewal of this insurance approximately 50 of these commissions were allocated to and used by mullintbg insurance agency services llc an affiliate of mc to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statements to participants under various of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies own a minority interest in m financial holdings inc “mfh” substantially all of the life insurance policies which we placed through the mullin companies in 2007 and prior years are issued by insurance carriers that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance carriers and m life insurance company “m life” a whollyowned subsidiary of mfh reinsurance returns earned by m life are determined annually by the insurance carriers and can be negative or positive depending upon the results of m life’s aggregate reinsurance pool which consists of the insured lives reinsured by m life the mullin companies have advised us that they participated in net reinsurance gains of m life in addition the mullin companies have advised us that they also participated in net reinsurance gains of m life that are subject to risk of forfeiture none of these transactions were significant to our financial position or results of operations 

 

summary of related party activity 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense actual results could differ from those estimates 

 

critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require us to make difficult subjective andor complex judgments critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown we believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition sales returns and allowances accounts receivable allowances inventory and inventory reserves longlived asset impairments pensions and postretirement benefits income taxes stockbased compensation restructuring and severance costs litigation and environmental and business combinations 

revenue recognition 

 

sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists pricing is determinable and collection is reasonably assured furthermore sales provisions for estimated returns and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers and when the customers assume the risks and rewards of ownership sales terms are generally fob free on board shipping point or fob destination depending upon local business customs for most regions in which we operate fob shipping point terms are utilized and sales are recorded at the time of shipment because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred in certain regions notably in europe fob destination terms are generally utilized and sales are recorded when the products are delivered to the customer’s delivery site because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances 

 

sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate volume promotional price cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products we review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available 

 

sales returns and allowances 

 

sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our customers both affiliated and nonaffiliated for the return of unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of return we accrue for returns and allowances based upon the gross price of the products sold and historical experience for such products we record these allowances based on the following factors i customer specific allowances and ii an estimated amount based on our historical experience for issues not yet identified 

 

accounts receivable allowances 

 

we are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy historical experience and future expectations the allowances for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value we record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount based on our historical experience for issues not yet identified no single customer represented 10 or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2007 and 2006 however our ten largest customers at year end 2007 represented approximately 17 of trade accounts receivable and consisted of six customers of our office and consumer products segment three customers of our pressuresensitive materials segment and one customer of both these segments the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 

 

inventory and inventory reserves 

 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials workinprogress or finished goods beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 we changed the method of accounting for inventories for our us operations from a combination of the use of fifo and lifo methods to the fifo method the inventories for our international operations continue to be valued using the fifo method we believe this change is preferable as the fifo method better reflects the current value of inventories on the consolidated balance sheet provides better matching of revenue and expense in the consolidated statement of income provides uniformity across our operations with respect to the method for inventory accounting and enhances comparability with peers furthermore this application of the fifo method will be consistent with our accounting of inventories for us income tax purposes 

 

the change in accounting method from lifo to fifo method was completed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” we applied this change in accounting principle by retrospectively restating prior years’ financial statements refer to the financial 

presentation and inventories sections of note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

inventory reserves are recorded for damaged obsolete excess and slowmoving inventory we use estimates to record these reserves slowmoving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 

 

longlived asset impairments 

 

we record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of longlived assets are determined not to be recoverable impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value fair value is typically determined using quoted market prices if available or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition the key estimates applied when preparing cash flow projections relate to revenues gross margins economic life of assets overheads taxation and discount rates the amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our longlived assets 

 

pensions and postretirement benefits 

 

in december 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” 

 

  

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries in the event we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return or health care costs future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost 

 

discount rate 

 

we in consultation with our actuaries annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our postretirement obligations the assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available in the us our discount rate is determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds the projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans 

 

longterm return on assets 

 

we determine the longterm rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets taking into consideration that assets with higher volatility 

typically generate a greater return over the long run additionally current market conditions such as interest rates are evaluated and peer data is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness 

 

healthcare cost trend rate 

 

our practice is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits on a cash basis for measurement purposes an 8 annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2008 this rate is expected to decrease to approximately 5 by 2011 

 

income taxes 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

 

pursuant to sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” sfas no 109 defines a tax planning strategy as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination we have also acquired certain net deferred tax assets with existing valuation allowances if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized we will release the valuation allowance to current earnings or adjust the purchase price allocation consistent with the manner of origination 

 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 

 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time pursuant to financial interpretation no 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 requires a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to fin 48 and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

effective january 1 2006 we began recognizing expense for stockbased compensation to comply with the provisions of the reissued sfas no 123r using the modified prospective application transition method as permitted by this transition method results for the prior periods have not been restated in addition we continued to recognize compensation cost related to outstanding unvested awards as of december 31 2005 under the original provisions of sfas no 123 stockbased compensation expense for all awards granted after december 31 2005 was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 123r 

 

valuation of stock options 

 

our stockbased compensation expense is the estimated fair value of options granted amortized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period the fair value of each of our stock option awards is estimated on the date 

of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model this model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options 

 

expected dividend yield was based on the current annual dividend divided by the 12month average of our monthly stock price prior to grant 

 

expected volatility for options granted during 2007 represented an average of implied and historical volatility expected volatility for options granted prior to 2006 was based on historical volatility of our stock price 

 

riskfree rate was based on the average of the 52week average of the treasurybond rate that has a term corresponding to the expected option term 

 

expected term was determined based on historical experience under our stock option plans 

 

forfeiture rate assumption was determined based on historical data of our stock option forfeitures over the last twelve years prior to 2007 

 

certain of the assumptions used above are based on management’s estimates as such if factors change and such factors require us to change our assumptions and estimates our stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different in the future 

 

we have not capitalized costs associated with stockbased compensation 

 

accounting for income taxes for stockbased compensation 

 

we elected to use the shortcut method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits related to employee stockbased compensation awards in addition we elected to follow the tax ordering laws to determine the sequence in which deductions and net operating loss carryforwards are utilized as well as the directonly approach to calculating the amount of windfall or shortfall tax benefits 

 

restructuring and severance costs 

 

we account for restructuring costs including severance and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the guidance provided in sfas no 112 “accounting for postemployment benefits” and sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” in the us we have a severance pay plan “pay plan” which provides eligible employees with severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination due to qualifying cost reduction actions we calculate severance pay using the severance benefit formula under the pay plan accordingly we record provisions for such amounts and other related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set forth under sfas no 112 in the absence of a pay plan or established local practices for overseas jurisdictions liability for severance and other employeerelated costs is recognized when the liability is incurred following the guidance of sfas no 146 

 

litigation and environmental 

 

we are currently involved in various lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of our business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated the best estimate within the range or if an amount cannot be determined and be the most likely the low end of the range is accrued the ultimate resolution of these claims could affect future results of operations should our exposure be materially different from our earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously accrued 

 

environmental expenditures are generally expensed however environmental expenditures for newly acquired assets and those which extend or improve the economic useful life of existing assets are capitalized and amortized over the remaining asset life we review each reporting period our estimates of costs of compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of various sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us a potentially responsible party when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated the best estimate within the range or if 

an amount cannot be determined and be the most likely the low end of the range is accrued potential insurance reimbursements are not offset against potential liabilities and such liabilities are not discounted 

 

business combinations 

 

we account for business combinations using the accounting requirements of sfas no 141 “business combinations” in accordance with sfas no 141 we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from acquired businesses at fair value and we make estimates and assumptions to determine such fair values we engage thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in determining these fair value estimates 

 

we utilize a variety of assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable in determining fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed these assumptions and estimates include estimated future cash flows growth rates current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain assets market rate assumptions for certain obligations and certain potential costs of compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of acquired properties we also utilize information obtained from management of the acquired businesses and our own historical experience from previous acquisitions 

 

we apply significant assumptions and estimates in determining certain intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions such as customer relationships patents and other acquired technology and trademarks and trade names and related applicable useful lives property plant and equipment receivables inventories investments tax accounts environmental liabilities stock option awards lease commitments and restructuring and integration costs unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results as such decreases to fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including cost estimates for certain obligations and liabilities are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period generally within one year of the acquisition date and as operating expenses thereafter 

 

recent accounting requirements 

 

during 2007 we adopted certain accounting and financial disclosure requirements of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” emerging issues task force “eitf” and financial interpretations by the staff of the fasb in 2006 the requirements with the most significant impact were the reissued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” refer to note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

safe harbor statement

certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in part i item 1a “risk factors” to the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 29 2007 and include but are not limited to risks and uncertainties relating to investment in development activities and new production facilities fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials ability of the company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions including synergies from the integration of the paxar business in the time and the cost anticipated ability of the company to generate sustained productivity improvement successful integration of acquisitions successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment the financial 

condition and inventory strategies of customers customer and supplier concentrations changes in customer order patterns loss of significant contracts or customers timely development and market acceptance of new products impact of competitive products and pricing selling prices business mix shift credit risks ability of the company to obtain adequate financing arrangements fluctuation of interest rates fluctuation in pension insurance and employee benefit costs impact of legal proceedings including the australian competition and consumer commission investigation into industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to this investigation or to the subject matter thereof or of the concluded investigations by the doj the ec and the canadian department of justice including purported class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation as well as the impact of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act based on issues in china changes in governmental regulations changes in political conditions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations worldwide and local economic conditions impact of epidemiological events on the economy and the company’s customers and suppliers acts of war terrorism natural disasters and other factors

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

risk management 

 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

 

our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes 

 

our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes as a result we enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets liabilities firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs when available and appropriate the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 

 

our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve our objectives we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings in june 2007 and august 2007 we entered into certain interest rate option contracts to hedge our exposure related to interest rate increases in connection with our anticipated longterm debt issuances such debt issuances were intended to replace the shortterm borrowings initially used to finance the paxar acquisition and to support the refinancing of our current longterm debt maturities in connection with these transactions we paid 115 million as option premiums of which 48 million was recognized during the year as a cash flow hedge loss in the consolidated statement of income and 67 million is being amortized over the life of the related forecasted hedged transactions 

 

additionally we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations these amounts are not material to our financial statements 

in the normal course of operations we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions other risks associated with foreign operations commodity price risk and litigation risk which are not represented in the analyses that follow 

 

foreign exchange valueatrisk 

 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions firm commitments accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were included in the model forecasted transactions which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model the var was estimated using a variancecovariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on twoyear historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks a 95 confidence level was used for a oneday time horizon 

 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately 3 million at year end 2007 

 

interest rate sensitivity 

 

an assumed 50 basis point move in interest rates 10 of our weightedaverage interest rate on floating rate debt affecting our variablerate borrowings would have had an estimated 5 million effect on our 2007 earnings

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f of the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on that evaluation the company’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 29 2007 see management’s report on internal control over financial reporting on page 76 in the company’s 2007 annual report to shareholders 

 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2007 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report of independent registered public accounting firm on page 77 in the company’s 2007 annual report to shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference management has excluded paxar corporation from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2007 because it was acquired by the company in a purchase business combination during 2007 pricewaterhousecoopers llp has also excluded paxar corporation from their audit of internal control over financial reporting paxar corporation is a whollyowned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 9 percent and 8 percent respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 29 2007 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2006 the company implemented an upgrade to its financial reporting and consolidation system and installed new finance and accounting software for its retail information services business in asia the company reviewed both systems as they were being implemented as well as the internal controls affected by the implementation where appropriate the company made changes to affected internal controls 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2006 the company outsourced certain of its shared service functions for accounts receivable accounts payable and general ledger accounting to a thirdparty service provider as part of the transition process the company reviewed the related internal controls and determined that the design of the controls surrounding these processes satisfies the control objectives of the company where appropriate the company made changes to affected internal controls the company also tested the operating effectiveness of the controls and determined that they were operating effectively 

 

in connection with the acquisition of paxar the company has performed certain due diligence procedures related to paxar’s financial reporting and disclosure controls as part of the ongoing integration the company continues to assess the overall control environment of this business 

 

except for these changes there have been no changes in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal controls over financial reporting the company believes that its internal controls as modified were operating effectively as of december 29 2007

 item 1 business tableend   avery dennison corporation “avery dennison” the “company” “registrant” “issuer” which may be referred to as “we” or “us” was incorporated in 1977 in the state of delaware as avery international corporation the successor corporation to a california corporation of the same name which was incorporated in 1946 in 1990 the company merged one of its subsidiaries into dennison manufacturing company “dennison” as a result of which dennison became a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and in connection with which company’s name was changed to avery dennison corporation our homepage on the internet is wwwaverydennisoncom and you can learn more about us by visiting our web site our web site address provided in this annual report on form 10k is not intended to function as a hyperlink and the information on our web site is not and should not be considered part of this report and is not incorporated by reference in this document 

  our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials office products and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are “converted” into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting and some are sold in unconverted form as base materials tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of office products and other converted products and other items not involving pressuresensitive components such as binders organizing systems markers fasteners business forms as well as tickets tags and imprinting equipment for retail and apparel manufacturers 

  a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

  selfadhesive materials may initially cost more than materials using heat or moisture activated adhesives but the use of selfadhesive materials often provides cost savings because of their easy and instant application without the need for adhesive activation they also provide consistent and versatile adhesion with minimal adhesive deterioration and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape and color

other matters 

  we use various raw materials primarily paper plastic films and resins and specialty chemicals which we purchase from a variety of commercial and industrial sources and which are subject to price fluctuations although from time to time shortages could occur these raw materials currently are generally available 

  we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic compounds which can be regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments we continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions 

  a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled would be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments in connection with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions 

  we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in our facilities in peachtree city georgia fort wayne and greenfield indiana and quakertown pennsylvania as well as in other plants in the united states argentina australia belgium brazil canada china colombia france germany india korea luxembourg malaysia mexico the netherlands south africa thailand and united kingdom 

  based on current information we do not believe that the costs of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend   our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks including but not limited to the following 

the demand for our products is impacted by economic conditions of the principal countries in which we operate a decline in the economies in these countries could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

  we have operations in over 40 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in the political social economic tax and regulatory environments including tariffs in the countries in which we operate as well as the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for our products in addition approximately 55 of our sales are in foreign currencies which fluctuate in relation to one another and to the united states dollar fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction translation and other losses to us which can negatively impact our sales and profitability 

5 we operate in some highly competitive markets if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share and experience falling prices adversely affecting our financial results 

  we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key markets and implement new technologies making them more competitive there is also the possibility that competitors will be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

  we are also at risk with regards to changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes changes in the company’s incentive programs or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are also dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and the ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor 

  inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to recur and our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on to customers changes in costs in our selling prices for products and on improvements in productivity also it is important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and packaging from suppliers a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and investigations regarding competitive activities and other legal compliance and regulatory matters including those involving product liability product and trade compliance foreign corrupt practices act issues and other matters could impact us materially 

  our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations including without limitation any relating to the canadian department of justice and australian competition and consumer commission investigations into industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter thereof including purported class actions in the united states seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices and a purported class action related to alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the recently closed us department of justice investigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

our future results may be affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

  we are undergoing efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations including closure of facilities headcount reductions organizational simplification process standardization and using a variety of tools such as lean sigma and kaizen events to accomplish this productivity which is not assured lower levels of productivity could result in lower production sales and profitability cost reduction actions in turn could expose us to additional production risk 

slower growth in key markets could adversely affect our profitability 

  our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key end use markets or applications for our products our overall performance will be influenced by these markets 

our customers are widely diversified but in certain portions of our business industry concentration has increased the importance and decreased the number of significant customers 

  in particular sales of our office and consumer products in the united states are concentrated in a few major customers principally office product superstores mass market distributors and wholesalers the 

6 business risk associated with this concentration including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt writeoffs could negatively affect our margins and profits 

our ability to develop and successfully market new products and applications is important in maintaining growth 

  the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers 

infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents could harm our ability to grow 

  because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are sometimes involved in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be held to be liable to pay damages or obtain licenses there can be no assurance that licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms and the cost to defend these infringement claims and to develop new technology could be significant 

  we also could have our intellectual property infringed we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information but it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information and develop similar technologies in addition many of the countries in which we operate have limited or no protection for intellectual property rights the costs involved to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our profitability 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

  our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results 

we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances 

  if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse effect on our future operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may also change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings in future periods 

  assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries funding obligations are determined under the employee retirement income security act and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement 

7 liability and related costs future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments could be affected by legislation enacted in the us congress 

we have acquired companies and our interest in various acquisition opportunities has increased acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including integration technology and personnel 

  in order to grow our product lines and expand into new markets we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future many risks uncertainties and costs are associated with the acquisitions the integration of systems objectives personnel product lines markets customers suppliers and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results are uncertain there can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability 

in order for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees 

  there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to rapid expansion in certain markets and the ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions it may be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees 

we need to comply with many environmental health and safety laws 

  due to the nature of our business we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes compliance with existing and future environmental health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities and generally impact our financial performance we have accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup sites including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

in order to mitigate risk it is important that we obtain various types of insurance 

  we have various types of insurance including health life and property insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results 

significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our operations sales customer relations and financial results 

  we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to damage or interruptions caused by natural disasters power failures viruses and security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly could cause significant disruptions we have implemented various measures to manage our risk related to system and network disruptions but if a disruption occurs we could incur losses and costs for remediation and interruption of operations 

our share price may be volatile 

  our stock price is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including market expectations for our performance the level of perceived growth of our industries announcements concerning industry investigations have also impacted our share price there can be no assurance that our stock price will not be less volatile in the future 

if our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing from capital markets 

  credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings standard 

8 and poor’s “sp” has assigned us a credit rating of a2 for shortterm and a for longterm financing sp has given us a negative outlook moody’s investors service “moody’s” has assigned us a credit rating of p2 for shortterm and a3 for longterm financing moody’s has given us a stable outlook if our credit ratings were to be downgraded our financial flexibility would decrease and the cost to borrow would increase 

our reputation sales and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 

  there are occasions when we ship products with quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping but this causes delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when the issues are discovered after shipment this causes additional shipping costs possible discounts possible refunds and potential loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues can result in financial consequences along with a negative impact on our reputation 

some of our products are sold by third parties 

  our products are not only sold by us but by third party distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of these third parties could affect our sales and profitability 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

  we manufacture most of our products but occasionally thirdparty manufacturers are needed for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to control product failure late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality problems and customer dissatisfaction outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  the risks described above are not exclusive additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be less significant may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the above risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed the company is participating with other prps at all such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

  the company has accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

  during the third quarter of 2006 the company recognized an additional liability of 13 million for estimated environmental remediation costs for a former operating facility for which 2 million had been accrued in the second quarter of 2006 the amount accrued represents the lower end of the current estimated range of 15 million to 17 million for costs expected to be incurred management considered additional information provided by outside consultants in revising its previous estimates of expected costs this estimate could change depending on various factors such as modification of currently planned remedial actions changes in the site conditions changes in the estimated time to complete remediation changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and other factors

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tableend   management’s discussion and analysis provides a narrative concerning our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements it includes the following sections 

 definition of terms 

  our discussion of financial results includes several nongaap measures to provide additional information concerning avery dennison corporation’s “the company’s” performance these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with nor are they a substitute for gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are intended to supplement the presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with gaap refer to “uses and limitations of nongaap measures” 

  we use the following terms 

   while our segment structure remained the same as reported in the prior year in 2006 we transferred our business media division from the retail information services segment into other specialty converting businesses to align with a change in our internal reporting structure prior year amounts included herein have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

  as a result of the sale of our raised reflective pavement marker business during 2006 discussed below in “acquisitions and divestitures” the discussions which follow generally reflect summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise noted however the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations 

17 overview and outlook 

overview 

   our sales from continuing operations increased 2 in 2006 compared to growth of 3 in 2005 reflecting the factors summarized in the following table 

   organic sales growth in 2006 reflected increases in most of our businesses outside of the us particularly in the emerging markets of asia eastern europe and latin america 

  in the us sales were approximately even with the prior year in our north american roll materials business reduced market share during the first quarter of 2006 reflecting share loss related to price increases implemented in 2005 and early 2006 to offset higher raw material costs as well as generally slow market conditions were offset by some share gain during the second half of 2006 the benefit from growth of averybrand products and a strong backtoschool season in our office and consumer products segment in the us was offset by the loss of sales from exiting certain lowmargin private label business in that segment 

  organic sales growth in 2005 reflected favorable changes in pricing and product mix primarily due to the impact of selling price increases implemented to offset higher raw material costs this benefit was partially offset by a decrease in core unit volume in 2005 reflecting the following factors 

 

   net income increased 141 million in 2006 compared to 2005 

positive factors affecting the change in net income included 

 18 negative factors affecting the change in net income included 

 summary results by segment 

 pressuresensitive materials 58 of net sales 

  our pressuresensitive materials segment reported a 4 increase in sales in 2006 compared to 2005 organic sales growth was approximately 3 reflecting growth in our roll materials and graphics and reflective businesses in asia europe and latin america 

  operating income for this segment increased 17 in 2006 reflecting higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives operating income for this segment included restructuring costs and asset impairments in both 2006 and 2005 and transition costs in 2006 

office and consumer products 19 of net sales 

  our office and consumer products segment reported a 6 decrease in sales in 2006 compared to 2005 on an organic basis sales declined approximately 1 reflecting the loss of sales from exiting certain lowmargin private label business and decreased volume in europe these declines were partially offset by growth in north america for averybrand products a strong backto school season and accelerated purchases by customers in advance of our 2007 selling price increases for certain product lines 

  operating income for this segment increased 7 in 2006 including the benefit from cost savings from productivity improvement and restructuring initiatives operating income for this segment included restructuring costs asset impairments and transition costs in both 2006 and 2005 

retail information services 12 of net sales 

  the retail information services segment reported a 6 increase in sales in 2006 compared to 2005 organic sales growth was approximately 5 reflecting continued growth of the business in asia latin america and europe

19 other specialty converting businesses 11 of net sales 

  other specialty converting businesses reported a 1 increase in sales in 2006 compared to 2005 organic sales growth was approximately 2 reflecting solid growth in our specialty tape business partially offset by weakness in other businesses 

  operating income for these businesses increased 22 in 2006 reflecting sales growth and cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives operating income for these businesses included restructuring costs and asset impairments in both 2006 and 2005 

organic sales growth by region 

  we estimate organic sales growth decline in major regions of operation as follows 

   as discussed above sales in the us were approximately even with the prior year due to slow market conditions in our pressuresensitive materials segment the impact of prior year share loss in our roll materials business and loss of sales from exiting lowmargin private label business in our office and consumer products segment 

  organic growth in europe reflected strong growth in the east and modest growth in the west 

  growth in our asian and latin american businesses was due to continued market expansion 

cost reduction actions 

   during late 2005 and 2006 we implemented cost reduction actions related to restructuring which have improved our global operating efficiencies and are expected to result in annualized pretax savings of 90 million to 100 million we estimate that approximately 50 million of these savings net of transition costs were achieved in 2006 with the balance to benefit 2007 these restructuring actions resulted in headcount reductions of approximately 1150 positions which impacted all of our segments and geographic regions and were completed in 2006 we are reinvesting some of the savings in future growth opportunities 

  additional restructuring actions were identified during the fourth quarter of 2006 these actions are expected to be completed during 2007 with savings expected to benefit 2008 

  in 2005 we also incurred charges related to the planned divestitures of several lowmargin businesses and product lines as discussed in “divestitures and acquisitions” 

  restructuring charges associated with severance and asset impairments recorded during 2004 were related to the completion of the integration of the 2002 acquisition of jackstädt into our other existing businesses we closed a manufacturing facility in france during the first quarter of 2004 and a manufacturing facility in italy during the second quarter of 2004 

  refer to note 10 “cost reduction actions” to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

20 effective rate of taxes on income 

  the effective tax rate was 172 for the full year 2006 compared with 204 for the full year 2005 

our effective tax rate in both years included benefits from 

   in 2005 these benefits were partially offset by incremental expense associated with the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 

free cash flow 

  free cash flow which is a nongaap measure is used as a measure of funds available for other corporate purposes such as dividends debt reduction acquisitions and repurchase of common stock refer to “uses and limitations of nongaap measures” 

   the increase in free cash flow in 2006 of 62 million reflects changes in assets and liabilities and higher net income compared to 2005 see “analysis of results of operations” and “liquidity” below for more information 

divestitures and acquisitions 

  in december 2005 we announced our plan to sell our raised reflective pavement marker business which had sales of approximately 23 million in 2005 the divestiture of this business was completed during the second quarter of 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business the results of this business have been accounted for as discontinued operations for the years presented herein this business was previously included in the pressuresensitive materials segment 

  in december 2005 we also announced the divestiture of two product lines these divestitures were completed in the first quarter of 2006 the first product line which was included in the office and consumer products segment had estimated sales of 60 million in 2005 with minimal impact to income from operations the second product line which was included in other specialty converting businesses had annual sales of approximately 10 million in 2005 with minimal impact to income from operations as part of these divestitures in 2005 we recorded severance and other employeerelated charges of approximately 6 million and asset impairments of approximately 9 million these charges were included in the “other expense net” line of our consolidated statement of income as noted in “cost reduction actions” above 

  during the third quarter of 2004 we acquired rinke etiketten a privately held company in germany the incremental impact of this acquisition on our net sales was approximately 9 million during 2004 with an additional impact of approximately 18 million in 2005 this business is included in our retail information services segment 

21 investigations and legal proceedings 

  on october 19 2006 we were notified by the us department of justice’s antitrust division “doj” that the doj had decided to close its criminal investigation initiated in april 2003 into competitive practices in the label stock industry without further action 

  on november 15 2006 we announced that we had been notified by the european commission “ec” that the ec had closed its investigation initiated in may 2004 into competitive activities in the label stock industry with no action 

  in july 2004 we were notified by the competition law division of the department of justice of canada that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation in august 2005 we were notified by the australian competition and consumer commission that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation we are cooperating with these investigations 

  we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation we are also a named defendant in a purported class action in the us seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices we have discovered instances of conduct by certain employees in china that potentially violate the us foreign corrupt practices act and we have reported that conduct to authorities in the us accordingly we expect that fines or other penalties may be incurred 

  we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could be adverse and material these and other matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements 

outlook 

  in 2007 we expect low to mid singledigit revenue growth including a modest positive effect from foreign currency translation our revenue expectations are subject to changes in economic and market conditions 

  we anticipate continued benefit from our productivity improvement initiatives in particular we estimate that our restructuring and business realignment efforts will reduce costs by an additional 45 million compared to 2006 however we plan to reinvest some of the savings from these productivity improvements in growth initiatives this reinvestment includes incremental spending of approximately 12 million to 15 million related to investments in information technology 

  we estimate that pretax interest expense will be approximately even with 2006 subject to changes in average debt outstanding 

  we expect total restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2007 will be lower than the charges taken in 2006 

  we anticipate an increase in our annual effective tax rate for 2007 subject to changes in tax laws and the geographic mix of income with potentially wide variances from quarter to quarter 

  reflecting these assumptions we expect an increase in annual earnings and free cash flow in comparison with 2006 additionally the effect of share repurchase will benefit earnings per share in 2007 

  we expect capital expenditures in 2007 to be approximately 160 million to 165 million or approximately 210 million to 225 million including software investments funded through operating cash flows major capital projects in 2007 include expansion in china and india serving both our materials and retail information services businesses major software investments relate to customer service and standardization initiatives

  on an organic basis sales in the us were approximately even in 2006 compared to a decrease of approximately 3 in 2005 in our north american roll materials business reduced market share during the first quarter of 2006 reflecting share loss related to price increases implemented in 2005 and early 2006 to offset higher raw material costs as well as generally slow market conditions were offset by some share gain during the second half of 2006 the benefit from growth of averybrand products and a strong backto school season in our office and consumer products segment in the us was offset by the loss of sales from exiting certain lowmargin private label business approximate impact of 22 million in that segment 

  sales growth in 2005 was negatively impacted by an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year and accelerated purchases by office and consumer products customers in advance of 2005 selling price increases both of which contributed to higher growth in 2004 combined the accelerated purchases and extra week in 2004 represented an estimated 60 million to 70 million of the change in sales between 2005 and 2004 the loss of market share in our north american roll materials business also affected sales growth in 2005 

  foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately 21 million in 2006 compared to approximately 77 million in 2005 

  product line divestitures net of incremental sales from acquisitions reduced sales by approximately 54 million in 2006 incremental sales from acquisitions net of divestitures contributed approximately 19 million in 2005

23 in 2006 these benefits were partially offset by 

 in 2005 these benefits were partially offset by 

   in 2006 we reclassified shipping and handling costs to “cost of products sold” to align our businesses around a standard accounting policy in 2005 several of our businesses included these costs in marketing general and administrative expenses approximately 143 million for 2006 145 million for 2005 and 148 million for 2004 previous results included herein have been reclassified for comparability to the current year 

marketing general and administrative expenses 

  marketing general and administrative expense as a percent of sales in 2006 and 2005 reflected the benefit of productivity improvement initiatives and cost reduction actions 

in 2006 these benefits were offset by 

 in 2005 these benefits were offset by 

 interest expense 

  interest expense decreased in 2006 and 2005 the decreases were due to a reduction in debt outstanding partially offset by an increase in interest rates 

other expense 

 24   in 2006 and 2005 “other expense net” consisted of charges for restructuring including severance and other employeerelated costs and asset impairment charges related to cost reduction actions and divestitures as well as other items discussed below 

  during late 2005 and 2006 we implemented cost reduction actions related to restructuring which have improved our global operating efficiencies and are expected to result in annualized pretax savings of 90 million to 100 million we estimate that approximately 50 million of these savings net of transition costs have been achieved in 2006 these restructuring actions resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 1150 positions which impacted all of our segments and geographic regions and were completed in 2006 we are reinvesting some of the savings in future growth opportunities refer to note 10 “cost reduction actions” to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the other items included in “other expense net” in 2006 included 

   in 2005 other items included in “other expense net” consisted of the gain on the sale of assets partially offset by costs related to a patent lawsuit

 25   our 2005 effective tax rate included the benefit of changes in the geographic mix of income and continued improvements in our global tax structure as well as the following 

   in 2005 these benefits were partially offset by the incremental expense of 135 million associated with the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 

income loss from discontinued operations 

  income loss from discontinued operations includes the divestiture of our raised reflective pavement markers business as noted in the overview section above the divestiture of this business was completed during 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit 149 million due to capital losses arising from the sale of the business and a gain on sale of 13 million 

  based on our estimated value of the raised reflective pavement markers business in 2005 we concluded that associated goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition of this business were impaired the resulting pretax impairment charge was approximately 74 million in 2005 

  income from discontinued operations included net sales of approximately 7 million in 2006 23 million in 2005 and 24 million in 2004

  sales in our pressuresensitive materials segment increased 4 in both 2006 and 2005 organic sales growth was approximately 3 in 2006 and 2 in 2005 

  organic sales growth in 2006 reflected growth in our roll materials and graphics and reflective businesses in asia latin america and europe organic growth in 2005 reflected the positive impact of pricing and product mix resulting from increased selling prices implemented to offset higher raw material costs the extra week in the 2004 fiscal year contributed to slower growth in 2005 

  in our north american roll materials business 2005 sales declined on an organic basis at a low singledigit rate while 2006 sales were even with the prior year the loss of market share following our implementation of selling price increases in 2005 and early 2006 contributed to this decline both years were also affected by generally slow market conditions some share gain during the second half of 2006 offset these factors 

26   our roll materials business in europe experienced low singledigit organic sales growth in 2006 reflecting strong growth in the east in 2005 this business experienced high singledigit organic sales growth reflecting solid growth in the west and stronger growth in the east 

  market expansion contributed to doubledigit organic sales growth in the roll materials business in asia in both 2006 and 2005 the roll materials business in latin america experienced high singledigit organic sales growth in 2006 resulting from market expansion in 2005 this region experienced low singledigit organic sales growth due to market expansion and selling price increases partially offset by loss of market share from selling price increases and loss of sales with a large customer 

  our graphics and reflective business experienced mid singledigit organic sales growth in 2006 as strong international growth was partially offset by a decline in the us on an organic basis sales in this business were unchanged in 2005

office and consumer products segment 

 

   sales in our office and consumer products segment decreased 6 in 2006 while sales decreased 3 in 2005 the decline in reported sales in 2006 reflected the impact of a product line divestiture in europe approximately 51 million foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in reported sales of approximately 1 million in 2006 and 8 million in 2005 

  on an organic basis sales declined approximately 1 in 2006 the decline reflected the loss of sales from exiting certain lowmargin private label business at the end of 2005 approximately 22 million partially offset by growth in averybrand products a strong backtoschool season in north america and accelerated purchases by customers in late 2006 in advance of our 2007 selling price increases for certain product lines 

  in 2005 sales on an organic basis declined 4 reflecting a shift in volume to late 2004 due to customers’ accelerated purchases in advance of selling price increases effective january 1 2005 as well as the benefit from an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year declines in core unit volume in 2005 were partially offset by increased selling prices implemented to offset higher raw material costs 

   operating income in 2006 reflected cost savings from productivity improvement and restructuring actions partially offset by associated transition costs higher raw material and energyrelated costs increased marketing costs an increase in the lifo reserve and stock option expense 

  operating income in 2005 reflected charges related to restructuring asset impairment and net losses associated with product line divestitures partially offset by cost savings from restructuring and productivity initiatives the selling price increases in 2005 offset the cumulative effect of raw material inflation over the 2004 to 2005 period 

retail information services segment

  the impact of acquisitions net of product line divestitures was approximately 3 million in 2006 and 21 million in 2005 foreign currency translation contributed to the increase in sales by approximately 3 million in 2006 and 7 million in 2005 

operating income 

  operating income in 2006 and 2005 benefited from productivity improvement actions including the migration of production from hong kong to lower cost facilities in mainland china benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by increased spending for information systems stock option expense and other incremental employeerelated costs in 2006 and higher costs associated with growth initiatives in 2005 operating income in both years included charges for restructuring asset impairment and lease cancellation 

other specialty converting businesses

cash flow provided by operating activities 

   for cash flow purposes changes in assets and liabilities exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and certain noncash transactions discussed in “analysis of selected balance sheet accounts” below

proceeds from sale of businesses 

  in 2006 we sold a longterm investment and divested both a product line in europe and the raised reflective pavement marker business 

cash flow used in financing activities 

 30 borrowings and repayment of debt 

  at year end 2006 our borrowings outstanding under foreign shortterm lines of credit were 1015 million weightedaverage interest rate of 96 compared to 1083 million at year end 2005 weightedaverage interest rate of 66 

  shortterm variable rate commercial paper borrowings were 1544 million at december 30 2006 weightedaverage interest rate of 50 compared to 2553 million at december 31 2005 weightedaverage interest rate of 23 

  we had mediumterm notes of 160 million outstanding at year end 2006 and 2005 in 2005 mediumterm notes of 73 million were paid on maturity outstanding mediumterm notes have maturities from 2007 through 2025 and accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from 59 to 75 

  in august 2004 we issued 150 million in floating rate senior notes due in 2007 under our 2001 shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” these notes are callable at par 

shareholders’ equity 

  our shareholders’ equity was 168 billion at year end 2006 compared to 151 billion at year end 2005 our annual dividend per share increased to 157 in 2006 from 153 in 2005 

share repurchases 

  on october 26 2006 the board of directors authorized an additional 5 million shares of the company’s stock for our repurchase program resulting in a total authorization of approximately 74 million shares of the company’s stock at that date during the fourth quarter of 2006 we repurchased approximately 25 million shares as of december 30 2006 approximately 49 million shares were available for repurchase under the board of directors’ authorization 

  in the fourth quarter of 2005 we repurchased approximately 7 million shares under an agreement related to the le packaging “le” acquisition and recorded such amount to treasury stock see the other section of “contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements” below for further details 

analysis of selected balance sheet accounts 

longlived assets 

  goodwill increased 43 million during 2006 primarily due to foreign currency translation approximately 32 million and goodwill associated with an acquisition approximately 10 million 

  other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions decreased 3 million during 2006 due to amortization expense recorded during 2006 approximately 11 million partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation approximately 6 million and acquired intangibles associated with an acquisition approximately 2 million 

  other assets decreased approximately 64 million during 2006 due primarily to a decrease in assets related to pension and postretirement benefits approximately 68 million refer to note 6 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the change in accounting for pension and postretirement benefits as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 158 

other shareholders’ equity accounts 

  the value of our employee stock benefit trusts increased 51 million in 2006 due to an increase in the market value of shares held in the trusts approximately 122 million partially offset by the issuance of shares under our stock and incentive plans approximately 71 million 

31   accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately 39 million due to foreign currency translation partially offset by the aftertax impact of the adoption of sfas no 158 approximately 57 million refer to note 6 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” to the consolidated financial statements 

effect of foreign currency 

  international operations generate approximately 55 of our net sales our future results are subject to changes in political and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates to reduce our income statement exposure to transactions in foreign currencies we enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts where available and appropriate 

impact of foreign currency translation 

   while there was a benefit from foreign currency translation in 2006 this benefit was lower compared to prior years the benefit to sales in 2006 primarily reflected a benefit from currencies in canada brazil korea and china partially offset by a negative impact of the euro and currencies in south africa and australia the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income is smaller than the impact on net sales because our products are generally sourced in the currencies in which they are sold as a result the impact of foreign exchange rates on sales is matched with a partially offsetting impact on reported expenses thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income 

  our net income for 2005 and 2004 included translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies which included turkey for accounting purposes operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years operations in hyperinflationary economies consist of our operations in the dominican republic which use the us dollar as the functional currency these operations were not significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2006 turkey was removed from hyperinflationary status 

analysis of selected financial ratios 

  we utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance as discussed below 

working capital ratio 

  working capital current assets minus current liabilities excluding working capital of heldfor sale business as a percent of net sales decreased in 2006 primarily due to an increase in shortterm debt working capital from continuing operations as a percent of net sales is shown below we use this nongaap measure as a tool to assess our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing activities refer to “uses and limitations of nongaap measures” the timing of financing activities is not necessarily related to our current operations and would tend to distort the working capital ratio from period to period our objective is to minimize our investment in working capital from operations by reducing this ratio to maximize cash flow and return on investment 

32 working capital from continuing operations 

   as a percent of sales working capital from continuing operations in 2006 weakened compared to 2005 in 2006 the change primarily reflected a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and income taxes payable working capital changes included the impact of currency 

accounts receivable ratio 

  the average number of days sales outstanding was 58 days in 2006 and 2005 calculated using a fourquarter average accounts receivable balance divided by the average daily sales for the year 

inventory ratio 

  average inventory turnover was 85 in 2006 compared to 88 in 2005 calculated using the annual cost of sales divided by a fourquarter average inventory balance the decrease is due to higher average inventory levels primarily to support customer service initiatives 

debt ratios 

   the decrease in the total debt to total capital ratio in 2006 was due to a decrease in total debt outstanding and an increase in shareholders’ equity 

  our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of income we were in compliance with these covenants as shown in the table above 

  the fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities at year end the fair value of our total debt including shortterm borrowings was 963 million in 2006 and 11 billion in 2005 

shareholders’ equity ratios 

 33   increases in these ratios in 2006 compared to 2005 were primarily due to higher net income these ratios are computed using actual net income and a fivequarter average denominator for equity and total debt accounts 

capital resources 

  capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt financing we maintain adequate financing arrangements at competitive rates these financing arrangements consist of our commercial paper programs in the us and europe committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit in the countries where we operate callable commercial notes and longterm debt including mediumterm notes 

capital from debt 

  our total debt decreased approximately 120 million in 2006 to 968 million compared to year end 2005 reflecting payments of debt partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation 

  in july 2004 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with ten domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of 525 million expiring july 16 2009 we use the financing available under this agreement as a commercial paper backup facility and to finance other corporate requirements there was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of year end 2006 and 2005 

  in addition we have a 364day revolving credit facility with a foreign bank to provide up to euro 30 million 396 million in borrowings through july 31 2007 with the approval of the bank we may extend the revolving period and due date on an annual basis our intention is to negotiate an extension of this facility in 2007 financing under this agreement is used to finance cash requirements of our european operations as of year end 2006 263 million was outstanding under this agreement 

  we had standby letters of credit outstanding of 771 million and 812 million at the end of 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately 359 million at year end 2006 our uncommitted lines of credit do not have a commitment expiration date and may be cancelled by the banks or us at any time 

  in the fourth quarter of 2004 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to permit the issuance of up to 500 million in debt and equity securities proceeds from the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing existing debt and for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions as of december 30 2006 no securities had been issued under this registration statement 

  credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings when determining a credit rating the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position business outlook consistency of cash flows debt level and liquidity geographic dispersion and management team 

our credit ratings as of year end 2006 

 34 contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations at year end 2006 

  

   we enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and transportation the terms of our leases do not impose significant restrictions or unusual obligations except for the facility in mentor ohio as noted below the table above includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms of one year or more 

  on september 9 2005 we completed the lease financing for a commercial facility the “facility” located in mentor ohio used primarily for the new headquarters and research center for our roll materials division the facility consists generally of land buildings equipment and office furnishings we have leased the facility under an operating lease arrangement which contains a residual value guarantee of 334 million we do not expect the residual value of the facility to be less than the amount guaranteed 

  we did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year end 2006 in the table of contractual obligations above because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems 

investigations and legal proceedings 

  on october 19 2006 we were notified by the doj that the doj had decided to close its criminal investigation initiated in april 2003 into competitive practices in the label stock industry without further action 

  on november 15 2006 we announced that we had been notified by the ec that the ec had closed its investigation initiated in may 2004 into the company’s competitive activities in the label stock industry with no action 

  in july 2004 we were notified by the competition law division of the department of justice of canada that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation in august 2005 we were notified by the australian competition and consumer commission that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation we are cooperating with these investigations 

  we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation we are also a named defendant in a purported class action in the us seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices 

  we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could be adverse and material these matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements 

35 environmental 

  we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

  we have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

  during the third quarter of 2006 we recognized an additional liability of 13 million for estimated environmental remediation costs for a former operating facility for which 2 million had been accrued in the second quarter of 2006 the amount accrued represents the lower end of the current estimated range of 15 million to 17 million for costs expected to be incurred we considered additional information provided by outside consultants in revising our previous estimates of expected costs this estimate could change depending on various factors such as modification of currently planned remedial actions change in site conditions change in the estimated time to complete remediation change in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and other factors 

  other amounts currently accrued are not significant to our consolidated financial position and based upon current information we believe that it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

other 

  in 2005 we contacted relevant authorities in the us and reported the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of our reflectives business in china and involved among other things impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments the payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken sales of our reflectives business in china in 2005 were approximately 7 million based on findings to date no changes to our previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result of these matters however we expect that fines or other penalties may be incurred while we are unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties we believe that our behavior in detecting investigating responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably 

  we and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of our business based upon current information we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us 

  we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized these costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary 

36   we participate in receivable financing programs both domestically and internationally with several financial institutions whereby we may request advances from these financial institutions at december 30 2006 we guaranteed approximately 22 million of these advances 

  we also guaranteed up to approximately 22 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries’ obligations to their suppliers as of december 30 2006 

  in connection with the le acquisition in 2002 we issued approximately 7 million shares at 6308 per share we also entered into an agreement with le whereby in the event the value of our common shares fell below the price of the shares that were issued to le adjusted for dividends received during the period from january 1 2005 through december 31 2007 le had the option to exercise a trueup right upon exercise of this trueup right we had the option to 1 pay the difference in value to le in the form of a cash or b common shares or 2 repurchase the shares at the issued share price adjusted for dividends paid the trueup obligation was reduced by any shares sold by le to third parties during 2005 le sold 44603 shares to third parties on october 20 2005 le notified us that it was exercising its trueup right under the agreement for the remaining approximately 7 million shares we repurchased the remaining shares under the agreement for 41 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 

uses and limitations of nongaap measures 

  our presented nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of certain events activities or strategic decisions the accounting effects of these events activities or decisions which are included in the gaap measures may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the company in a single period by excluding certain accounting effects both positive and negative for example divestitures and acquisitions from certain of our gaap measures management believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the company’s “core” or “underlying” operating results these nongaap measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying business as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period 

  limitations associated with the use of our nongaap measures include 1 the exclusion of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from the calculation of organic sales growth 2 the exclusion of mandatory debt service requirements as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business such as discretionary debt reductions dividends share repurchase acquisitions etc for calculation of free cash flow and 3 the exclusion of shortterm debt from the calculation of working capital ratio from continuing operations while some of the items the company excludes from gaap measures recur these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts we believe that supplemental nongaap measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the company’s performance and operating trends 

related party transactions 

  from time to time we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties we believe that such transactions are at arm’s length and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 

  one of our directors peter w mullin is the chairman chief executive officer and a director of mc insurance services inc “mc” mullin insurance services inc “minc” and pwm insurance services inc “pwm” executive compensation and benefit consultants and insurance agents mr mullin is also the majority stockholder of mc minc and pwm collectively referred to as the “mullin companies” we paid premiums to insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the mullin companies in connection with several of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies have advised us that they earned commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and renewal of this insurance approximately 50 of these commissions were allocated to and used by mc insurance agency services llc and mullintbg insurance agency services affiliates of mc to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statements to participants under several of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies own a minority interest in m financial 

37 holdings inc “mfh” substantially all of the life insurance policies which we placed through the mullin companies in 2006 and prior years are issued by insurance carriers that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance carriers and m life insurance company “m life” a whollyowned subsidiary of mfh reinsurance returns earned by m life are determined annually by the insurance carriers and can be negative or positive depending upon the results of m life’s aggregate reinsurance pool which consists of the insured lives reinsured by m life the mullin companies have advised us that they participated in net reinsurance gains of m life none of these transactions were significant to our financial position or results of operations 

summary of related party activity 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense actual results could differ from those estimates 

  critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require us to make difficult subjective andor complex judgments critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown we believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition sales returns and allowances accounts receivable allowances inventory and inventory reserves longlived asset impairments pensions and postretirement benefits income taxes stockbased compensation restructuring and severance costs and litigation 

revenue recognition 

  sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists pricing is determinable and collection is reasonably assured furthermore sales provisions for estimated returns and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers and when the customers assume the risks and rewards of ownership sales terms are generally fob free on board shipping point or fob destination depending upon local business customs for most regions in which we operate fob shipping point terms are utilized and sales are recorded at the time of shipment because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred in certain regions notably in europe fob destination terms are generally utilized and sales are recorded when the products are delivered to the customer’s delivery site because this is when title and risk of loss are transferred actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances 

  sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate volume promotional price cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold these estimates 

38 are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products we review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available 

sales returns and allowances 

  sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our customers both affiliated and nonaffiliated for the return of unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of return we accrue for returns and allowances based upon the gross price of the products sold and historical experience for such products we record these allowances based on the following factors i customer specific allowances and ii an estimated amount based on our historical experience for issues not yet identified 

accounts receivable allowances 

  we are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy historical experience and future expectations the allowances for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value we record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount based on our historical experience for issues not yet identified no single customer represented 10 or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2006 and 2005 however our ten largest customers at year end 2006 represented approximately 18 of trade accounts receivable and consisted of six customers of our office and consumer products segment three customers of our pressuresensitive materials segment and one customer of both these segments the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 

inventory and inventory reserves 

  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials workinprogress or finished goods cost is determined using methods that approximate both the firstin firstout “fifo” and lastin firstout “lifo” methods inventories valued using the lifo method comprised 29 and 32 of inventories before lifo adjustment at year end 2006 and 2005 respectively the company’s international operations are on the fifo basis of inventory cost accounting us operations use both fifo and lifo our limited use of the lifo valuation methodology reflects the taxbasis election in place at the time of previous acquisitions of businesses in the us 

  inventory reserves are recorded for damaged obsolete excess and slowmoving inventory we use estimates to record these reserves slowmoving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 

longlived asset impairments 

  we record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of longlived assets are determined not to be recoverable impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value fair value is typically determined using quoted market prices if available or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition the amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our longlived assets 

39 pensions and postretirement benefits 

  in december 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” 

   assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries in the event we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return or health care costs future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost 

   we in consultation with our actuaries annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our postretirement obligations the assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available in the us our discount rate is determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds the projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans 

   we determine the longterm rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets taking into consideration that assets with higher volatility typically generate a greater return over the long run additionally current market conditions such as interest rates are evaluated and peer data is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness 

   our practice is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits on a cash basis for measurement purposes a 9 annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2007 this rate is expected to decrease to approximately 5 by 2011 

income taxes 

  deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of income such as forecasted earnings the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning 

40 in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets is charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if later it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized we would release the previously provided valuation allowance 

  we calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent years 

  the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we believe that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may impact our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis 

stockbased compensation 

  effective january 1 2006 we began recognizing expense for stockbased compensation to comply with the provisions of the reissued sfas no 123r using the modified prospective application transition method as permitted by this transition method results for the prior periods have not been restated in addition we continued to recognize compensation cost related to outstanding unvested awards as of december 31 2005 under the original provisions of sfas no 123 stockbased compensation expense for all awards granted after december 31 2005 was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 123r 

valuation of stock options 

  our stockbased compensation expense is the estimated fair value of options granted amortized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period the fair value of each of our stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model this model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options 

  expected dividend yield was based on the current annual dividend divided by the 12month average monthly stock price prior to grant 

  expected volatility for options granted during 2006 was based on both historical and implied volatility expected volatility for options granted prior to 2006 was based on historical volatility of our stock price 

  riskfree rate was based on the average of the weekly tbond rate over the expected option term 

  expected term was determined based on historical experience under our stock option plans 

  forfeiture rate assumption was determined based on historical data of our stock option forfeitures over the last twelve years 

  certain of the assumptions used above are based on management’s estimates as such if factors change and such factors require us to change our assumptions and estimates our stockbased compensation expense could be significantly different in the future 

  we have not capitalized costs associated with stockbased compensation 

accounting for income taxes for stockbased compensation 

  we elected to use the shortcut method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits related to employee stockbased compensation awards 

41 restructuring and severance costs 

  we account for restructuring costs including severance and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the guidance provided in sfas no 112 “accounting for postemployment benefits” and sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” in the us we have a severance pay plan “pay plan” which provides eligible employees with severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination due to qualifying cost reduction actions we calculate severance pay using the severance benefit formula under the pay plan accordingly we record provisions for such amounts and other related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set forth under sfas no 112 in the absence of a pay plan liability for severance and other employeerelated costs are recognized when the liability is incurred and follow the guidance of sfas no 146 

litigation and environmental 

  we are currently involved in various lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of our business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we accrue estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims the ultimate resolution of these claims could affect future results of operations should our exposure be materially different from our earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously accrued 

recent accounting requirements 

  during 2006 we adopted several accounting and financial disclosure requirements of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” emerging issues task force “eitf” and financial interpretations by the staff of the fasb the requirements with the most significant impact were the reissued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” refer to note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for more information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend risk management 

  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

  our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes 

  our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes as a result we enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets liabilities firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs when available and appropriate the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 

  our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve our objectives we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings in connection with the issuance of the 250 million 10year senior notes in 2003 we settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss of approximately 325 million the loss is currently being amortized to interest expense over 10 years which corresponds to the term of the related debt 

  additionally we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations these amounts are not material to our financial statements 

  in the normal course of operations we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions other risks associated with foreign operations commodity price risk and litigation risk which are not represented in the analyses that follow 

43 foreign exchange valueatrisk 

  we use a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions firm commitments accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were included in the model forecasted transactions which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model the var was estimated using a variancecovariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on twoyear historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks a 95 confidence level was used for a oneday time horizon 

  the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

  the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately 5 million at year end 2006 

interest rate sensitivity 

  an assumed 40 basis point move in interest rates 10 of our weightedaverage interest rate on floating rate debt affecting our variablerate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on our 2006 earnings

  our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials office products and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are “converted” into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting and some are sold in unconverted form as base materials tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of office products and other converted products and other items not involving pressuresensitive components such as binders organizing systems markers fasteners business forms as well as tickets tags and imprinting equipment for retail and apparel manufacturers 

  a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

  selfadhesive materials may initially cost more than materials using heat or moisture activated adhesives but the use of selfadhesive materials often provides cost savings because of their easy and instant application without the need for adhesive activation they also provide consistent and versatile adhesion with minimal adhesive deterioration and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape and color

  our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations including without limitation any relating to the us department of justice’s antitrust division “doj” criminal investigation as well as the european commission “ec” canadian department of justice and australian competition and consumer commission investigations into industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter thereof including purported class actions in the united states seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices and purported class actions related to alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation as well as a likely fine by the ec in respect of certain employee misconduct in europe see item 3 “legal proceedings” there can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable 

the demand for our products is impacted by economic conditions of the principal countries in which we operate a decline in the economies in these countries could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

  we have operations in over 40 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control including changes in the political social economic tax and 

5 regulatory environments including tariffs in the countries in which we operate as well as the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for our products in addition approximately 55 percent of our sales are in foreign currencies which fluctuate in relation to one another and to the united states dollar fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction translation and other losses to us which can negatively impact our sales and profitability 

we operate in some highly competitive markets if we do not compete effectively we could lose market share and experience falling prices adversely affecting our financial results 

  we are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key markets and implement new technologies making them more competitive there is also the possibility that competitors will be able to offer additional products services lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 

as a manufacturer our sales and profitability are also dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy which are subject to price fluctuations and the ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor 

  inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to recur and our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on to customers changes in costs in our selling prices for products and through improvements in productivity also it is important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of materials equipment and packaging from suppliers a disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our future results may be affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected 

  we are undergoing efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations including closure of facilities headcount reductions organizational simplification process standardization and using a variety of tools such as lean sigma and kaizen events to accomplish this productivity which is not assured lower levels of productivity could result in lower production sales and profitability cost reduction actions in turn could expose us to additional production risk 

slower growth in key markets could adversely affect our profitability 

  our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key end use markets or applications for our products our overall performance will be influenced by these markets 

our customers are widely diversified but in certain portions of our business industry concentration has increased the importance and decreased the number of significant customers 

  in particular sales of our office and consumer products in the united states are concentrated in a few major customers principally office product superstores mass market distributors and wholesalers the business risk associated with this concentration including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt writeoffs could negatively affect our margins and profits 

our ability to develop and successfully market new products and applications is important in maintaining growth 

  the timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success research and development for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends we could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers 

6 infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents could harm our ability to grow 

  because our products involve complex technology and chemistry we are sometimes involved in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property parties have filed and in the future may file claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be held to be liable to pay damages or obtain licenses there can be no assurance that licenses will be available and the cost to defend these infringement claims and to develop new technology could be significant 

  we also could have our intellectual property infringed we attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information but it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information and develop similar technologies in addition many of the countries in which we operate have limited or no protection for intellectual property rights the costs involved to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our profitability 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities 

  our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings in future periods 

  assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries who we rely on as experts in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return or health care costs our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire other companies these acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties including integration technology and personnel 

  in order to grow our product lines and to expand into new markets we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future many risks uncertainties and costs are associated with the acquisitions the integration of systems objectives personnel product lines markets customers suppliers and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results are uncertain there can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability 

in order for us to remain competitive it is important to recruit and retain highlyskilled employees 

  there is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees due to rapid expansion in certain markets and the ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions it may be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers of highlyskilled employees 

we need to comply with many environmental health and safety laws 

  due to the nature of our business we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes we have accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup sites including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued 

7 in order to mitigate risk it is important that we obtain various types of insurance 

  we have various types of insurance including health life and property since the 911 terrorist attacks insurance premiums have risen considerably and recent natural disasters will likely result in an additional increase in insurance premiums as the cost of insurance continues to increase our financial results could be adversely affected 

significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our operations sales customer relations and financial results 

  we rely on a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions like other information technology systems ours is susceptible to damage or interruptions caused by natural disasters power failures viruses and security breaches we upgrade and install new systems which if installed or programmed incorrectly could cause significant disruptions if a disruption occurs we could incur losses and costs for remediation and interruption of operations 

our share price has been volatile 

  our stock price is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general other factors including market expectations for our performance the level of perceived growth of our industries and announcements concerning industry investigations have also impacted our share price there can be no assurance that our stock will be less volatile in the future 

if our credit ratings are downgraded we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short and longterm financing from capital markets 

  credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings standard and poor’s “sp” has assigned us a credit rating of a2 for shortterm and a for longterm financing sp has given us a negative outlook moody’s investors service “moody’s” has assigned us a credit rating of p2 for shortterm and a3 for longterm financing moody’s has given us a stable outlook if our credit ratings were to be downgraded our financial flexibility would decrease and the cost to borrow would increase we have no assurance that the current credit ratings will be maintained 

our reputation sales and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations 

  there are occasions when we ship products with quality issues resulting from defective materials manufacturing packaging or design many of these issues are discovered before shipping but this causes delays in shipping delays in the manufacturing process and occasionally cancelled orders when the issues are discovered after shipment this causes additional shipping costs possible discounts possible refunds and potential loss of future sales both preshipping and postshipping quality issues can result in financial consequences along with a negative impact on our reputation 

some of our products are sold by third parties 

  our products are not only sold by us but by third party distributors and retailers as well some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of these third parties could affect our sales and profitability 

we outsource some of our manufacturing if there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers our business could be negatively impacted 

  we manufacture most of our products but occasionally thirdparty manufacturers are needed for specialty jobs or capacity overflow outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to control product failure late deliveries customer dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for labor standards because of possible quality problems and customer dissatisfaction outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

8   the risks described above are not exclusive additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be less significant may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the above risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to decline

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed the company is participating with other prps at all such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

  the company has accrued liabilities for all sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and based upon current information management believes it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  on april 14 2003 the company announced that it had been advised that the us department of justice was challenging the proposed merger of upmkymmene “upm” and the morgan adhesives “mactac” division of bemis co inc “bemis” on the basis of its belief that in certain aspects of the label stock industry “the competitors have sought to coordinate rather than compete” the company also announced that it had been notified that the us department of justice had initiated a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label stock industry

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tableend overview and outlook 

overview 

   our sales from continuing operations increased 3 in 2005 compared to 12 growth in 2004 reflecting the factors summarized in the following table 

  

   the decrease in core unit volume in 2005 reflects the following factors 

   in addition to the factors noted above for 2004 core unit volume also benefited in that year from additional sales in the retail information services segment as a result of customer preparation for increased exports from china following the elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas in january 2005 

  the improvement in pricing and product mix in 2005 was primarily due to the impact of selling price increases implemented to offset higher raw material costs 

   in 2005 we initiated companywide cost reduction efforts which are expected to improve our global operating efficiencies these actions include reductions in headcount which impact most businesses and geographic regions and expected divestitures of lowmargin businesses and product lines in connection with these actions we recorded cash and noncash charges related to severance and other employeerelated costs as well as asset impairments the charges are detailed in “cost reduction actions” below 

  as a result of our expected sale of a business in 2006 that manufactures raised reflective pavement markers and the divestiture of our package label converting business in europe in october 2003 discussed below in “acquisitions and divestitures” the discussions which follow generally reflect summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise noted however the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations 

   net income decreased 533 million or 19 in 2005 compared to 2004 

  negative factors affecting the change in net income included 

   positive factors affecting the change in net income included 

 summary results by segment 

  

 

   our pressuresensitive materials segment reported a 4 increase in sales in 2005 compared to 2004 approximately 60 of the incremental sales was due to the positive impact of changes in pricing and product mix reflecting increased selling prices implemented to offset higher raw material costs this benefit was partially offset by a decrease in core unit volume due in part to the impact of the extra week in 2004 a decline in core unit volume in north america which reflected market share loss related to price increases was partially offset by growth from international sales foreign currency translation also contributed to sales growth for this segment 

  operating income for this segment increased 38 million or 17 in 2005 reflecting cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives including the closure of two european plants during the first six months of 2004 operating income for this segment included charges related to restructuring costs and asset impairment in both 2005 and 2004 the impact of higher raw material costs was offset by selling price increases 

16 office and consumer products 21 of net sales 

  our office and consumer products segment reported a 3 decrease in sales in 2005 compared to 2004 the decrease in sales was primarily due to the impact of accelerated purchases in 2004 by customers in advance of our 2005 selling price increases and the impact of an extra week in 2004 the decrease in core unit volume was partially offset by a positive impact of changes in pricing and product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 

  operating income for this segment decreased 18 million or 10 reflecting lower sales volume and the writeoff of inventories and equipment primarily due to a product launch operating income for this segment included a charge related to restructuring costs and asset impairment charges in 2005 these decreases were partially offset by cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives the 2005 selling price increases offset the cumulative effect of raw material inflation since the beginning of 2004 

retail information services 12 of net sales 

  the retail information services segment reported a 6 increase in sales in 2005 compared to 2004 approximately 40 of the increase was due to core unit volume growth reflecting continued growth of the business in asia and latin america the benefit to core unit volume was partially offset by additional sales in 2004 as a result of customer preparation for increased exports from china following the elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas in january 2005 the balance of the growth reflected incremental sales from acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 

  operating income for this segment decreased 5 million or 11 due to charges for restructuring and asset impairments in 2005 and higher spending associated with growth initiatives partially offsetting these factors was the benefit of productivity improvement actions including the ongoing migration of production from hong kong to lower cost facilities in mainland china 

other specialty converting businesses 10 of net sales 

  other specialty converting businesses reported a 5 increase in sales in 2005 compared to 2004 due to core unit volume growth as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation operating income for these businesses decreased 26 million or 73 reflecting costs related to the development of the rfid business and charges related to restructuring costs and asset impairments in 2005 in 2005 due to the commercialization of our rfid business we have included rfid in this group of businesses financial results of this group have been restated for years presented herein to reflect this change 

sales growth by region 

  excluding the impact of acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency translation we estimate sales growth decline in major regions of operation as follows 

   in the us the decrease in 2005 was partially due to market share loss and a slow market in pressuresensitive materials as well as accelerated purchases in 2004 by office and consumer products customers in advance of our 2005 selling price increases these negative factors were partially offset by selling price increases weaker demand in the us also reflected a practice among end users of our products to move manufacturing outside the us this shift is offset by growth in emerging markets where manufacturing has moved 

17   in asia the pace of growth in 2005 moderated throughout the region including china the comparison to 2004 was also affected by additional sales in the retail information services segment in 2004 as a result of customer preparation for increased exports from china following the elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas in january 2005 

  in latin america the roll materials business was affected by market share loss as a result of selling price increases although there was a benefit from higher selling prices 

  in addition to the factors above the impact of the extra week in 2004 also affected comparisons of growth between 2005 and 2004 for all regions 

cost reduction actions and other expense 

   during the fourth quarter of 2005 we announced cost reduction actions related to restructuring and anticipated product line divestitures discussed in “acquisitions and divestitures” below we recorded charges related to severance and related costs and noncash charges for asset impairments included in the table above these actions impact most businesses and geographic regions and are expected to be completed by the end of 2006 the restructuring actions including anticipated charges in early 2006 are expected to result in annualized pretax savings of 80 million to 90 million when completed we expect to reinvest some of the savings into future growth opportunities in addition to the fourth quarter charges other charges were recorded earlier in 2005 including the closure of our gainesville georgia label converting plant which was completed during the third quarter of 2005 

  also included in “other expense” in 2005 was an accrual for legal expenses related to a patent lawsuit offset by gains on the sale of assets 

  the restructuring charges associated with severance and asset impairments recorded during 2004 were related to the completion of the integration of the 2002 acquisition of jackstädt into our other existing businesses we closed a manufacturing facility in france during the first quarter of 2004 and a manufacturing facility in italy during the second quarter of 2004 

  in 2003 the restructuring charges related to the integration of jackstädt and other productivity improvement initiatives 

  see also note 10 “components of other income and expense” to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

effective rate of taxes on income 

  the effective tax rate was 204 for the full year 2005 compared to 251 for the full year 2004 our 2005 tax rate included benefits from 

   these benefits were partially offset by incremental expense associated with the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 

18   the effective tax rate for 2004 included the benefits from changes in the geographic mix of income continued improvements in our global tax structure and several favorable global tax audit settlements 

free cash flow 

   free cash flow for 2005 decreased 63 million due primarily to lower net income the changes in assets and liabilities were partially offset by lower cash spending on capital in 2005 see “analysis of results of operations” and “liquidity” below for more information free cash flow refers to cash flow from operating activities less spending on property plant and equipment and software we use free cash flow as a measurement tool to assess the cash flow available for other corporate purposes such as dividends debt service and repurchase of common stock 

acquisitions and divestitures 

  in december 2005 we announced our plan to sell a business consisting of raised reflective pavement markers with sales of approximately 23 million in 2005 based on the estimated value of this business we concluded that associated goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition of this business were impaired resulting in a pretax charge of approximately 74 million the results of this business have been accounted for as discontinued operations for the years presented herein this business was previously included in the pressuresensitive materials segment 

  in december 2005 we also announced the expected divestiture of two lowmargin product lines one of these divestitures which impacts the office and consumer products segment was completed in february 2006 this product line had estimated sales of 60 million in 2005 and minimal impact on income the expected divestiture of the second product line would reduce annual sales by approximately 10 million with minimal impact to income from operations as part of these expected divestitures we recorded charges of approximately 6 million for severance and other employeerelated costs and asset impairments of approximately 9 million which are included in the “other expense” line of our consolidated statement of income 

  during the third quarter of 2004 we acquired rinke etiketten “rinke” a privately held company in germany the incremental impact of this acquisition on our net sales was approximately 9 million during 2004 with an additional impact of approximately 18 million in 2005 this business is reported in our retail information services segment 

  in october 2003 we completed the sale of our package label converting business in europe which consisted of two package label converting facilities in denmark and a package label converting facility in france which combined represented approximately 30 million in sales in the first nine months of 2003 the results from this business have been accounted for as discontinued operations for 2003

  in april 2003 we were notified by the us department of justice’s antitrust division “doj” that it had initiated a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label stock industry and on august 15 2003 the doj issued a subpoena to us in connection with the investigation in may 2004 the european commission “ec” initiated inspections and obtained documents from our pressuresensitive materials facilities in the netherlands and germany seeking evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities in july 2004 we were notified by the competition law division of the department of justice of canada that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation in august 2005 we were notified by the australian competition and consumer commission that it was seeking information in connection with a label 

19 stock investigation we are cooperating with these investigations we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation we are also a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices we have discovered instances of improper conduct by certain employees in our european operations that constituted an infringement of ec competition law accordingly we expect that the ec will impose a fine on us when its investigation is completed we have discovered instances of conduct by certain employees in china that potentially violate the us foreign corrupt practices act and we have reported that conduct to authorities in the us accordingly we expect that fines or other penalties may be incurred we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could well be adverse and material these matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements 

outlook 

  in 2006 we anticipate unit volume growth in the range of 2 to 3 this outlook is based on expected underlying growth of approximately 4 to 5 partially offset by the impact of product line divestitures and withdrawal from some lowmargin private label business we expect the positive impact from price and mix to be offset by a negative effect of foreign currency translation these expectations are subject to changes in economic and market conditions price increases in early 2006 are expected to offset raw material inflation incurred at the end of 2005 and early 2006 

  we expect our restructuring and business realignment efforts will reduce costs by 80 million to 90 million when completed we estimate that 60 to 70 of these savings will be achieved in 2006 however we expect to reinvest some of the savings into growth opportunities across the company in addition we anticipate transitional costs related to our productivity improvement actions to be approximately 15 million to 20 million which will be incurred in 2006 transitional costs include accelerated depreciation on assets expected to be retired by the end of 2006 costs of moving equipment and other related costs 

  to comply with the provisions of the reissued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” we will begin recognizing expense for stock options in 2006 we expect this pretax expense to be approximately 17 million in 2006 based on unvested stock options outstanding at year end 2005 which will have an estimated 12 per share impact on earnings after tax 

  we expect an increase in pretax expenses related to our pension plans of approximately 7 million due to changes in actuarial assumptions for our us and international plans 

  we expect continued improvement in marketing general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales additionally in 2006 we will be classifying shipping and handling costs as an element of cost of goods sold for all businesses to align our businesses around a standard methodology in 2005 several of our businesses included these costs in marketing general and administrative expenses totaling approximately 145 million refer to the shipping and handling costs section in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

  the pretax loss from our rfid business in 2006 is expected to be approximately 2 million to 7 million lower than in 2005 due to an increase in revenue and reduced spending 

  we estimate that pretax interest expense will be between 55 million to 60 million for 2006 assuming expected interest rate increases will be offset by expected reductions in debt 

  we anticipate an annual effective tax rate in the range of 20 to 23 for 2006 subject to changes in the geographic mix of income with potentially wide variances from quarter to quarter 

  we expect free cash flow after capital spending and purchases of software to be approximately 300 million to 350 million for 2006 

  we expect capital expenditures for 2006 to be approximately 175 million to 200 million funded through operating cash flow major projects in 2006 include new investments for expansion in china and 

20 india serving both our materials and retail information services businesses as well as spending for a new films coater in the us 

analysis of results of operations 

income from continuing operations before taxes 

  sales 

  sales increased 3 in 2005 compared to an increase of 12 in 2004 a decrease in core unit volume in 2005 partially reflected the loss of market share in our north american roll materials business following our implementation of selling price increases to offset higher raw material costs the 2005 volume decline also reflected the impact of an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year and accelerated purchases by office and consumer products customers in advance of our 2005 selling price increases both of which contributed to higher growth in 2004 combined the accelerated purchases and extra week in 2004 represented an estimated 60 million to 70 million of the change in sales between the two years 

  we realized selling price increases in 2005 of an estimated 100 million related to higher raw material costs however we experienced some related share loss in our north american roll materials business as previously described 

  in 2004 core unit volume also benefited from higher sales in the retail information services segment as a result of customer preparation for increased exports from china following the january 2005 elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas these benefits were partially offset by the impact of share loss with one major customer in the office and consumer products segment in late 2003 estimated to be 30 million 

  foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately 77 million in 2005 and approximately 207 million in 2004 

  incremental sales from acquisitions net of product line divestitures contributed approximately 19 million in 2005 in 2004 product line divestitures more than offset incremental sales from acquisitions the net impact reduced sales by approximately 33 million 

gross profit 

  gross profit margin in both 2005 and 2004 benefited from our ongoing productivity improvement initiatives including the completion of the integration of the jackstädt business in mid2004 and cost reduction actions in 2005 unfavorable segment mix faster growth in segments with lower gross profit margin as a percent of sales and raw material inflation partially offset these benefits in both years 

21   in 2005 gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by 

   in 2004 gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by declining selling prices during the first half of the year estimated to be 38 million 

marketing general and administrative expenses 

  marketing general and administrative expense as a percent of sales in 2005 and 2004 reflected the benefit of productivity improvement initiatives and cost reduction actions 

  offsetting the benefit of these productivity improvements marketing general and administrative expenses increased in 2005 due to 

   in 2004 marketing general and administrative expenses increased due to the same factors which impacted 2005 as well as higher insurance costs 

interest expense 

  interest expense decreased slightly in 2005 and was unchanged in 2004 the decrease in 2005 was due to a reduction in total debt outstanding partially offset by an increase in interest rates 

other expense restructuring and cost reduction actions 

  in 2005 other expense consisted of charges for cost reduction actions and restructuring associated with several expected product line divestitures as well as other items 

   in 2004 other expense consisted of charges for productivity improvement actions primarily related to the completion of the jackstädt integration actions 

   in 2003 other expense consisted of charges for restructuring related to the integration of jackstädt productivity improvement initiatives and net losses associated with several product line divestitures as well as other items

net income 

 taxes on income 

   our 2005 tax rate included the benefit of changes in the geographic mix of income and continued improvements in our global tax structure and a 9 million benefit from several favorable global tax audit settlements these benefits were partially offset by the incremental expense of 135 million associated with the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 

  our 2004 effective tax rate included the benefit from changes in the geographic mix of income continued improvements in our global tax structure and several favorable global tax audit settlements which reduced tax expense by approximately 8 million 

income loss from discontinued operations 

  income loss from discontinued operations includes our raised reflective pavement markers business in 2005 2004 and 2003 as well as our package label converting business in europe in 2003 

  based on the estimated value of the raised reflective pavement markers business that we are expecting to sell in 2006 we concluded that associated goodwill and intangible assets from our acquisition of this business were impaired the resulting pretax impairment charge was approximately 74 million in 2005 

  income from discontinued operations included net sales of approximately 23 million in 2005 and approximately 24 million in 2004 net income from discontinued operations in 2003 included a gain on sale of business of 197 million net of tax of 58 million income from all discontinued operations included net sales of approximately 70 million in 2003

 results of operations by segment 

pressuresensitive materials segment 

 net sales 

  sales in our pressuresensitive materials segment increased 4 in 2005 compared to 17 in 2004 a decline in core unit volume in 2005 reflected the loss of market share in north america following our implementation of selling price increases partially offset by growth internationally the benefit to core unit volume growth in 2004 resulting from an extra week in the fiscal year partially contributed to slower growth in 2005 sales growth in 2005 was also affected by slow market conditions in north america 

  sales growth in 2005 reflected the positive impact of pricing and product mix resulting from increased selling prices implemented to offset higher raw material costs 

  increased sales in our roll materials business approximately 112 million reflected increased selling prices partially offset by a decline in core unit volume our north american roll materials business experienced a decline in sales of approximately 3 due to share loss related to higher selling prices our roll materials business in europe experienced sales growth of approximately 7 in local currency resulting from volume growth in the region with stronger growth in the emerging markets of eastern europe market expansion contributed to sales growth for the roll materials business in asia although the pace of growth moderated in this region compared to the prior year in latin america loss of market share from selling price increases and loss of sales with a large customer affected growth partially offset by selling price increases sales for the graphics and reflective business were comparable to 2004 

  in 2004 increased sales in our roll materials business approximately 365 million reflected core unit volume growth including the extra week in the fiscal year in north america strong growth in new film products and selling price increases contributed to sales growth of approximately 9 in europe strong growth in the emerging markets of eastern europe and the benefit of selling price increases contributed to sales growth of approximately 9 in local currency strong market growth and share gain contributed to sales growth in local currency in asia and latin america 

  sales growth in 2004 in our graphics and reflective business approximately 63 million reflected market growth new applications and customers and geographic expansion 

  included in these increases was the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 58 million in 2005 and approximately 146 million in 2004 

   increased operating income in both years reflected higher sales and cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives including two plant closures related to the jackstädt integration in the first half of 2004 also reflected in operating income were charges related to restructuring asset impairments and lease cancellations in 2005 and 2004 

  in 2004 this segment experienced rising raw material costs throughout the year while selling price increases partially offset these increased costs the net impact reduced operating income for the year in contrast in 2005 the impact of higher raw material costs was offset through selling price increases 

office and consumer products segment 

 

   sales in our office and consumer products segment decreased 3 in 2005 while sales increased by less than 1 in 2004 in 2004 higher than usual volume in the fourth quarter was due in part to customers’ accelerated purchases in advance of selling price increases effective january 1 2005 as well as the benefit from an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year the shift in volume in late 2004 contributed to a decline in core unit volume in 2005 as customers depleted related inventories 

  in 2005 the positive impact of selling price increases partially offset the decrease in core unit volume selling prices were increased to offset higher raw material costs 

  in 2004 increased volume resulting from accelerated purchases and the extra week was offset by share loss with one major customer in late 2003 estimated 30 million impact in 2004 loss of sales from a discontinued product line approximately 14 million reduced prices and the continued erosion in market share of our averybrand products in favor of private label brands 

  foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately 8 million in 2005 and approximately 35 million in 2004 

   operating income reflected charges related to restructuring asset impairment and net losses associated with product line divestitures in 2005 and 2003 while 2004 operating income was negatively affected by lower selling prices and rising raw material costs the 2005 selling price increases offset the cumulative effect of raw material inflation over the twoyear period the changes in operating income reflected the benefit from continued cost reduction efforts as well as the writeoff of inventories approximately 9 million and equipment primarily related to a product launch 

25 retail information services segment 

 

   sales in our retail information services segment increased 6 in 2005 compared to 15 in 2004 the increase in both years was a result of core unit volume growth and incremental sales from acquisitions volume growth reflected continued growth of the business in asia and latin america and new product introductions sales in 2004 also reflected relatively weak results in 2003 related to slow industry conditions the impact of the extra week in the 2004 fiscal year and higher sales as a result of customer preparation for increased exports from china following the january 2005 elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas 

  the impact of acquisitions net of product line divestitures was approximately 21 million in 2005 in 2004 incremental sales from acquisitions were offset by the loss of sales from product line divestitures 

  foreign currency translation contributed to the increase in sales by approximately 7 million in 2005 and approximately 12 million in 2004 

   operating income reflected charges related to restructuring asset impairment and lease cancellation in 2005 and 2003 in 2005 operating income benefited from productivity improvement actions including the ongoing migration of production from hong kong to lower cost facilities in mainland china partially offset by higher costs associated with growth initiatives the increase in 2004 also reflected sales growth and the successful integration of the 2002 acquisitions 

other specialty converting businesses 

 

   sales in our other specialty converting businesses increased 5 in 2005 compared to 12 in 2004 the benefit to core unit volume growth in 2004 resulting from an extra week in the fiscal year partially contributed to slower growth in 2005 growth in 2004 was partially offset by the loss of sales from divested product lines approximately 15 million 

  foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in sales of approximately 4 million in 2005 and approximately 14 million in 2004 

   the decreases in operating income in both 2005 and 2004 primarily reflect incremental costs related to the development of the rfid business operating income also reflects charges related to restructuring and asset impairment in 2005 and 2003

   for cash flow purposes changes in assets and liabilities exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and certain noncash transactions discussed in the “analysis of selected balance sheet accounts” section below 

   cash flow provided by operating activities for 2005 was negatively impacted by changes in working capital as shown below

 cash flow used in investing activities 

 

   our major capital projects in 2005 included investments for growth in asia and latin america equipment and other investments for our rfid business and productivity and growth projects in our north american roll materials operations including development work related to the addition of capacity to meet growing demand for beverage labels 

   proceeds from sale of business were related to the sale of our package label converting business in europe during 2003 

cash flow used in financing activities 

 

   at year end 2005 our borrowings outstanding under foreign shortterm lines of credit were 1083 million with a weightedaverage interest rate of 66 compared to 708 million at year end 2004 

28   the 60 million oneyear callable commercial notes issued in january 2004 were paid at maturity in 2005 in june 2005 we issued 75 million of oneyear callable commercial notes at a variable rate of 35 and then called and paid the notes in november 2005 

  we had mediumterm notes of 160 million and 233 million outstanding at year end 2005 and 2004 respectively decreases are a result of payments on maturity mediumterm notes have maturities from 2007 through 2025 and accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from 59 to 75 

  in august 2004 we issued 150 million in floating rate senior notes due in 2007 under our 2001 shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” these notes are callable at par 

  in february 2004 we paid the obligation related to the 1999 transaction with steinbeis holding gmbh “steinbeis” for approximately 106 million this obligation was a result of the combination of our office products business in europe with zweckform büroprodukte gmbh 

shareholders’ equity 

  our shareholders’ equity was 151 billion at year end 2005 compared to 155 billion at year end 2004 our annual dividend per share increased to 153 in 2005 from 149 in 2004 

  in the fourth quarter of 2005 we repurchased 698505 shares for 41 million under an agreement related to the le packaging “le” acquisition and recorded such amount to treasury stock see the other section of “contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements” below for further details as of year end 2005 a cumulative 379 million shares of our common stock had been repurchased since 1991 and 25 million shares remain available for repurchase under the board of directors’ authorization 

analysis of selected balance sheet accounts 

longlived assets 

  goodwill decreased 38 million during 2005 due to foreign currency translation approximately 36 million purchase price allocation adjustments associated with the acquisition of rinke and the settlement of claims associated with the acquisition of rvl packaging inc partially offset by goodwill related to an acquisition in 2005 approximately 1 million 

  net other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions decreased 17 million during 2005 due to amortization expense recorded during 2005 approximately 12 million and the impact of foreign currency translation approximately 8 million partially offset by purchase price allocation adjustments associated with the acquisition of rinke approximately 3 million 

  other assets decreased approximately 78 million during 2005 due primarily to the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles in a business held for sale refer to the “discontinued operations” section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

other shareholders’ equity accounts 

  our employee stock benefit trusts decreased 67 million due to a decrease in the market value of shares held in the trust of 48 million during 2005 as well as issuance of shares under our stock and incentive plans for 2005 of approximately 19 million 

effect of foreign currency 

  international operations generate approximately 55 of our net sales our future results are subject to changes in political and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates to reduce our income statement exposure to transactions in foreign currencies we enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts where available and appropriate 

29 impact of foreign currency translation 

   while there was a benefit from foreign currency translation in 2005 this decreased significantly in 2005 compared to prior years due to strengthening of the us dollar the benefit in 2005 reflected the strength of the euro brazilian real canadian dollar and korean won against the us dollar the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income is smaller than the impact on net sales because our products are generally sourced in the currencies in which they are sold as a result the impact of foreign exchange rates on sales is matched with a partially offsetting impact on reported expenses thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income 

  translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies were included in our net income operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years operations in hyperinflationary economies consist of our operations in turkey and the dominican republic these operations were not significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

analysis of selected financial ratios 

  we utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance as discussed in detail below 

working capital ratio 

  working capital current assets minus current liabilities as a percent of net sales decreased in 2005 primarily due to an increase in shortterm debt working capital from continuing operations as a percent of net sales is shown below we use this nongaap measure as a tool to assess our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing activities the timing of financing activities is not necessarily related to our current operations and would tend to distort the working capital ratio from period to period our objective is to minimize our investment in working capital from operations by reducing this ratio to maximize cash flow and return on investment 

working capital from continuing operations 

   in 2005 the increase in working capital from continuing operations as a percent of sales was primarily due to changes in accounts payable income taxes payable cash and cash equivalents and refundable income taxes partially offset by the change in other accrued liabilities and trade accounts receivable these changes included the impact of currency 

30 accounts receivable ratio 

  the average number of days sales outstanding was 58 days in 2005 compared to 60 days in 2004 calculated using a fourquarter average accounts receivable balance this decrease reflects improved collections efforts across the businesses 

inventory ratio 

  average inventory turnover was 85 in both 2005 and 2004 calculated using a fourquarter average inventory balance for purposes of comparability the ratio was calculated using a 52week year for 2004 

debt ratios 

   the decrease in total debt to total capital was due to a decrease in total debt outstanding 

  our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of income we were in compliance with these covenants as shown in the table above 

  the fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities at year end 2005 and 2004 the fair value of our total debt including shortterm borrowings was 11 billion and 132 billion respectively 

shareholders’ equity ratios 

   decreases in these returns in 2005 compared to 2004 were primarily due to lower net income these ratios are computed using actual net income and a fivequarter average denominator for equity and total debt accounts 

capital resources 

  capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt financing we maintain adequate financing arrangements at competitive rates these financing arrangements consist of our commercial paper programs in the us and europe committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit in the countries where we operate callable commercial notes and longterm debt including mediumterm notes 

capital from debt 

  our total debt decreased approximately 124 million in 2005 to 109 billion compared to 121 billion at year end 2004 reflecting payments of debt and the effect of foreign currency translation 

31   in july 2004 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with ten domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of 525 million expiring july 16 2009 we use the financing available under this agreement as a commercial paper backup facility and to finance other corporate requirements there was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of year end 2005 

  in addition we have a 364day revolving credit facility with a foreign bank to provide up to euro 30 million 356 million in borrowings through july 19 2006 we may extend the revolving period and due date with the approval of the bank on an annual basis our intention is to renegotiate an extension of this facility in 2006 financing under this agreement is used to finance cash requirements of our european operations as of year end 2005 154 million was outstanding under this agreement 

  we had standby letters of credit outstanding of 812 million and 81 million at the end of 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately 409 million at year end 2005 our uncommitted lines of credit do not have a commitment expiration date and may be cancelled by the banks or us at any time 

  in the fourth quarter of 2004 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to permit the issuance of up to 500 million in debt and equity securities proceeds from the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing existing debt and for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions as of december 31 2005 no securities had been issued under the 2004 registration statement 

  credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing when determining a credit rating the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position business outlook consistency of cash flows debt level and liquidity geographic dispersion and management team 

  the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings 

our credit ratings as of year end 2005 

 contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations at year end 2005 

  

   we enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and transportation the terms of our leases do not impose significant restrictions or unusual obligations except for the facility in mentor ohio as noted below the table above includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms of one year or more 

32   we did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year end 2005 in the table of contractual obligations above because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems 

  in january 2006 we contributed 25 million to our domestic pension plan which is more than the amount required by us governmental agencies for 2006 

   in april 2003 we were notified by the doj that it had initiated a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label stock industry and on august 15 2003 the doj issued a subpoena to us in connection with the investigation in may 2004 the ec initiated inspections and obtained documents from our pressuresensitive materials facilities in the netherlands and germany seeking evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities in july 2004 we were notified by the competition law division of the department of justice of canada that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation in august 2005 we were notified by the australian competition and consumer commission that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation we are cooperating with these investigations we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation we are also a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices we have discovered instances of improper conduct by certain employees in our european operations that constituted an infringement of ec competition law we accordingly expect that the ec will impose a fine on us when its investigation is completed we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could well be adverse and material these matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements 

   we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

  we have accrued liabilities for such sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued amounts currently accrued are not significant to our consolidated financial position and based upon current information we believe that it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

   we have contacted relevant authorities in the us and reported the results of an internal investigation of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of our reflectives business in china and involved among other things impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments the payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken sales of our reflectives business in china in 2005 were approximately 7 million based on findings to date no changes to our previously filed financial statements are 

33 warranted as a result of these matters however we expect that fines or other penalties may be incurred while we are unable to predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties we believe that our behavior in detecting investigating responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed favorably 

  we and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of the business based upon current information we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us 

  we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized these costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold historical and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary 

  on september 9 2005 we completed the lease financing for a commercial facility to be located in mentor ohio this facility will be the new headquarters for our roll materials worldwide division and will consist generally of land buildings equipment and office furnishings and equipment the “facility” we will lease the facility under an operating lease arrangement which contains a residual value guarantee of 334 million we do not expect the residual value of the facility to be less than the amount guaranteed 

  we participate in receivable financing programs both domestically and internationally with several financial institutions whereby we may request advances from these financial institutions at december 31 2005 we guaranteed approximately 19 million of these advances 

  we guaranteed up to approximately 21 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries’ obligations to their suppliers as of december 31 2005

  from time to time we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties we believe that such transactions are at arm’slength and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties one of our directors peter w mullin is the chairman chief executive officer and a director of mc insurance services inc “mc” mullin insurance services inc “minc” and pwm insurance services inc “pwm” executive compensation and benefit consultants and insurance agents mr mullin is also the majority stockholder of mc minc and pwm collectively referred to as the “mullin companies” we paid premiums to insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the mullin companies in connection with several of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies have advised us that they earned commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and renewal of this insurance the majority of these commissions were allocated to and used by mc insurance agency services llc an affiliate of mc to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statements to participants under several of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies own a minority interest in m financial holdings inc “mfh” substantially all of the life insurance policies which we placed through the mullin companies in 

34 2005 and prior years are issued by insurance carriers that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance carriers and m life insurance company “m life” a whollyowned subsidiary of mfh reinsurance returns earned by m life are determined annually by the insurance carriers and can be negative or positive depending upon the results of m life’s aggregate reinsurance pool which consists of the insured lives reinsured by m life the mullin companies have advised us that they participated in net reinsurance gains of m life none of these transactions were significant to our financial position or results of operations 

summary of related party activity 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense actual results could differ from those estimates 

  critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require us to make difficult subjective andor complex judgments critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown we believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition sales returns and allowances accounts receivable allowances inventory reserves longlived asset impairments pensions and postretirement benefits income taxes restructuring and severance costs and litigation 

revenue recognition 

  sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists product delivery has occurred pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured sales provisions for estimated sales returns and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances 

  sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate volume promotional price cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products we review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available 

sales returns and allowances 

  sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our customers both affiliated and nonaffiliated for the return of unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of return we accrue for 

35 returns and allowances based upon the gross price of the products sold and historical experience for such products we record these allowances based on the following factors i customer specific allowances and ii an estimated amount based on our historical experience for issues not yet identified 

accounts receivable allowances 

  we are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy historical experience and future expectations the allowances for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value we record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount based on our historical experience for issues not yet identified no single customer represented 10 or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2005 and 2004 however our ten largest customers at year end 2005 represented approximately 20 of trade accounts receivable and consisted of six customers of our office and consumer products segment three customers of our pressuresensitive materials segment and one customer of both these segments the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 

inventory reserves 

  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials workin progress or finished goods inventory reserves are recorded for damaged obsolete excess and slowmoving inventory we use estimates to record these reserves slowmoving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 

longlived asset impairments 

  we record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of longlived assets are determined not to be recoverable impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value fair value is typically determined using quoted market prices if available or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition the amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our longlived assets 

pensions and postretirement benefits 

  assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts in the event we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return or health care costs future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related cost 

discount rate 

  we in consultation with our actuaries annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our postretirement obligations the assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available in the us our discount rate was determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds the projected pension benefit payment streams were then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflected the liability duration unique to our plans 

36 longterm return on assets 

  we determine the longterm rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets taking into consideration that assets with higher volatility typically generate a greater return over the long run additionally current market conditions such as interest rates are evaluated and peer data is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness 

healthcare cost trend rate 

  our practice is to fund the cost of the postretirement benefits on a cash basis for measurement purposes an 8 annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2006 this rate is expected to decrease to approximately 5 by 2009 

income taxes 

  deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of income such as forecasted earnings the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets is charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if later it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance 

  we calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following year adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent year 

  the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we believe that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may impact our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis 

restructuring and severance costs 

  we account for restructuring costs including severance and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the guidance provided in sfas no 112 “accounting for postemployment benefits” and sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” in the us we have a severance pay plan “pay plan” which provides eligible employees with severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination due to qualifying cost reduction actions we calculate severance pay using the severance benefits formula under the pay plan accordingly we record provisions for such amounts and other related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set forth under sfas no 112 in the absence of a pay plan liability for severance and other employeerelated costs are recognized when the liability is incurred and follow the guidance of sfas no 146 

litigation 

  we are currently involved in various lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of the business and in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we accrue estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims the ultimate resolution of these claims could affect our future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period should 

37 our exposure be materially different from our earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously accrued 

recent accounting requirements 

  during 2005 we adopted several accounting and financial disclosure requirements by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” emerging issues task force “eitf” and financial interpretations by the fasb none of which has had a significant impact on our financial results of operations and financial position refer to note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  in january 2006 we adopted the recognition provisions of sfas 123r “sharebased payment” following the guidance under modified prospective application and expect that the associated expense will be approximately 17 million in 2006 based on unvested stock options outstanding at year end 2005 such expense will have an estimated 12 per share impact on earnings after tax 

risk factors safe harbor statement 

  the matters discussed in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements which are not statements of historical fact may contain estimates assumptions projections andor expectations regarding future events which may or may not occur words such as “aim” “anticipate” “assume” “believe” “continue” “could” “estimate” “expect” “guidance” “intend” “may” “objective” “plan” “potential” “project” “seek” “shall” “should” “target” “will” “would” or variations thereof and other expressions which refer to future events and trends identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements and financial or other business targets are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results performance or achievements of the company expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements 

  certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in part 1 item 1a “risk factors” above and include but are not limited to risks and uncertainties relating to investment in development activities and new production facilities timely development and successful market acceptance of new products fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials ability of the company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions impact of competitive products and pricing business mix shift credit risks ability to obtain adequate financing arrangements fluctuations in pension insurance and employee benefit costs successful integration of acquisitions successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment customer and supplier concentrations financial condition and inventory strategies of customers changes in customer order patterns loss of significant contracts or customers legal proceedings including the doj criminal investigation as well as the european commission “ec” canadian department of justice and australian competition and consumer commission investigations into industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter thereof including purported class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices and purported class actions related to alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation as well as a likely fine by the ec in respect of certain employee misconduct in europe impact of potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act based on issues in china changes in governmental regulations fluctuations in interest rates fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations changes in economic or political conditions acts of war terrorism natural disasters impact of epidemiological events on the economy the company’s customers and suppliers and other factors

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend risk management 

  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

  our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes 

  our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes as a result we enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets liabilities firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs when available and appropriate the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 

  our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve our objectives we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings in connection with the issuance of the 250 million 10year senior notes in 2003 we settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss of approximately 325 million the loss is currently being amortized to interest expense over 10 years which corresponds to the term of the related debt 

  additionally we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations these amounts are not material to our financial statements 

  in the normal course of operations we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions other risks associated with foreign operations commodity price risk and litigation risk which are not represented in the analyses that follow 

39 foreign exchange valueatrisk 

  we use a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions firm commitments accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were included in the model forecasted transactions which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model the var was estimated using a variancecovariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on twoyear historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks a 95 confidence level was used for a oneday time horizon 

  the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

  the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately 45 million at year end 2005 

interest rate sensitivity 

  an assumed 28 basis point move in interest rates 10 of our weightedaverage interest rate on floating rate debt affecting our variablerate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on our 2005 earnings

our businesses include the production of pressuresensitive materials office products and a variety of tickets tags labels and other converted products some pressuresensitive materials are “converted” into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting and some are sold in unconverted form as base materials tapes and reflective sheeting we also manufacture and sell a variety of office products and other converted products and other items not involving pressuresensitive components such as binders organizing systems markers fasteners business forms reflective highway safety products as well as tickets tags and imprinting equipment for retail and apparel manufacturers 

  

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements a face material which may be paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

  

selfadhesive materials may initially cost more than materials using heat or moisture activated adhesives but the use of selfadhesive materials often provides cost savings because of their easy and instant application without the need for adhesive activation they also provide consistent and versatile adhesion with minimal adhesive deterioration and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape and color 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2004 we reorganized our reporting segments to reflect the growth in our retail information services business which now represents over 10 percent of our total sales refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” for further information this change has had no effect on the way we operate or manage our businesses

we produce a majority of our selfadhesive materials using waterbased emulsion and hotmelt adhesive technologies however a portion of our manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain organic solvents which unless controlled would be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments we invest in solvent capture and control units as well as solventfree systems to regulate emissions in connection with the acquisition of new manufacturing equipment and facilities 

  

we have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems emulsion adhesives hotmelt adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in our facilities in peachtree city georgia fort wayne and greenfield indiana and quakertown pennsylvania as well as in other plants in the united states argentina australia belgium brazil canada china colombia france germany india korea luxembourg malaysia mexico the netherlands south africa thailand and united kingdom 

  

based on current information we do not believe that the costs of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed the company is participating with other prps at all such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

  

the company has accrued liabilities for all sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and based upon current information management believes it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

on may 25 2004 officials from the european commission “ec” assisted by officials from national competition authorities launched unannounced inspections of and obtained documents from the company’s pressuresensitive materials facilities in the netherlands and germany the investigation apparently seeks evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities affecting the european paper and forestry products sector including the label stock market the company is cooperating with the investigation 

  

based on published press reports certain other european producers of paper and forestry products received similar visits from european authorities one such producer upm stated that it had decided to disclose to competition authorities “any conduct that has not comported with applicable competition laws” and that it had received conditional immunity in the european union and canada with respect to certain conduct it has previously disclosed to them contingent on full cooperation 

  

in the course of its internal examination of matters pertinent to the ec’s investigation of anticompetitive activities affecting the european paper and forest products sector the company discovered instances of improper conduct by certain employees in its european operations this conduct violated the company’s policies and in some cases constituted an infringement of ec competition law as a result the company expects that the ec will fine the company when its investigation is completed the ec has wide discretion in fixing the amount of a fine up to a maximum fine of 10 percent of a company’s annual revenue because the company is unable to estimate either the timing or the amount or range of any fine the company has made no provision for a fine in its financial statements however the company believes that the fine could well be material in amount there can be no assurance that additional adverse consequences to the company will not result from the conduct discovered by the company or other matters under ec or other laws the company is cooperating with authorities continuing its internal examination and taking remedial actions

the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of the business based upon current information management believes that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect the company

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tableend   

overview and outlook 

  

our sales from continuing operations increased 12 percent in 2004 to 534 billion compared to 2003 net income and diluted earnings per share increased 118 million and 10 per share respectively 

  

the increase in sales was due to growth in core unit volume and the benefit of foreign currency translation 

  

core unit volume grew an estimated 8 percent in 2004 core unit volume growth is a measure of sales performance that excludes the estimated impact of acquisitions divestitures changes in product mix and pricing and currency translation we use this measure to evaluate underlying demand for our products and services and to assess sales trends over time growth in core unit volume was due to generally improved economic conditions and growth in the emerging markets of asia latin america and eastern europe as well as the benefit from new products and applications due in part to our growth acceleration program “horizons” an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year and accelerated purchases by office and consumer products customers in advance of our 2005 selling price increases 

  

net income increased 4 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

positive factors included 

  

   

   

   

   

negative factors included 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result of the divestiture of our package label converting business in europe in october 2003 discussed below in “acquisitions and divestitures” the discussions which follow generally reflect summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise noted however the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2004 we reorganized our reporting segments to reflect the growth in our retail information services business which now represents over 10 percent of our total sales this reorganization is in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” and provides enhanced transparency of our operational results the new segments are based upon the types of products markets served by each segment methods of manufacturing and distribution and the economic characteristics of the businesses in each segment this change has had no effect on the way we operate or manage our businesses 

  

the newly reorganized segments are 

  

   

   

   

in addition to our reporting segments we have other specialty converting businesses comprised of several businesses that produce specialty tapes highly engineered labels and other converted products 

  

summary results by operating segment 

  

pressuresensitive materials 56 percent of net sales 

  

our pressuresensitive materials segment reported a 17 percent increase in sales in 2004 compared to 2003 approximately twothirds of the incremental sales was due to an increase in core unit volume primarily reflecting stronger sales in north america and the emerging markets of asia latin america and eastern europe volume growth in this segment was also due to market share gains and new applications including new film products as well as the benefit from an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year the remaining onethird of the sales increase was due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 

  

operating income operating income refers to income before interest and taxes for this segment increased 42 million or 24 percent compared to 2003 reflecting cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives including the closure of two european plants during the first six months of 2004 operating income was negatively impacted by rising raw material costs which were partially offset by selling price increases implemented during the second half of the year operating income for this segment included a pretax charge of approximately 34 million in 2004 compared to approximately 14 million in 2003 related to restructuring costs and asset impairment charges associated with the jackstädt integration 

  

office and consumer products 22 percent of net sales 

  

our office and consumer products segment reported a slight increase in sales in 2004 compared to 2003 sales in this segment were constrained by the previously announced share loss with one major customer and loss of sales from discontinued product lines declining prices in the first half of the year and the continued shift from branded to private label products these decreases were offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation accelerated purchases by customers in advance of our 2005 selling price increases and an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year 

  

operating income for the office and consumer products segment decreased 2 million or 1 percent due to lower selling prices and higher raw material costs partially offset by cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives 

  

retail information services 12 percent of net sales 

  

the retail information services segment reported a 15 percent increase in sales in 2004 compared to 2003 reflecting core unit volume growth in asia and geographic expansion in latin america as well as relatively weak results in 2003 related to slow industry conditions additionally higher sales in this segment reflected the benefit of new products and applications sales from small acquisitions made during the year and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 

  

operating income for this segment increased 24 million or 98 percent due to higher sales and cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives additionally operating income for this segment in 2003 included a pretax charge of approximately 7 million related to restructuring costs and asset impairment charges 

  

other specialty converting businesses 10 percent of net sales 

  

other specialty converting businesses reported a 12 percent increase in sales in 2004 compared to 2003 due to core unit volume growth as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by loss of sales from discontinued product lines operating income for these businesses increased 8 million or 18 percent due to higher sales 

  

sales growth by region 

  

excluding the impact of acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency translation we estimate sales growth in major regions of operation as follows 

  

   

impact of currency exchange rates 

  

international operations generate approximately 50 percent of our net sales before the elimination of sales between regions as a result we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our financial results foreign currency translation represented approximately 207 million of the change in sales between 2004 and 2003 approximately 08 of the change in our diluted earnings per share foreign currency translation represented approximately 235 million of the change in sales between 2003 and 2002 approximately 14 of the change in our diluted earnings per share the benefit from foreign currency translation reflected the strength of the euro british pound “gbp” australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar 

  

acquisitions and divestitures 

  

during the third quarter of 2004 we acquired rinke etiketten a privately held company in germany with annual sales of approximately 25 million in 2003 the impact of this acquisition on our net sales was approximately 9 million during 2004 this acquisition supports the growth in our retail information services segment 

  

in october 2003 we completed the sale of our package label converting business in europe which consisted of two package label converting facilities in denmark and a package label converting facility in france which combined represented approximately 30 million in sales in the first nine months of 2003 the results from this business have been accounted for as discontinued operations for 2003 and 2002 

  

cost reduction actions 

  

during the first six months of 2004 we completed the integration of the 2002 acquisition of jackstädt into our other existing businesses we closed a manufacturing facility in france during the first quarter and a manufacturing facility in italy during the second quarter and recorded restructuring charges associated with severance and asset impairments for each of these periods 

  

in the second quarter of 2004 we recorded pretax charges of 138 million for severance and asset impairment charges ninetyfive percent of these charges was associated with the completion of the jackstädt integration these charges were in addition to pretax charges in the first quarter of 2004 totaling 214 million also related to the jackstädt integration 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2003 we recorded pretax charges totaling 343 million associated with productivity improvement initiatives as well as the integration of the jackstädt acquisition described above the productivity improvement initiatives included headcount reductions of approximately 420 positions approximately half of which impacted the office and consumer products segment the remainder impacted the pressuresensitive materials and retail information services segments 

  

in connection with all of the integration and other cost reduction actions described above we realized an estimated 45 million of savings in 2004 annualized savings associated with these actions are anticipated to be approximately 50 million to 60 million 

  

during the first quarter of 2005 we announced the pending closure of our gainesville georgia label converting plant which is expected to provide an estimated 8 million of annualized savings as we move production to lower cost facilities over the next few quarters we will recognize restructuring charges and other transition costs associated with this action estimated to be between 9 million to 11 million the realization of savings from this action is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2005

operating expenses interest and taxes 

  

marketing general and administrative expenses increased 8 percent to 111 billion in 2004 compared to 103 billion in 2003 due to 

  

   

   

   

   

marketing general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales have improved to 208 percent in 2004 compared to 217 percent in 2003 due to 

  

   

   

   

interest expense was 585 million for 2004 which was unchanged from 2003 

  

the effective tax rate was 251 percent for the full year 2004 compared to 275 percent for the full year 2003 the decrease was due to changes in the geographic mix of income and the effect of favorable tax audit settlements the favorable tax audit settlements reduced tax expense by approximately 8 million during 2004 

  

free cash flow 

  

free cash flow for 2004 increased 2045 million to 338 million compared to 1335 million in 2003 due to higher net income and net changes in assets and liabilities as well as lower cash spending on capital in 2004 while total capital expenditures for 2004 totaled approximately 206 million the amount in the consolidated statement of cash flows was approximately 27 million lower due to the timing of actual cash payments see “liquidity” below for more information free cash flow refers to cash flow from operating activities less spending on property plant and equipment management utilizes free cash flow as a measurement tool to assess the cash flow available for other corporate purposes such as dividends and debt service 

  

   

industry investigations 

  

in april 2003 we were notified by the us department of justice’s antitrust division “doj” that it had initiated a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label stock industry and on august 15 2003 

  

the doj issued a subpoena to us in connection with the investigation in may 2004 the european commission “ec” initiated inspections and obtained documents from our pressuresensitive materials facilities in the netherlands and germany seeking evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities in july 2004 we were notified by the competition law division of the department of justice of canada that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation we are cooperating with these investigations we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation we are also a named defendant in purported stockholder class actions in the us seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices we have discovered instances of improper conduct by certain employees in our european operations that constituted an infringement of ec competition law accordingly we expect that the ec will impose a fine on us when its investigation is completed we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could well be adverse and material these matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements on page 63 in our 2004 annual report to shareholders 

  

outlook 

  

in 2005 we anticipate core unit volume growth in the range of 4 percent to 7 percent driven in part by strong growth in the emerging markets of asia latin america and eastern europe subject to changes in global economic and market conditions we expect a positive impact from price and mix as well as a benefit from foreign currency translation we anticipate that our selling price increases and ongoing productivity initiatives will offset rising raw material costs during the year 

  

we expect to continue improving profitability as a result of our pricing actions the successful consolidation of our roll materials business in europe during 2004 and anticipated cost savings from our ongoing productivity initiatives including six sigma 

  

offsetting these improvements to profitability during 2005 we expect to incur higher costs associated with our growth initiatives including rfid we expect increases in annual pension and medical costs to be in the range of 17 million to 18 million before taxes for 2005 due in part to an estimated increase of 13 million for pension expense the projected increase in pension expense reflects the adjustment of our actuarial assumptions for both the us and international plans for example our longterm rate of return on plan assets and discount rate were lowered by 25 basis points for the us pension plans to 875 percent and 60 percent respectively our estimate of pension expense will be impacted by changes in foreign currency translation 

  

we estimate that interest expense will be between 50 million to 60 million for 2005 assuming expected interest rate increases offset by projected reductions in debt 

  

we anticipate an annual tax rate in the range of 25 percent to 27 percent for 2005 with potentially wide variances from quarter to quarter on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 was adopted we are presently assessing various provisions of this act including the provision for a onetime repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings our current intention is to continue to reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely and therefore no related deferred tax liability has been recorded at this time 

  

to comply with the provisions of the reissued sfas no 123 “sharebased payment” we expect to begin recognizing expense for stock options beginning in the third quarter of 2005 we estimate that our aftertax stock option expense will be 8 million to 10 million for the second half of 2005 

  

analysis of results of operations 

  

   

2004 vs 2003 

  

sales increased 12 percent to 534 billion in 2004 compared to 476 billion in 2003 the increase in sales in 2004 was a result of 

  

   

   

   

core unit volume growth was attributable in part to growth in emerging markets the impact of the horizons growth program the impact of an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year and accelerated purchases by office and consumer products customers in advance of the 2005 selling price increases these increases were partially offset by the impact in 2004 of loss of sales from discontinued product lines approximately 45 million and share loss with one major customer in late 2003 estimated to be 30 million 

  

gross profit margins for 2004 and 2003 were 296 percent and 306 percent respectively the decrease in 2004 was due to

marketing general and administrative expense as a percent of sales was 208 percent in 2004 and 217 percent in 2003 the ratio in 2004 decreased due to higher sales the benefit from productivity improvement initiatives and segment mix faster growth in segments with lower operating expenses as a percent of sales expenses increased approximately 78 million due to

financial condition 

  

liquidity 

  

cash flow provided by operating activities 

  

   

for cash flow purposes changes in assets and liabilities exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures 

  

  

cash flow provided by operating activities was impacted by higher net income changes in working capital and tax timing differences cash flow provided by income taxes was a result of the timing of refunds received payments made the current year tax accrual and changes in deferred taxes cash flow provided by accounts payable and accrued liabilities is due to the timing of payments and increased activity to support higher sales in the pressuresensitive materials and retail information services segments cash flow used for longterm retirement benefits and other liabilities reflected contributions of approximately 36 million to our retirement plans during 2004 

  

  

cash flow provided by operating activities was impacted by changes in working capital and tax timing differences the cash flow used for taxes on income was primarily due to a 30 million payment for taxes in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of payment timing differences compared to the prior year cash flow used for accounts receivable was due to the timing of sales late in the fourth quarter of 2003 this was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of days sales outstanding from 61 in 2002 to 60 in 2003 cash flow used for inventory was due to continued growth in asia as well as intentional inventory build up in europe to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions associated with the jackstädt integration actions the cash flow provided by accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to increased inventory purchases as well as extended payment terms with suppliers partially offset by a reduction in payroll and benefits as a result of lower bonus and vacation accruals the cash flow used for longterm retirement benefits and other liabilities reflected a contribution of approximately 31 million to our retirement plans during 2003

net cash flow used in investing activities was 2169 million in 2004 1656 million in 2003 and 5753 million in 2002 

  

capital spending 

  

capital expenditures in 2004 were 2057 million compared to capital expenditures of 2014 million in 2003 due to the timing of payments the related cash used for capital expenditures was approximately 179 million in 2004 our major capital projects in 2004 included expansion of capacity in asia and latin america productivity improvement in our north american roll materials operations and equipment related to the development of our rfid business

in 2004 payments for acquisitions of 15 million were for several small private companies in the retail information services segment primarily for the acquisition of rinke etiketten based in germany 

  

in 2003 payments for acquisitions of 69 million were primarily due to the final settlement of certain contingencies related to the achievement of performance targets associated with the 2001 acquisition of dunsirn industries inc proceeds from sale of business of 588 million were related to the sale of our package label converting business in europe during 2003 

  

cash flow used in provided by financing activities 

  

net cash flow used in provided by financing activities was 2471 million in 2004 1667 million in 2003 and 687 million in 2002 

  

borrowings and repayment of debt 

  

in august 2004 we issued 150 million in floating rate senior notes due 2007 under our 2001 shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” these notes are callable at par after one year 

  

total commercial paper borrowings at year end 2004 were 2909 million with a weightedaverage interest rate of 221 percent compared to 2817 million at year end 2003 the outstanding borrowings at year end 2004 were classified as longterm because we have the ability and intent to refinance this debt under our available revolving credit agreement 

  

for 2004 our borrowings outstanding under foreign shortterm lines of credit were 708 million with a weightedaverage interest rate of 73 percent compared to 829 million outstanding at year end 2003 

  

in january 2004 we issued 60 million of oneyear callable commercial notes at a variable rate of 13 percent in april 2004 we issued 90 million of oneyear callable commercial notes at a rate of 13 percent which replaced the april 2003 oneyear callable commercial notes in august 2004 we called the 90 million notes issued in april 2004 the remaining 60 million was outstanding at year end with an interest rate of 25 percent in february 2005 these notes were repaid 

  

we had mediumterm notes of 233 million and 318 million at year end 2004 and 2003 respectively mediumterm notes have maturities from 2005 through 2025 and accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from 59 percent to 73 percent 

  

in february 2004 we paid the obligation related to the 1999 transaction with steinbeis holding gmbh “steinbeis” for approximately 106 million this obligation was a result of the combination of our office products business in europe with zweckform büroprodukte gmbh see note 4 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements on page 57 of our 2004 annual report to shareholders 

  

shareholders’ equity 

  

our shareholders’ equity increased to 155 billion at year end 2004 from 132 billion at year end 2003 we paid a total of 1646 million in dividends in 2004 compared to 1602 million in 2003 our annual dividend per share increased to 149 in 2004 from 145 in 2003 additionally net proceeds from the exercise of stock options were approximately 19 million in 2004 compared to approximately 6 million in 2003 

  

effect of foreign currency translation 

  

international operations generate approximately 50 percent of our net sales before the elimination of sales between regions our future results are subject to changes in political and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates foreign currency translation represented approximately 207 million of the change in sales between 2004 and 2003 approximately 08 of the change in our diluted earnings per share foreign currency translation represented approximately 235 million of the change in sales between 2003 and 2002 approximately 14 of the change in our diluted earnings per share the benefit from foreign currency translation reflected the strength of the euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income is smaller than the impact on net sales because our products are generally sourced in the currencies in which they are sold as a result the impact of foreign exchange rates on sales is matched with a partially offsetting impact on reported expenses thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income to reduce our exposure to those expenses in foreign currencies that do not match the related sales we enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts where available and appropriate 

  

all translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies were included in our net income operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years operations in hyperinflationary economies consist of our operations in turkey for 2004 2003 and 2002 and the dominican republic in 2004 these operations were not significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

analysis of selected balance sheet accounts 

  

longlived assets 

  

goodwill increased 40 million during 2004 due to foreign currency translation approximately 33 million and additional goodwill associated with the acquisitions of rinke etiketten and other small private companies approximately 13 million partially offset by tax assessments related to the rvl acquisition reduction of approximately 5 million 

  

other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions net of accumulated amortization decreased 6 million during 2004 due to amortization expense recorded during 2004 approximately 14 million this decrease was partially offset by foreign currency translation approximately 6 million and other acquisitions during 2004 approximately 2 million 

  

other assets increased approximately 63 million during 2004 due to increases in deferred tax assets approximately 29 million cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance contracts approximately 17 million and pension assets approximately 14 million 

  

other current liabilities 

  

other current liabilities accrued payroll and employee benefits trade rebates and other decreased approximately 83 million during 2004 reflecting the payment of the steinbeis obligation 1015 million at yearend 2003 and net payments related to severance from the 2004 and 2003 cost reduction actions approximately 13 million these decreases were partially offset by additional accrued trade rebates approximately 24 million 

  

other shareholders’ equity accounts 

  

the market value of shares held in the employee stock benefit trusts increased by 58 million during 2004 due to changes in stock price partially offset by the issuance of shares from the trusts shares issued under our stock and incentive plans for 2004 were valued at approximately 34 million 

  

as of year end 2004 a cumulative 372 million shares of our common stock had been repurchased since 1991 and 32 million shares remain available for repurchase under the board of directors’ authorization 

  

analysis of selected financial ratios 

  

we utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial condition and operating performance as discussed in detail below 

  

working capital ratio 

  

working capital current assets minus current liabilities as a percent of net sales was 29 percent for 2004 compared to 12 percent for 2003 due to a decrease in shortterm debt and the current portion of longterm debt and payment of the steinbeis obligation working capital from continuing operations as a percent of net sales which is a nongaap measure was 67 percent for 2004 compared to 71 percent for 2003 as shown below we utilize the working capital from continuing operations ratio as a measurement tool to assess our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our financing activities the timing of financing activities is not necessarily related to our current operations and would tend to distort the working capital ratio from period to period our objective is to minimize our investment in working capital from operations by reducing this ratio to maximize cash flow and return on investment 

  

working capital from continuing operations consists of 

  

   

the improvement in working capital from continuing operations in 2004 as a percent of sales was due to higher balances in accounts payable approximately 71 million and other current liabilities approximately 16 million these increases were partially offset by higher balances in cash and cash equivalents approximately 55 million and accounts receivable approximately 54 million included in the changes in working capital balances from the prior year was the impact of changes in foreign currency translation higher balances in 

  

accounts payable were due to increased capital and inventory purchases late in 2004 the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to the timing of cash receipts late in the fourth quarter of 2004 higher accounts receivable balances at the end of 2004 reflected an increase in sales partially offset by the timing of cash receipts late in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  

accounts receivable ratio 

  

the average number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 60 days for both 2004 and 2003 calculated using a fourquarter average accounts receivable balance 

  

inventory ratio 

  

inventory turnover increased from 84 in 2003 to 85 in 2004 calculated using a fourquarter average inventory balance in 2004 cost of products sold used in the ratio was calculated using a 52week year for comparability 

  

debt ratios 

  

our total debt to total capital was 439 percent at year end 2004 compared to 472 percent at year end 2003 this decrease was due to higher equity balances at the end of 2004 

  

the fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities at year end 2004 and 2003 the fair value of our total debt including shortterm borrowings was 124 billion and 121 billion respectively 

  

our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of income in 2004 our ratios were within required ranges specifically under the loan agreements the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before other expense see note 10 “components of other income and expense” to the consolidated financial statements on page 66 of our 2004 annual report to shareholders interest taxes depreciation and amortization may not exceed 35 to 10 our ratio at year end 2004 was 18 to 10 our consolidated earnings before other expense interest and taxes as a ratio to consolidated interest may not be less than 35 to 10 our ratio at year end 2004 was 80 to 10 

  

shareholders’ equity ratios 

  

our return on average shareholders’ equity was 199 percent in 2004 223 percent in 2003 and 257 percent in 2002 return on average total capital was 134 percent in 2004 143 percent in 2003 and 158 percent in 2002 these ratios are computed using actual net income and a fivequarter average denominator for balance sheet accounts decreases in these returns in 2004 compared to 2003 were primarily due to higher equity and longterm debt balances 

  

capital resources 

  

our sources of capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt financing we maintain adequate financing arrangements at competitive rates these financing arrangements consist of our commercial paper programs in the us and europe committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit in the countries where we operate callable commercial notes and longterm debt including mediumterm notes 

  

capital from debt 

  

our total debt increased approximately 31 million in 2004 to 121 billion compared to 118 billion at year end 2003 reflecting the effect of foreign currency translation 

  

our committed credit availability at year end 2004 was as follows 

  

   

in july 2004 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with 10 domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of 525 million expiring july 16 2009 this revolving credit agreement replaces our previous agreements for a 250 million credit facility that would have expired july 1 2006 and a 200 million 364day credit facility that would have expired december 3 2004 both of which were terminated in connection with our new revolving credit agreement we use the financing available under the new agreement as a commercial paper backup facility and to finance other corporate requirements the terms of the new agreement are generally similar to the previous agreements there was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of year end 2004 

  

in addition we have a 364day revolving credit facility with one foreign bank to provide up to euro 30 million 406 million in borrowings through may 25 2005 we may annually extend the revolving period and due date with the approval of the bank it is the intention of management to renegotiate an extension of this agreement during 2005 financing under this agreement is used to finance cash requirements in europe there was no debt outstanding under this agreement as of year end 2004 

  

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of 81 million and 1955 million at the end of 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately 360 million at year end 2004 our uncommitted lines of credit do not have a commitment expiration date and may be cancelled by the banks or us at any time 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2004 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to permit the issuance of up to 500 million in debt and equity securities proceeds from the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing existing debt and for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions this registration statement replaced the 2001 shelf registration which had a remaining 50 million of issuance capacity no securities were issued at yearend 2004 under the new registration statement 

  

credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing when determining a credit rating the rating agencies place significant weight on our competitive position business outlook consistency of cash flows debt level and liquidity geographic dispersion and management team 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings our credit ratings as of year end 2004 are as follows 

  

   

capital from equity 

  

we had 1241 million in common stock with 1 par value 7661 million in capital in excess of par and 1001 million shares outstanding at the end of 2004 additionally we had total retained earnings of 189 billion which included 2797 million of net income less dividends paid of 1646 million in 2004 

  

our accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased 749 million in 2004 primarily due to a 879 million benefit from foreign currency translation during the year partially offset by an additional minimum pension liability of 149 million net of tax for both our us and international pension plans the increase in minimum pension liability was a result of changes in assumptions and changes in plan assets and liabilities at the end of 2004 

  

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

at year end 2004 our contractual obligations included 

  

    

we enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and transportation the terms of our leases do not impose significant restrictions or unusual obligations minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year are included in the above table 

  

we did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year end 2004 in the table of contractual obligations above because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems 

  

we have been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has been agreed upon we are participating with other prps at all such sites and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

  

we have accrued liabilities for all such sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued amounts currently accrued are not significant to our consolidated financial position and based upon current information we believe that it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized these costs primarily include materials and labor associated with the service or sale of products factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units installed or sold historical 

  

and anticipated rate of warranty claims on those units cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation and availability of insurance coverage as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary 

  

in april 2003 we were notified by the doj that it had initiated a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label stock industry and on august 15 2003 the doj issued a subpoena to us in connection with the investigation in may 2004 the ec initiated inspections and obtained documents from our pressuresensitive materials facilities in the netherlands and germany seeking evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities in july 2004 we were notified by the competition law division of the department of justice of canada that it was seeking information in connection with a label stock investigation we are cooperating with these investigations we are a named defendant in purported class actions in the us seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation we are also a named defendant in purported stockholder class actions in the us seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices we have discovered instances of improper conduct by certain employees in our european operations that constituted an infringement of ec competition law we accordingly expect that the ec will impose a fine on us when its investigation is completed we are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect could well be adverse and material these matters are reported in note 8 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements on page 63 in our annual report to shareholders 

  

we and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of the business based upon current information we believe that the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect us 

  

we participate in receivable financing programs both domestically and internationally with several financial institutions whereby we may request advances from these financial institutions at january 1 2005 we guaranteed approximately 18 million of these advances 

  

in february 2003 we entered into a fiveyear operating lease on equipment that contains a residual value guarantee of 106 million we do not expect the residual value of the equipment to vary significantly from the amount guaranteed 

  

we guaranteed up to approximately 20 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries’ obligations to their suppliers as of january 1 2005 

  

in connection with the le acquisition we issued 743108 shares at 6308 per share in the event the value of our common shares falls below the price of the shares that were issued to le adjusted for dividends received during the period from january 1 2005 through december 31 2007 we may be obligated to pay the difference in value in the form of cash or common shares to le at our option 

  

2005 capital spending plan 

  

we expect capital expenditures for 2005 to be approximately 200 million funded through operating cash flows major projects in 2005 include investments for growth in asia and latin america equipment and other investments for the rfid business and both productivity and growth projects related to our north american roll materials operations 

  

related party transactions 

  

from time to time we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties we believe that such transactions are at arm’slength and for terms that would have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties one of our directors peter w mullin is the chairman chief executive officer and a director of mc insurance services inc “mc” mullin insurance services inc “minc” and pwm insurance services inc “pwm” executive compensation and benefit consultants and insurance agents mr mullin is also the majority stockholder of mc minc and pwm collectively referred to as the “mullin companies” during 2004 2003 

  

and 2002 we paid premiums to insurance companies for life insurance placed by the mullin companies in connection with several of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies have advised us that mc minc and pwm earned commissions from such insurance companies in aggregate amounts of approximately 11 million 11 million and 13 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively for the placement and renewal of this insurance mr mullin had direct and indirect interests related to these commissions of approximately 8 million 7 million and 9 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the majority of these commissions were allocated to and used by mcp insurance services llc an affiliate of mc to administer benefit plans and provide benefit statements to participants under several of our employee benefit plans the mullin companies own a minority interest in m financial holdings inc “mfh” substantially all of the life insurance policies which we placed through the mullin companies in 2004 and prior years are issued by insurance companies that participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these insurance companies and a whollyowned subsidiary of mfh reinsurance returns earned by mfh can be negative or positive depending upon the results of mfh’s aggregate reinsurance pool which is determined annually by mfh the mullin companies have advised us that in 2004 they participated in reinsurance gains of mfh of which approximately 2 million of net gains were ascribed by mfh to our life insurance policies referred to above and in which gains mr mullin had direct and indirect interests of approximately 2 million none of these transactions were significant to our financial position or results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require us to make difficult subjective andor complex judgments critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown we believe that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances and customer complaint reserves inventory reserves longlived asset impairments pensions and postretirement benefits and income taxes 

  

revenue recognition 

  

sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists product delivery has occurred pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured sales provisions for estimated sales returns and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances 

  

sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which we operate volume promotional price cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales rebates and discounts are recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products we review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available 

  

accounts receivable allowances and customer complaint reserves 

  

we are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on established aging policy historical experience and future expectations the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value we record these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances 

  

ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount based on our historical experience for issues not yet identified no single customer represented 10 percent or more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2004 and 2003 however approximately 15 percent of our trade receivables at year end 2004 and 2003 were from eight customers of our office and consumer products segment the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

inventory reserves 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials workinprogress or finished goods inventory reserves are recorded for damaged obsolete excess and slowmoving inventory we use estimates to record these reserves slowmoving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 

  

longlived asset impairments 

  

we record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of longlived assets are determined not to be recoverable impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value fair value is typically determined using an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our longlived assets 

  

pensions and postretirement benefits 

  

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return or health care costs future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

  

income taxes 

  

deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of income such as forecasted earnings the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets is charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if later it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance 

  

we calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following year adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent year 

  

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we believe that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters however our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved which may impact our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis 

  

recent accounting requirements 

  

during 2004 we adopted several accounting and financial disclosure requirements by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” emerging issues task force “eitf” and financial interpretations by the fasb none of which has had a significant impact on our financial results of operations and financial position refer to note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements on page 48 of our 2004 annual report to shareholders for more information 

  

risk factors safe harbor statement 

  

except for historical information contained herein the matters discussed in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements which are not statements of historical fact may contain estimates assumptions projections andor expectations regarding future events which may or may not occur words such as “anticipate” “assume” “believe” “could” “estimate” “expect” “may” “plan” “project” “will” and other expressions which refer to future events and trends identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements and financial or other business targets are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results or performance of the company expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements 

  

certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in exhibit 991 hereto which is incorporated by reference and include but are not limited to risks and uncertainties relating to investment in development activities and new production facilities timely development and successful market acceptance of new products fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials impact of competitive products and pricing business mix shift credit risks ability to obtain adequate financing arrangements fluctuations in pension insurance and employee benefit costs successful integration of acquisitions projections related to estimated cost savings from productivity improvement actions successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment customer and supplier concentrations financial condition and inventory strategies of customers changes in customer order patterns increased competition loss of significant contracts or customers legal proceedings including the doj criminal investigation as well as the ec and canadian department of justice investigations into industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter thereof including purported class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices and purported class actions related to alleged disclosure violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the doj investigation as well as a likely fine by the ec in respect of certain employee misconduct in europe changes in governmental regulations fluctuations in interest rates fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations changes in economic or political conditions acts of war terrorism natural disasters impact of epidemiological events on the economy the company’s customers and suppliers and other factors 

  

the company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial expectations in the nearterm include 1 potential adverse developments in legal proceedings andor investigations regarding competitive activities 2 the degree to which higher raw material costs can be passed on to customers through selling price increases without a significant loss of volume 3 the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for the company’s products particularly in the us and western europe and 4 availability and cost of certain components used to manufacture adhesives used in some products sold by the company an extended shortage of which could disrupt production resulting in a potentially significant loss of revenue and earnings 

  

the company’s forwardlooking statements represent judgment only on the dates such statements were made by making any forwardlooking statements the company assumes no duty to update them to reflect new changed or unanticipated events or circumstances other than as may be required by law

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

risk management 

  

we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

  

our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes 

  

our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes as a result we enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets liabilities firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs when available and appropriate the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 

  

our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve our objectives we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings in connection with the issuance of the 250 million 10year senior notes in 2003 we settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss of approximately 325 million the loss is currently being amortized to interest expense over 10 years which corresponds to the term of the related debt 

  

additionally we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations these amounts are not material to our financial statements 

  

in the normal course of operations we also face other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions other risks associated with foreign operations commodity price risk and litigation risks which are not represented in the analyses that follow 

  

foreign exchange valueatrisk 

  

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions firm commitments accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were included in the model forecasted transactions which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model the var was estimated using a variancecovariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on twoyear historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks a 95 percent confidence level was used for a oneday time horizon 

  

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by us nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately 2 million at year end 2004 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

an assumed 19 basis point move in interest rates 10 percent of our weightedaverage interest rate on floating rate debt affecting our variablerate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on our 2004 earnings

 item 1   business tableend   

avery dennison corporation “registrant” or “avery dennison” was incorporated in 1977 in the state of delaware as avery international corporation the successor corporation to a california corporation of the same name which was incorporated in 1946 in 1990 registrant merged one of its subsidiaries into dennison manufacturing company “dennison” as a result of which dennison became a wholly owned subsidiary of registrant and in connection with which registrant’s name was changed to avery dennison corporation 

  

the business of avery dennison and its subsidiaries avery dennison and its subsidiaries are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “company” includes the production of pressuresensitive adhesives and materials and the production of consumer and converted products some pressuresensitive adhesives and materials are “converted” into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting and some are sold in unconverted form as base materials tapes and reflective sheeting the company also manufactures and sells a variety of consumer and converted products and other items not involving pressuresensitive components such as notebooks threering binders organizing systems markers fasteners business forms reflective highway safety products as well as tickets tags labels and imprinting equipment for retail and apparel manufacturers 

  

a pressuresensitive or self adhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by presson contact it generally consists of four elements face material which may include paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

  

selfadhesive materials may initially cost more than materials using heat or moisture activated adhesives but the use of selfadhesive materials often provides cost savings because of their easy and instant application without the need for adhesive activation they also provide consistent and versatile adhesion minimum adhesive deterioration and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape or color 

  

international operations constitute a significant portion of the company’s business and represent approximately 50 percent of the company’s sales in addition the company continues to expand its operations in asia latin america and eastern europe as of december 27 2003 the company manufactured and sold its products from approximately 275 sales offices and distribution and manufacturing facilities located in 44 countries and employed approximately 20300 persons worldwide

 item 2   properties tableend   

at december 27 2003 the company operated approximately 34 principal manufacturing facilities in excess of 100000 square feet and totaling approximately 5 million square feet the following sets forth the locations of such principal facilities and the operating segments for which they are presently used 

  

pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment 

  

   

   

consumer and converted products segment 

  

   

   

in addition to the company’s principal manufacturing facilities described above the company’s other principal facilities include its corporate headquarters facility and research center in pasadena california and offices located in brea california leiden the netherlands concord ohio framingham massachusetts wuppertal germany and zug switzerland

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend   

the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at eleven waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed upon the company is participating with other prps at all such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

  

the company has accrued liabilities for all sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and based upon current information management believes that it is unlikely that final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

on april 14 2003 the company announced that it had been advised that the us department of justice was challenging the proposed merger of upmkymmene “upm” and the mactac division of bemis co inc “bemis” on the basis of its belief that in certain aspects of the label stock industry “the competitors have sought to coordinate rather than compete” the company also announced that it had been notified that the us department of justice had initiated a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label stock industry 

  

on april 15 2003 the us department of justice filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois seeking to enjoin the proposed merger “doj merger complaint” the complaint which set forth the us department of justice’s theory of its case included references not only to the parties to the merger but also to an unnamed “leading producer” of north american label stock which is the company the complaint asserted that “upm and the leading producer have already attempted to limit competition between themselves as reflected in written and oral communications to each other through high level executives regarding explicit anticompetitive understandings although the extent to which these efforts have succeeded is not entirely clear to the united states at the present time” 

  

in connection with the us department of justice’s investigation into the proposed merger the company produced documents and provided testimony by messrs neal scarborough and simcic ceo president and group vice president—roll materials worldwide respectively

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition tableend   

overview and outlook 

  

the company’s sales from continuing operations in 2003 increased 15 percent compared to 2002 to 476 billion primarily due to incremental sales from acquisitions completed in 2002 and the benefit of foreign currency translation net income and diluted earnings per share increased by 4 percent and 3 percent respectively including the impact of charges taken in both 2003 and 2002 related to restructuring asset impairments lease cancellation costs and net losses associated with several product line divestitures see productivity improvement programs below as well as a gain on the sale of the company’s european package label converting business in 2003 the slower rate of growth in earnings compared to sales was due to a decline in the company’s gross profit margin see “analysis of results of operations” below 

  

the year 2003 was characterized by weak industrial and consumer demand in many of the company’s businesses core unit volumes grew an estimated 4 percent in 2003 compared to an estimated 7 percent to 8 percent in 2002 core unit volume growth is a measure of sales performance that excludes the estimated impact of acquisitions divestitures changes in product mix and pricing and currency translation management uses this measure to evaluate underlying demand for the company’s products and services and to assess sales trends over time the year 2003 was particularly challenging for the company’s office products business where sales declined during the year due to weak enduser demand in the fourth quarter the office products business began to reflect the impact of an estimated 35 million loss in annualized sales related to one major customer in addition weak underlying demand in the company’s north american and western european markets created a difficult pricing environment for several of the company’s businesses in europe for example the roll materials business was unable to secure adequate price increases to offset the negative margin impact of the british pound “gbp” weakening relative to the euro 

  

in the fourth quarter the company experienced an acceleration of the rate of growth in ongoing unit volumes compared to the rate of growth experienced in the preceding three quarters which resulted in better than expected net sales and net income for the quarter this acceleration in growth was experienced in most of the company’s businesses and geographic regions in which it competes the company believes that this improvement in underlying demand reflected the generally improving economic and market conditions affecting the company’s businesses as well as the success of the company’s growth initiatives discussed below 

  

acquisitions and divestitures 

during 2003 the company continued to integrate the operations of the 2002 acquisitions of jackstädt gmbh “jackstädt” rvl packaging inc “rvl” and le packaging “le” into the company’s existing businesses the jackstädt integration actions included facility closures and headcount reductions as well as the addition of new manufacturing capacity in the roll materials business in europe to support the consolidation of the company’s operations in that region the company expects to complete these integration actions in 2004 

  

in october 2003 the company completed the sale of its package label converting business in europe which consisted of two package label converting facilities in denmark and a package label converting facility in france which combined represented approximately 50 million in sales in 2002 in the fourth quarter the company recognized a 197 million aftertax gain related to this sale the results from this business which was previously reported in the company’s consumer and converted products segment have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

in general the discussions which follow reflect summary results from the company’s continuing operations unless otherwise noted however the net income and net income per share discussions include the impact of discontinued operations 

  

summary results by operating segment 

the pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment reported a 17 percent increase in sales in 2003 compared to 2002 an estimated 30 to 35 percent of the incremental sales for 2003 were a result of the acquisition of jackstädt in may 2002 approximately 45 percent of the incremental sales in 2003 were due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation the remaining 20 to 25 percent of the incremental sales were attributable to growth in the roll materials business primarily due to stronger sales in asia latin america and eastern europe as well as increased sales in other businesses operating income operating income refers to income before interest and taxes for this segment increased approximately 12 million or 6 percent compared to 2002 operating income reflected a charge of approximately 13 million in 2003 compared to approximately 22 million in 2002 related to restructuring asset impairments lease cancellation costs and net losses associated with several product line divestitures operating income for this segment also reflected higher sales partially offset by a more competitive pricing environment startup costs for new manufacturing equipment in europe and the incremental costs associated with growth initiatives in 2003 

  

the consumer and converted products segment reported a 10 percent increase in sales in 2003 compared to 2002 an estimated 65 percent of the incremental sales for 2003 resulted from the acquisitions of rvl and le in november 2002 partially offset by a reduction in sales from divested lines of business during the first quarter of 2003 and in late 2002 the balance of the incremental sales reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency translation operating income for this segment decreased approximately 10 million or 4 percent compared to 2002 the operating income reflected a charge of approximately 22 million in 2003 compared to approximately 10 million in 2002 related to restructuring asset impairments lease cancellation costs and net losses associated with several product line divestitures operating income for this segment also reflected higher sales offset by the impact of a more competitive pricing environment and negative product mix in the office products business as well as higher manufacturing costs related to a reduction in the average order size in the retail information services business unanticipated incremental costs related to backtoschool orders for office products during the third quarter and the incremental costs associated with growth initiatives in 2003 

  

sales growth by region 

sales increased an estimated 1 percent in the us an estimated 15 percent in asia an estimated 15 percent in latin america and an estimated 4 percent in europe excluding the impact of acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency translation 

  

impact of currency exchange rates 

international operations constitute approximately 50 percent of the company’s net sales as a result the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes to foreign currency exchange rates will impact the company’s financial results as previously noted in 2003 the company benefited from foreign currency translation particularly from the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar representing approximately 235 million of growth in net sales compared to 2002 the benefit of currency translation added approximately 014 to diluted earnings per share in 2003 which was partially offset by the reduction in operating margin associated with the weakening of the gbp relative to the euro specifically operating margin for products sold in the uk declined since selling prices were gbpdenominated while raw materials were eurodenominated 

  

growth initiatives 

in 2003 the company implemented a growth acceleration program “horizons” which is designed to strengthen sales by developing new products applications and services by the end of 2003 the horizons program had generated estimated incremental sales of 50 million on an annualized basis the company expects continued success from this initiative in 2004 and beyond 

  

during 2003 the company invested in other ongoing growth initiatives in particular the company continued to expand its presence in the emerging markets of asia latin america and eastern europe these markets represented approximately 15 percent of the company’s total sales in 2003 excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and acquisitions productbased longterm growth initiatives include among others a new line of photo identification badges that provide organizations with an easytouse system to log in and track visitors heatactivated permanent care labels for the apparel market and radiofrequency identification “rfid” labels and label material 

  

productivity improvement programs 

the company remains focused on its cost management efforts in 2002 the company recorded charges totaling 321 million for cost reduction programs and the reorganization of manufacturing and administrative facilities of the company the charges included employee severance and related costs for approximately 300 employees worldwide as well as charges related to the disposition of fixed assets 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2003 the company announced cost reduction actions associated with productivity improvement initiatives as well as its ongoing integration of the jackstädt acquisition the company recorded charges related to these actions totaling 343 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 for severance impairment and planned disposition of property plant and equipment lease cancellation costs and net losses associated with several product line divestitures see “analysis of results of operations” discussed below the productivity improvement initiatives included headcount reductions of approximately 420 positions with approximately half from the office products business these headcount reductions are anticipated to yield annualized savings of approximately 25 million to 30 million when completed by the end of 2004 in addition the jackstädt integration actions included headcount reductions of 110 positions 

  

the completion of the jackstädt integration in 2004 includes a further headcount reduction of approximately 500 positions final restructuring charges associated with these actions in the range of 30 million to 35 million are expected to be recognized during the first half of 2004 these actions are anticipated to result in annualized savings of approximately 25 million to 30 million which the company expects to begin realizing in the second half of 2004 

  

in addition to these cost reduction actions the company expects continued profitability improvement from its ongoing six sigma efforts a program designed to improve productivity and quality and other productivity initiatives 

  

operating expenses interest and taxes 

marketing general and administrative expenses increased 14 percent to 103 billion in 2003 compared to 9052 million in 2002 reflecting the impact of the 2002 acquisitions foreign currency translation and incremental costs associated with growth initiatives 

  

in addition insurance and employee benefit costs including pension expense discussed below increased by approximately 15 million in 2003 compared to 2002 while legal costs associated with the us department of justice’s investigation of the label stock industry and related matters were approximately 4 million in 2003 

  

weakness in the equity markets during 2002 and the lower interest rate environment resulted in adjustments to the 2003 pension assumptions as a result of these changes pension expense for 2003 increased approximately 11 million compared to 2002 

  

interest expense was 577 million for 2003 compared to 44 million for 2002 interest expense increased due to higher debt levels resulting from the acquisitions in 2002 as well as higher interest rates following the company’s refinancing of 400 million of variable rate shortterm borrowings through the issuance of longterm senior notes in january 2003 

  

the effective tax rate was 275 percent for 2003 compared to 295 percent in 2002 due to the benefit of structural and operational changes and the geographic mix of income 

  

free cash flow 

free cash flow for 2003 decreased 227 million to 134 million in 2003 compared to 361 million in 2002 due to net changes in assets and liabilities as well as higher capital expenditures in 2003 see “liquidity” below for more details free cash flow refers to cash flow from operating activities less spending on property plant and equipment 

  

   

us department of justice investigation 

in april 2003 the company was notified by the us department of justice’s antitrust division that it had initiated a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label stock industry and on august 15 2003 the us department of justice issued a subpoena to the company in connection with the investigation the company is cooperating in the investigation the company is a named defendant in purported class actions seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices which were filed after the announcement of the investigation the company is also a named defendant in purported stockholder class actions seeking damages and other relief for alleged disclosure violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices the company is unable to predict the effect of these matters at this time although the effect may be adverse and material these matters are reported in note 9 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements and item 3 legal proceedings herein 

  

outlook 

the company anticipates improvement in global economic and market conditions in 2004 and increases in sales and net income as a result of its growth and productivity improvement initiatives the company also expects to benefit from foreign currency translation in 2004 based on its expectation that the euro to us dollar exchange rate will remain above the average rate in 2003 the company believes that the benefit from foreign currency translation may be partially offset if it is unable to successfully increase prices to recover operating margin loss due to the weaker gbp relative to the euro 

  

the company expects higher earnings in the second half of 2004 than in the first half due to the timing of the savings associated with its cost reduction programs 

  

offsetting these positive expectations the company anticipates that revenue growth will be constrained by a continued decline in sales in the office products business primarily due to the market share loss previously described as well as other factors impacting enduser demand annual pension medical and insurance costs are expected to increase by approximately 13 million to 14 million before taxes due in part to an estimated increase of 9 million for pension expense resulting from the reduction in the weightedaverage discount rate assumption see note 12 “pensions and other postretirement benefits” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension plan assumptions however this increase could vary based upon the impact of foreign currency movements on expense the company also anticipates increased spending related to certain longterm growth initiatives 

  

the company estimates that interest expense in 2004 will be comparable to 2003 anticipated increases in interest rates are expected to be offset by debt reductions in the second half of the year 

  

the company anticipates that the effective tax rate will remain stable during 2004 at approximately 275 percent subject to changes in the geographic mix of income 

  

analysis of results of operations 

  

   

2003 vs 2002 

  

sales increased 15 percent to 476 billion in 2003 compared to 416 billion in 2002 the increase in sales in 2003 reflected incremental sales from the acquisitions of jackstädt in may 2002 and rvl and le in november 2002 estimated to be 310 million favorable impact of foreign currency translation approximately 235 million and growth in the existing businesses approximately 106 million the impact of incremental sales in 2003 from the 2002 acquisitions can only be estimated due to the fact that the jackstädt rvl and le acquisitions have been integrated with the company’s existing businesses these increases were partially offset by a reduction in sales from divested lines of business 2002 sales of approximately 45 million 

  

gross profit margins for the years ended 2003 and 2002 were 306 percent and 321 percent respectively the company’s gross profit margins for individual products within business units can vary significantly the decrease in 2003 was partially due to changes in business and product mix within the company’s operations sales in the lower gross profit margin businesses and product lines grew more rapidly than the higher gross profit margin businesses and product lines the decrease also reflected a more competitive pricing environment including the impact of the gbp weakening relative to the euro approximately 10 million startup costs for new manufacturing equipment in europe approximately 9 million higher manufacturing costs associated with a reduction in average order size in the retail information services business approximately 4 million and unanticipated incremental costs related to backtoschool orders for office products during the third quarter approximately 3 million 

  

marketing general and administrative expense as a percent of sales was 217 percent in 2003 and 218 percent in 2002 the ratio in 2003 decreased partially due to increased sales although the absolute amount of expenses increased the increase in expenses reflected incremental expenses resulting from the acquisitions during 2002 as well as higher pension insurance and employee benefit costs legal costs associated with the us department of justice investigation of the label stock industry and incremental costs associated with growth initiatives during the year additionally expenses were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates

income before taxes as a percent of sales was 7 percent in 2003 and 85 percent in 2002 the percentage decrease in 2003 reflected lower gross profit as a percent of sales and higher interest expense which was partially offset by lower marketing general and administrative expense as a percent of sales 

  

the effective tax rate was 275 percent in 2003 and 295 percent in 2002 the decrease in effective tax rate in 2003 was due to the benefit of structural and operational changes and the geographic mix of income

gross profit margins for the years ended 2002 and 2001 were 321 percent and 326 percent respectively the decrease in 2002 was due to the lower gross profit margin on the jackstädt business partially offset by reduced expenses as a result of cost reduction programs and other productivity initiatives 

  

marketing general and administrative expense as a percent of sales was 218 percent in 2002 and 219 percent in 2001 

  

the company also recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 relating to cost reduction actions the 2002 charge involved cost reduction programs and the reorganization of manufacturing and administrative facilities in both of the company’s operating segments the cost reduction efforts resulted in a pretax charge of 107 million which consisted of employee severance and related costs for approximately 300 positions worldwide also in the fourth quarter of 2002 the company recorded a 62 million pretax charge for the disposition of fixed assets comprised of machinery and equipment related to a reduction of costs in the reflective business as well as the jackstädt integration

interest expense for the years ended 2002 and 2001 was 44 million and 507 million respectively the decrease in 2002 was due to lower interest rates on shortterm floating rate debt partially offset by the additional interest on the debt used to fund the jackstädt acquisition in the second quarter of 2002 as well as the rvl and le acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002 

  

income before taxes as a percent of sales was 85 percent in 2002 and 93 percent in 2001 the percentage decrease in 2002 reflected the total third and fourth quarter pretax charges of 321 million related to cost reduction actions and lower gross profit margin as a percent of sales the decrease was partially offset by lower interest expense the elimination of goodwill amortization and lower marketing general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales 

  

the effective tax rate was 295 percent in 2002 and 324 percent in 2001 the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2002 was principally due to structural and other operational changes the impact of acquisitions the geographic mix of income and the change in accounting for goodwill

working capital ratio 

working capital current assets minus current liabilities as a percent of net sales increased to 12 percent for 2003 from 21 percent for 2002 management utilizes the working capital from continuing operations ratio as a measurement tool to assess the working capital requirements of the company because it eliminates the impact of fluctuations due to financing activities of the company the timing of financing activities is not necessarily related to current operations and would tend to distort the working capital ratio from period to period working capital from continuing operations as a percent of net sales as shown below increased to 71 percent for 2003 from 53 percent for 2002 management’s objective is to minimize its investment in working capital from operations by reducing this ratio to maximize cash flow and return on investment 

  

working capital from continuing operations consists of 

  

   

the increase in working capital from continuing operations in 2003 as a percent of sales was due to higher balances in accounts receivable approximately 110 million and inventory approximately 64 million and a lower balance in hedge liabilities a decrease of 37 million partially offset by increased balances in accounts payable approximately 110 million included in the changes in working capital balances from the prior year was the impact of changes in foreign currency translation higher accounts receivable balances at the end of 2003 reflected an increase in sales late in the fourth quarter given the timing of these sales management believes that

accounts receivable ratios

debt ratios

the company has accrued liabilities for all sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and based upon current information management believes that it is unlikely that the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates

critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and which require management to make difficult subjective andor complex judgments critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution 

  

of such matters is unknown the company believes that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances and customer complaint reserves inventory reserves longlived asset impairments and pensions and postretirement benefits 

  

revenue recognition 

  

sales provisions for estimated sales returns and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

marketsensitive instruments and risk management 

  

risk management 

  

the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes 

  

the company’s policy is not to hold or purchase foreign currency or interest rate contracts for trading purposes 

  

the company’s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk on earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes as a result the company enters into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of its existing foreign currency assets liabilities firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company’s consolidated net income 

  

the company’s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve its objectives the company may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowings in connection with the issuance of the 250 million 10year senior notes the company settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss of approximately 325 million the loss is currently being amortized to interest expense over 10 years which corresponds to the term of the related debt the company entered into the interest rate swap in may 2002 to secure the interest rate on the company’s anticipated longterm debt issuance the principal amount hedged was 250 million because of a shift in interest rates an unrealized loss of approximately 374 million was included in other comprehensive loss at the end of 2002 

  

in the normal course of operations the company also faces other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions other risks associated with foreign operations commodity price risk and litigation risks which are not represented in the analyses that follow 

  

foreign exchange valueatrisk 

  

the company uses a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings associated with both its foreign exchange positions and contracts this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions firm commitments receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were included in the model forecasted transactions which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model the var was estimated using a variancecovariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on twoyear historical data obtained from one of the company’s domestic banks a 95 percent confidence level was used for a oneday time horizon 

  

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by the company nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings for the company’s foreign exchange positions and contracts was 32 million at year end 2003 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

an assumed 20 basis point move in interest rates 10 percent of the company’s weightedaverage floating rate interest rate affecting the company’s variablerate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on the company’s 2003 earnings

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

the company’s disclosure controls system is based upon a global chain of financial and general business reporting lines that converge in the company’s headquarters in pasadena california as required by sec rule 13a15b the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and the company’s chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report 

  

based on the foregoing the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure 

  

there has been no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

  legal proceedings 

tableend   

the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency “epa” andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party “prp” at eight waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed upon the company is participating with other prps at all such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

  

the company has accrued liabilities for all sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the minimum cost or amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and based upon current information management believes that it is unlikely that final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the consolidated financial position and operations of the company 

  

the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of the business in the opinion of the company’s management the resolution of these matters will not materially affect the company

overview and outlook 

  

the company’s results for 2002 reflect growth from the completion of three acquisitions as well as sales from new products and applications in a variety of consumer and industrial markets improved profitability was achieved from cost reduction and productivity improvement programs such as six sigma a program designed to improve productivity and quality 

  

the pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment reported increased sales for 2002 compared to 2001 the worldwide roll materials business the graphics and reflective business outside the us and the domestic and international specialty tapes business reported sales growth the graphics and reflective business in the us however continued to be negatively impacted by generally weak economic conditions contributing to the growth in the segment was the acquisition in may 2002 of jackstädt gmbh “jackstädt” a manufacturer of pressuresensitive materials based in germany this acquisition was the company’s largest in over a decade jackstädt strengthens the company’s business in many developing markets and other growth areas around the world including asia latin america and eastern europe integration of the jackstädt business is progressing and the majority of the integration actions including cost and headcount reductions are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter 2004 

  

the consumer and converted products segment reported increased sales for 2002 compared to 2001 retail information services reported increased sales in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily as a result of the fourth quarter acquisitions of rvl packaging inc “rvl” a provider of brand identification products to apparel manufacturers and retailers and le packaging “le” one of rvl’s suppliers as well as from worldwide ticketing industrial and automotive products also reported increased sales in 2002 compared to 2001 although the office products business in north america posted modest sales growth in 2002 the european office products business reported a slight downturn in sales relative to the prior year the office products environment has been challenging over the past two years with superstores closing stores and reducing inventory while white collar layoffs have reduced enduser demand 

  

the company recorded charges totaling 321 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 for severance 107 million the impairment of property plant and equipment 175 million and lease cancellation costs 39 million approximately 40 percent of the 107 million severance charge was related to the elimination of avery dennison positions as a result of the jackstädt integration while the remainder was associated with the announcement of the closure of an office products’ manufacturing facility and other cost reduction actions approximately 50 percent of the 214 million charge for asset impairments and lease cancellation costs related to the integration of jackstädt the remainder of the charge primarily related to the reflective business the company expects additional headcount reductions of approximately 700 positions during 2003 and 2004 the company expects to take charges totaling approximately 20 million in the first quarter of 2004 for the balance of severance costs related to the jackstädt acquisition 

  

interest expense was 437 million for 2002 compared to 502 million in 2001 reflecting lower interest rates on the company’s shortterm floating rate debt the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap in may 2002 to secure the interest rate on the company’s anticipated longterm debt issuance to finance the acquisition of jackstädt the principal amount hedged was 250 million because of a shift in interest rates an unrealized loss of approximately 374 million related to the swap was included in other comprehensive loss at the end of 2002 in january 2003 the company issued 250 million of 10year and 150 million of 30year notes for the purpose of refinancing the shortterm obligations on a longterm basis in connection with the issuance of the notes the company settled the interest rate swap at a loss of approximately 325 million the loss will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt interest expense will increase as a result of the refinancing 

  

  

subsequent to the announcement of the rvl and le acquisitions standard  poor’s rating services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” reviewed the company’s debt ratings sp reaffirmed the company’s “a1” shortterm rating “a” longterm rating and “negative” outlook moody’s downgraded the company’s shortterm rating from “p1” to “p2” and its longterm rating from “a2” to “a3” and changed the outlook for the company from “negative” to “stable” the downgrade will increase interest rates on the company’s debt beginning in 2003 based on current interest rates and the current level of debt the increased interest cost associated with the downgrade is estimated to have an aftertax impact in the range of approximately 1 million to 3 million per year 

  

the effective tax rate was 295 percent for 2002 the company estimates the effective tax rate will be approximately 295 percent during 2003 subject to structural and operational changes the impact of acquisitions and the geographic mix of income 

  

international operations constitute approximately 45 percent of the company’s business the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes to foreign exchange rates will impact the company’s financial results 

  

weakness in the equity markets and the lower interest rate environment resulted in modifications to the company’s 2002 pension assumptions negatively impacting pretax operating income by 4 million in 2002 compared with 2001 continued weakness in the equity markets and the lower interest rate environment have resulted in adjustments of the 2003 pension assumptions and as a result of these changes forecasted pension expense for 2003 is expected to negatively impact pretax operating income by approximately 10 million relative to 2002 

  

the 2003 weightedaverage assumptions for return on plan assets and discount rate for us pension plans are 9 percent and 7 percent respectively the 2003 weightedaverage assumptions for return on plan assets and discount rate for international plans are 66 percent and 55 percent respectively 

  

the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangibles” at the beginning of fiscal 2002 benefited earnings per share assuming dilution by approximately 14 in 2002 under this accounting standard the company no longer amortizes goodwill amortization expense related to intangible and other assets increased approximately 9 million in fiscal 2002 as a result of increases in capitalized software deferred charges and from identifiable intangibles resulting from the 2002 acquisitions a full year of amortization expense for the identifiable intangibles from the 2002 acquisitions is expected to be approximately 4 million in 2003 

  

the company expects continued growth in 2003 during the year the company will be introducing new products in both the pressuresensitive adhesives and materials and the consumer and converted products segments the company also expects growth from acquisitions completed in 2002 the company has reduced costs and will continue its cost management initiatives designed to improve margins the company continues to pursue longterm growth initiatives with emphasis on new product development and growth in emerging markets particularly in the asia pacific latin american and eastern european regions

sales increased 106 percent to 421 billion in 2002 compared to 38 billion in 2001 excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates sales increased 10 percent in 2001 sales decreased 23 percent over 2000 sales of 389 billion excluding the impact of currency sales decreased 6 percent in 2001 acquisitions made in each of the years 2002 2001 and 2000 contributed additional sales of approximately 270 million in 2002 843 million in 2001 and 971 million in 2000 the contribution from acquisitions in 2002 can only be estimated given the integration of the jackstädt acquisition with the company’s existing business 

  

gross profit margins for the years ended 2002 2001 and 2000 were 322 percent 326 percent and 342 percent respectively the company’s gross profit margins for individual products within business units can vary significantly the decrease in 2002 was due to the lower gross profit margin on the jackstädt business partially offset by reduced expenses from the cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives the decrease in 2001 was due to lower sales in the highermargin office products business a shift in sales within the roll materials business to lowermargin products as well as a resulting increase in fixed costs as a percentage of sales across most of the company’s businesses because fixed costs were not reduced commensurate with the overall decline in sales 

  

marketing general and administrative expense as a percent of sales was 217 percent in 2002 218 percent in 2001 and 219 percent in 2000

company’s operations in europe latin america asia and north america jackstädt enhances the company’s international presence and enables it to offer a broader selection of products and services integration of the jackstädt business is progressing with the reduction at year end of approximately 315 of the estimated 1000 positions to be eliminated 

  

the company recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 relating to cost reduction actions the 2002 charge involved cost reduction programs and the reorganization of manufacturing and administrative facilities in both of the company’s operating segments the cost reduction efforts resulted in a pretax charge of 107 million which consisted of employee severance and related costs for approximately 300 positions worldwide this charge is shown in the “other expense” line in the consolidated statement of income the positions eliminated included approximately 80 employees in the pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment and approximately 220 employees in the consumer and converted products segment severance and related costs represented cash paid or to be paid to employees terminated under the program at year end 2002 98 million remained accrued for severance and related costs included in “accrued payroll and employee benefits” in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2002 of the approximate 300 positions affected by these actions approximately 50 employees 10 employees from the consumer and converted products segment and 40 employees from the pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment had left the company the company expects to complete this cost reduction program in 2003

the table below details the lease cancellation cost activity 

  

   

in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company sold its specialty coatings business reported within the pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment cash proceeds and 115 million in notes and receivables were received as part of the sale which resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 202 million net sales from this business were 267 million for ten months in 2001 and 377 million in 2000 

  

the company also recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 relating to cost reduction actions the 2001 charge involved cost reduction programs and the reorganization of manufacturing and administrative facilities in both of the company’s operating segments the cost reduction efforts resulted in a pretax charge of 199 million which consisted of employee severance and related costs of 131 million for approximately 

  

400 positions worldwide and asset impairments of 68 million the positions eliminated included approximately 170 employees in the pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment 210 employees in the consumer and converted products segment and 20 corporate employees severance and related costs represented cash paid or to be paid to employees terminated under the program asset impairments represented noncash charges required to reduce the carrying value of the assets that were disposed of to net realizable value as of the planned date of disposal at year end 2002 19 million remained accrued for severance and related costs included in “accrued payroll and employee benefits” in the consolidated balance sheet associated with longterm severance contracts which will be paid through 2004 all amounts related to asset impairments were utilized 

  

interest expense for the years ended 2002 2001 and 2000 was 437 million 502 million and 546 million respectively the decrease in 2002 was due to lower interest rates on shortterm floating rate debt partially offset by the additional interest on the debt used to fund the jackstädt acquisition in the second quarter as well as the rvl and le acquisitions in the fourth quarter the decrease in 2001 was due to the impact of lower interest rates on the company’s shortterm debt 

  

income before taxes as a percent of sales was 87 percent in 2002 95 percent in 2001 and 109 percent in 2000 the percentage decrease in 2002 reflected the total third and fourth quarter pretax charges of 321 million and lower gross profit margin as a percent of sales the decrease was partially offset by lower interest expense the elimination of goodwill amortization and lower marketing general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales the percentage decrease in 2001 was primarily due to the lower gross profit margin 

  

the effective tax rate was 295 percent in 2002 324 percent in 2001 and 335 percent in 2000 the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2002 was principally due to structural and other operational changes the impact of acquisitions the geographic mix of income and the change in accounting for goodwill the percentage decrease in 2001 reflected a change in geographic mix of profits utilization of various tax credits worldwide and both structural and operational changes that reduced taxes the company estimates that the effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 295 percent 

  

   

net income totaled 2572 million in 2002 2432 million in 2001 and 2835 million in 2000 net income for 2002 increased 58 percent from 2001 net income for 2001 decreased 142 percent from 2000 net income as a percent of sales was 61 percent 64 percent and 73 percent in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

results of operations by operating segment 

  

pressuresensitive adhesives and materials 

  

   

the pressure sensitive adhesives and materials segment reported increased sales and income for 2002 compared to 2001 sales increased approximately 379 million or 173 percent to 257 billion in 2002 compared to 219 billion in 2001 driven by strong sales in both the domestic and international operations domestic sales including intrasegment sales increased approximately 56 million or 4 percent due to strong sales in the roll materials business approximately 92 million the increase resulted in part from market share gain from business obtained from the closure of a competitor’s plant estimated to be 11 million and a supply agreement with a company that outsourced its manufacturing of certain roll label materials estimated to be 23 million as well as other factors including industry consolidation new products and service programs and new applications additionally domestic sales increased due to an increase in the specialty tapes business approximately 8 million driven by the introduction of new applications and products for the medical and industrial markets increases in 2002 sales were partially offset by a reduction in sales from the sale of the specialty coatings business in the fourth quarter of 2001 2001 sales of approximately 27 million as well as sales declines in the graphics and reflective business of approximately 10 million sales increased internationally including intrasegment sales approximately 344 million or 34 percent principally due to the acquisition of jackstädt in the second quarter of 2002 total 2002 impact on sales estimated to be approximately 262 million in addition excluding sales from the jackstädt business international sales reflected strong sales growth in roll materials asia approximately 34 million and higher sales in the roll materials and graphics businesses in europe approximately 33 million due to a favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the segment’s income increased 31 percent to 198 million compared to 2001 income from domestic operations was down slightly approximately 4 million compared to 2001 the decrease in income from domestic operations in 2002 reflected a charge of approximately 9 million related to the 2002 restructuring asset impairments and lease cancellation costs compared to a charge of 39 million for cost reduction actions in 2001 and a 202 million pretax gain on the sale of a business in 2001 excluding the impact of these items income from domestic operations increased approximately 21 million or 20 percent this was primarily due to higher income in the roll materials business driven by volume growth and profitability achieved through cost reduction and productivity improvement programs additionally domestic income reflected the benefit from the change in accounting for goodwill approximately 4 million income from international operations increased approximately 10 million due to sales growth improved profitability achieved through cost reductions and productivity gains and the positive impact from the change in accounting for goodwill amortization approximately 2 million international income was reduced by a charge of approximately 13 million related to the 2002 restructuring asset impairments and lease cancellation costs 

  

the pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment reported an increase in sales and a decrease in income for 2001 compared to 2000 sales increased 25 percent to 219 billion in 2001 compared to 214 billion in 2000 driven by market share gain in the us and growth in international markets sales increased in the us operations due to the acquisition of dunsirn industries inc “dunsirn” as discussed below approximately 48 million the benefit of new business obtained from the closure of a competitor’s plant estimated to be 10 million and a new supply agreement with a company that outsourced its manufacturing of certain roll label materials estimated to be 12 million and other factors the domestic sales increase was partially offset by the slowdown in the north american economy and the resulting negative impact on sales in the graphics and specialty tapes businesses approximately 31 million sales increased internationally primarily as a result of the adespan acquisition in 2000 as discussed below approximately 19 million and unit 

  

volume growth in the roll materials business in europe and asia pacific this increase was partially offset by a slowdown in certain european markets served by the company’s graphics and specialty tapes businesses sales declines in latin america and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates approximately 46 million 

  

the segment’s 2001 income decreased 96 percent to 1921 million from 2000 income for 2001 was impacted by three nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter a pretax gain of approximately 202 million on the sale of a business in the us a 76 million charge relating to cost reduction actions 39 million in the us operations and 37 million in the international operations and a 23 million charge related to the currency devaluation in argentina income in the us and international operations also decreased due to the economic slowdown which impacted sales across most of the segment’s businesses in addition integration costs associated with the dunsirn acquisition the negative impact on gross profit margins from a reduced ratio of sales to fixed costs in a more competitive pricing environment and onetime costs associated with the startup of a new coater in the us also contributed to the income reduction savings from cost reduction actions taken throughout the year as well as from six sigma partially offset the negative effects of these factors 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company sold its specialty coatings business cash proceeds and 115 million in notes and receivables were received in conjunction with the sale which resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 202 million net sales from this business were 267 million for ten months in 2001 and 377 million in 2000 

  

in the first quarter of 2001 the company acquired dunsirn a supplier of nonadhesive materials to the narrowweb printing industry as well as a provider of customized slitting and distribution services for pressuresensitive roll materials manufacturers customized slitting and distribution services refer to the process of cutting bulk rolls of material into sizes requested by customers and then shipping these materials to customers sales in 2000 for dunsirn were approximately 68 million including sales to the company the excess of the cost basis over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired was 308 million which included identified intangible assets of 55 million 

  

in the first quarter of 2000 the company acquired the adespan pressuresensitive materials operation of panini spa a european printing and publishing company based in italy adespan had sales of approximately 75 million in 1999 the excess of the cost basis over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired was 254 million which included identified intangible assets of 124 million 

  

consumer and converted products 

  

   

the consumer and converted products segment reported increased sales and income for 2002 compared to 2001 sales increased approximately 28 million or 16 percent to 181 billion compared to 178 billion in 2001 sales in the domestic operations including intrasegment sales increased approximately 22 million principally due to increases in the retail information services group approximately 13 million including the operations of rvl and le acquired in the fourth quarter which contributed approximately 9 million in sales and strong sales in the industrial and automotive products business approximately 75 million sales from the us office products business were flat in 2002 compared to 2001 the office products environment has been challenging over the past two years with superstores closing stores and reducing inventory while white collar layoffs have reduced enduser demand sales from international operations including intrasegment sales increased approximately 24 million or 4 percent principally due to the acquisitions of rvl and le in the fourth quarter which contributed incremental sales of approximately 26 million additionally the international businesses benefited from strong sales growth in the ticketing business in asia approximately 15 million 

  

  

the segment’s 2002 income was comparable to 2001 income from domestic operations decreased approximately 4 million which included a charge of 6 million related to restructuring asset impairments and lease cancellation costs in 2002 and a benefit from the change in accounting for goodwill approximately 5 million income from international operations increased approximately 5 million driven principally by strong sales in the ticketing business in asia approximately 7 million results from the international operations also included a charge of 4 million related to restructuring asset impairments and lease cancellation costs in 2002 and the positive impact from the change in accounting for goodwill approximately 4 million 

  

the consumer and converted products segment reported decreased sales and income for 2001 compared to 2000 sales decreased 6 percent to 178 billion in 2001 compared to 19 billion in 2000 sales in the us operations were negatively impacted by several factors the slowdown in the north american economy particularly affected the company’s office products business and the industrial and automotive business customer inventory reductions consolidation of office product retail stores by the company’s customers and a weak retail environment also negatively impacted sales in 2001 domestic sales for the office products business were also negatively impacted by purchases of approximately 14 million made by major customers in december 2000 in order to increase the payout under rebate programs which accelerated sales that normally would have occurred in the first quarter of 2001 in addition domestic sales growth was negatively impacted by decreased volume and a shift to sales of lowermargin products in the company’s converting businesses sales in international operations decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the economic slowdown impacting some of the company’s businesses in europe 

  

the segment’s 2001 income decreased 166 percent to 2444 million income for 2001 was impacted by a 94 million charge relating to cost reduction actions 54 million in the us operations and 4 million in the international operations the decline in operating income was disproportionate to the decline in sales after the cost reduction charge because fixed costs were not reduced commensurate with the overall decline in sales cost reduction actions and productivity initiatives partially offset the negative impact of the sales decline 

  

in the first quarter of 2001 the company acquired cd stomper a product line consisting of cd and dvd labels software and a label applicator from stomp inc a software developer and manufacturer based in california sales in 2000 for the cd stomper product line were approximately 20 million the excess of the costbasis over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired was 226 million which included identified intangible assets of 97 million 

  

financial condition 

  

the discussion of working capital in this section is based upon average working capital employed during the year in the “liquidity and capital resources” section below the discussion of working capital changes is based upon the beginning and ending balances for the year 

  

average working capital excluding shortterm debt as a percent of sales was 71 percent in 2002 79 percent in 2001 and 64 percent in 2000 the decrease in 2002 was principally due to higher balances in accounts payable and other current liabilities approximately 270 million including amounts resulting from acquisitions approximately 105 million increased balances in accounts payable approximately 64 million hedge liabilities approximately 38 million accrued payroll and benefits approximately 34 million and accrued rebates approximately 18 million the increase in 2001 reflected the increase in cash and the decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities average inventory turnover was 86 turns in 2002 and 88 turns in 2001 and 2000 the decrease in inventory turns in 2002 was due to higher inventory levels driven by the 2002 acquisitions and higher inventory levels in response to stronger sales during the year the average number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 61 days in 2002 58 days in 2001 and 56 days in 2000 the increase in 2002 and 2001 reflected longer payment terms associated with increased international sales the increase in 2002 was also due in part to the longer payment terms associated with the newly acquired businesses although the average number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable has been increasing the company does not anticipate this trend to continue 

  

  

several of the company’s largest domestic customers operate in a competitive retail business environment which has been impacted by the economic conditions in north america as of year end 2002 and 2001 approximately 17 percent and 23 percent respectively of trade accounts receivable were from nine retail customers of the company’s office products business the company does not require its customers to provide collateral but the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

goodwill net of accumulated amortization increased 3355 million during 2002 principally due to the acquisitions of jackstädt approximately 141 million and rvl and le approximately 170 million in addition the increase also reflected a foreign currency exchange impact approximately 9 million 

  

other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions net of accumulated amortization increased 279 million during 2002 due to the acquisitions of jackstädt approximately 11 million and rvl and le approximately 20 million the increase also reflected a foreign currency exchange impact approximately 6 million these increases were partially offset by the amortization expense recorded during 2002 approximately 97 million

shareholders’ equity increased to 106 billion from 9294 million at year end 2001 during 2002 the company issued approximately 743000 shares of the company’s common stock for approximately 47 million in connection with the acquisition of le in addition the company repurchased approximately 173000 shares of company’s common stock at a cost of 108 million as of year end 2002 a cumulative 372 million shares of the company’s common stock had been repurchased since 1991 and 32 million shares remained available for repurchase under the board of directors’ authorization 

  

accumulated other comprehensive loss increased 685 million in 2002 due to an additional pension liability of 872 million for both the us and international pension plans as a result of changes in assumptions and the negative return on plan assets during 2002 in addition accumulated other comprehensive loss reflected an unrealized loss of approximately 374 million that resulted from a shift in interest rates on a forward starting interest rate swap which was used to secure the interest rate on the company’s anticipated longterm debt issuance to finance the acquisition of jackstädt in connection with the issuance of the 250 million senior notes in january 2003 the company settled the interest rate swap at a loss of approximately 325 million these losses were partially offset by the benefit from the change in foreign currency translation during 2002 of approximately 117 million

the company has been designated by the us environmental protection agency epa andor other responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at eight waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed upon the company is participating with other prps at all such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 

  

  

the company has accrued liabilities for all sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the minimum cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and based upon current information management believes that it is unlikely that final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the consolidated financial position and operations of the company

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as described in the “financial condition” section above the discussion of working capital changes in this section is based upon the beginning and ending balances for the year as such this section compares working capital at two distinct points in time rather than the average amounts employed during the year 

  

historically the company’s primary source of capital resources has been cash flows from operations and debt financing augmented in 2002 by a limited stock issuance in conjunction with the le acquisition 

  

the company continues to maintain adequate financing arrangements at competitive rates these financing arrangements consist of commercial paper bank lines of credit callable commercial notes and longterm debt including mediumterm notes in january 2003 the company refinanced 400 million of commercial paper borrowings through the offering of 250 million of senior notes due 2013 and 150 million of senior notes due 2033 

  

net cash flow from operating activities was 5228 million in 2002 3755 million in 2001 and 4099 million in 2000 the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2002 was due to increases in net income and changes in working capital balances reflecting increases in accounts payable and accrued liability balances partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily associated with increases in accounts payable balances 64 million as a result of negotiating longer payment terms with vendors increases in payroll and benefits 34 million as a result of higher bonus accruals and the timing of payroll payments and increases in accrued trade rebates 18 million as a result of increased sales the increase in accounts receivable was driven by higher sales levels and an increase in the average number of days sales outstanding from 58 in 2001 to 61 in 2002 the increase in inventory balances was associated with higher sales levels in 2002 and a slight reduction in inventory turnover due to integration complexities of the acquired businesses the decrease in cash flows for 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in net income while the average number of days sales outstanding in receivables increased during 2001 the ending balance of receivables was lower than the prior year due to unusual customer purchasing patterns in late 2000 that were not repeated during 2001 

  

  

capital expenditures were 1518 million in 2002 and 1354 million in 2001 and were funded primarily through cash flows from operations capital expenditures for 2003 are expected to be in the range of 175 million to 200 million the projected increase in capital expenditures is expected to be funded through operating cash flows 

  

in 2002 the company continued its plan of implementing new information systems software in the company’s existing businesses expenditures related to capitalized software were 201 million in 2002 and 503 million in 2001 expenditures in 2003 related to capitalized software are expected to remain at or below 2002 levels 

  

in 2002 the company completed acquisitions resulting in total cash payments of 3974 million the payments were funded through commercial paper borrowings total commercial paper borrowings at december 28 2002 were 5122 million with a weightedaverage interest rate of 187 percent in january 2003 the company refinanced 400 million of these commercial paper borrowings through the offering of 250 million of 4875 percent senior notes due 2013 and 150 million of 6 percent senior notes due 2033 the aggregate 400 million refinancing was issued under the company’s existing shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in the third quarter of 2001 permitting the company to issue up to 600 million in debt and equity securities after the issuance of the 400 million there is a remaining 200 million available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures repaying redeeming or repurchasing existing debt and for working capital remaining commercial paper borrowings that the company does not intend to repay within the next year and had the ability to refinance under its longterm revolving credit agreement discussed below are classified as longterm liabilities

in december 2002 the company issued 150 million oneyear callable commercial notes at a weightedaverage interest rate of 25 percent the issuance replaced the december 2001 issuance of 150 million of oneyear callable commercial notes at a weightedaverage interest rate of 21 percent 

  

the company’s longterm debt including mediumterm notes was 9137 million and 6471 million at the end of 2002 and 2001 respectively maturities of longterm debt during the years 2003 through 2007 are 765 million classified as current 865 million 761 million 1126 million and 604 million respectively with 5016 million maturing thereafter 

  

the company had mediumterm notes of 388 million and 448 million at year end 2002 and 2001 respectively mediumterm notes have maturities from 2003 through 2025 and accrue interest at fixed rates

commitment fees relating to financing arrangements are not significant the debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of jackstädt is securitized by the acquired assets at december 28 2002 the total jackstädt debt balance was approximately 332 million 

  

the fair value of the company’s debt is estimated based on the discounted amount of future cash flows using the current rates offered to the company for debts of the same remaining maturities at year end 2002 and 2001 the fair value of the company’s total debt including shortterm borrowings was 118 billion and 8576 million respectively

the company guaranteed 3493 million of its foreign subsidiaries’ lines of credit and foreign exchange lines as well as 159 million of its foreign subsidiaries’ certain obligations to their suppliers as of december 28 2002 

  

credit ratings are a significant factor in the company’s ability to raise shortterm and longterm financing when determining a credit rating the rating agencies place significant weight on the company’s competitive position consistency of cash flows debt level geographic dispersion and management team 

  

the ratings assigned to the company also impact the interest rates on its commercial paper and other borrowings subsequent to the announcement of the rvl and le acquisitions standard  poor’s rating services “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” reviewed the company’s debt ratings sp reaffirmed the company’s “a1” shortterm rating “a” longterm rating and “negative” outlook moody’s downgraded the company’s shortterm rating from “p1” to “p2” and its longterm rating from “a2” to “a3” and changed the outlook for the company from “negative” to “stable” the downgrade will increase interest rates on the company’s debt beginning in 2003 based on current interest rates and the current level of debt the increased interest cost associated with the downgrade is estimated to have an aftertax impact in the range of approximately 1 million to 3 million per year 

  

in the first quarter of 1999 the company recorded an obligation associated with the transaction with steinbeis holding gmbh which combined substantially all of the company’s office products businesses in europe with zweckform büroprodukte gmbh a german office products supplier the obligation of 845 million is the only amount reported in the “other longterm obligation” line in the consolidated balance sheet the obligation is guaranteed by a standby letter of credit and it is the intention of the company to pay the entire obligation in early 2004

the company continues to expand its operations in europe latin america and asia pacific the company’s future results are subject to changes in political and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates in 2002 sales were favorably impacted by currency fluctuations approximately 20 million in 2001 changes in exchange rates such as for the euro and pound sterling negatively impacted the company the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income is smaller than the impact on net sales because the company’s products are generally sourced in the currencies in which they are sold specifically a negative impact of foreign rates on sales would be matched with a partially offsetting positive impact on reported expenses thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations the company may enter into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts and interest rate contracts where appropriate and available 

  

  

all translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies were included in net income operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years operations in hyperinflationary economies consist of the company’s operations in turkey for 2002 2001 and 2000 these operations were not significant to the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses actual results could differ from those amounts 

  

critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and which require management to make difficult subjective andor complex judgements critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown the company believes that critical accounting policies include accounting for sales rebates accounting for allowances for doubtful accounts and accounting for inventory reserves 

  

sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which the company operates volume promotional price cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales rebates and discounts are recorded based upon management’s best estimates when products are sold these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products management reviews such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available 

  

management is required to make judgements based on historical experience and future expectations as to the collectibility of accounts receivable the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value the company records these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount based on the company’s historical experience for issues not yet identified in addition approximately 17 percent and 23 percent of trade receivables were from nine retail customers of the company’s office products business in 2002 and 2001 respectively the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials workinprogress or finished goods inventory reserves are recorded for damaged obsolete excess and slowmoving inventory management uses estimates to record these reserves slowmoving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory

the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes 

  

the company’s policy is not to hold or purchase foreign currency or interest rate contracts for trading purposes 

  

the company’s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk on earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes as a result the company enters into foreign exchange forward option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of its existing foreign currency assets liabilities firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company’s consolidated net income 

  

the company’s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve its objectives the company will periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowings the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap in may 2002 to secure the interest rate on the company’s anticipated longterm debt issuance the principal amount hedged was 250 million because of a shift in interest rates an unrealized loss of approximately 374 million was included in other comprehensive loss at the end of 2002 in connection with the issuance of the 250 million 10year senior notes the company settled the interest rate swap at a loss of approximately 325 million the loss will be amortized to interest expense over 10 years which corresponds to the term of the related debt 

  

in the normal course of operations the company also faces other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions other risks associated with foreign operations commodity price risk and litigation risks which are not represented in the analyses that follow 

  

  

foreign exchange valueatrisk 

  

the company uses a “valueatrisk” var model to determine the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in earnings associated with both its foreign exchange positions and contracts this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions firm commitments receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were included in the model forecasted transactions which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model the var was estimated using a variancecovariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on twoyear historical data obtained from one of the company’s domestic banks a 95 percent confidence level was used for a oneday time horizon 

  

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by the company nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors

 item 1 business 

  

avery dennison corporation “registrant” was incorporated in 1977 in the state of delaware as avery international corporation the successor corporation to a california corporation of the same name which was incorporated in 1946 in 1990 registrant merged one of its subsidiaries into dennison manufacturing company “dennison” as a result of which dennison became a wholly owned subsidiary of registrant and in connection with which registrant’s name was changed to avery dennison corporation 

  

the business of registrant and its subsidiaries registrant and its subsidiaries are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “company” includes the production of pressuresensitive adhesives and materials and the production of consumer and converted products some pressuresensitive adhesives and materials are “converted” into labels and other products through embossing printing stamping and diecutting and some are sold in unconverted form as base materials tapes and reflective sheeting the company also manufactures and sells a variety of consumer and converted products and other items not involving pressuresensitive components such as notebooks threering binders organizing systems markers fasteners business forms reflective highway safety products tickets tags and imprinting equipment 

  

a pressuresensitive or selfadhesive material is one that adheres to a surface by mere presson contact it generally consists of four elements—a face material which may include paper metal foil plastic film or fabric an adhesive which may be permanent or removable a release coating and a backing material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with other surfaces and which can also serve as the carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels when the products are to be used the release coating and protective backing are removed exposing the adhesive and the label or other face material is pressed or rolled into place 

  

selfadhesive materials may initially cost more than materials using heat or moisture activated adhesives but the use of selfadhesive materials often effects cost savings because of their easy and instant application without the need for adhesive activation they also provide consistent and versatile adhesion minimum adhesive deterioration and are available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size shape or color 

  

international operations principally in western europe constitute a significant portion of the company’s business in addition the company is currently expanding its operations in asia pacific latin america and eastern europe as of december 29 2001 the company manufactured and sold its products from approximately 200 manufacturing facilities and sales offices located in 42 countries and employed a total of approximately 17300 persons worldwide 

  

on september 7 2001 the company announced an agreement to acquire the jackstädt gmbh pressuresensitive adhesive materials business jackstädt is a privatelyheld manufacturer of pressuresensitive adhesive materials based in germany jackstädt with consolidated revenues of approximately 400 million in 2000 has a global customer base and generates approximately 80 percent of its sales outside of germany the transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions including regulatory approvals completion of the acquisition had been delayed pending further review by the german federal cartel office which has raised specific issues with respect to market definition and market share in that country the company is responding to the concerns but the timing and ultimate outcome of the final regulatory review remain uncertain as of year end 2001 the company had capitalized approximately 9 million for direct costs related to this pending acquisition if these issues cannot be overcome the proposed transaction may be renegotiated or terminated in which case some or all of these costs may be expensed depending on the outcome of the regulatory review 

  

the company also recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 relating to cost reduction actions the 2001 charge involves cost reduction programs and the reorganization of manufacturing and administrative facilities in both of the company’s operating segments the cost reduction efforts resulted in a pretax charge of 199 million which consisted of employee severance and related costs of 131 million for approximately 400 positions worldwide and asset write downs of 68 million see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis results of operations page 7 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company recorded a pretax charge of approximately 26 million related to the currency devaluation in argentina operations in argentina are not significant to the company’s financial results and represented less than 25 million in sales in 2001 the majority of the company’s operations in argentina are reported in the pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment 

  

the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and is subject to certain risks referred to in exhibit 99 hereto including those normally attending international and domestic operations such as changes in economic or political conditions currency fluctuation exchange control regulations and the effect of international relations and domestic affairs of foreign countries on the conduct of business legal proceedings and the availability and pricing of raw materials 

  

except as set forth below no material part of the company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers however sales and related accounts receivable of the company’s us consumer products business are concentrated in a small number of major customers principally discount office products superstores and distributors see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements on page 41 of the 2001 annual report which is incorporated by reference united states export sales are not a significant part of the company’s business backlogs are not considered material in the industries in which the company competes

threeyear summary of segment information 

  

the business segment information and financial information by geographical areas of the company’s operations for the three years ended december 29 2001 which appear in note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 46 and 47 of the 2001 annual report are incorporated herein by reference 

  

other matters 

  

the raw materials used by the company are primarily paper plastic and chemicals which are purchased from a variety of commercial and industrial sources and are subject to pricing fluctuations although from time to time shortages could occur these raw materials are currently generally available 

  

at present the company produces a majority of its selfadhesive materials using nonsolvent technology however a significant portion of the company’s manufacturing process for selfadhesive materials utilizes certain evaporative organic solvents which unless controlled would be emitted into the atmosphere emissions of these substances are regulated by agencies of federal state local and foreign governments during the past decade the company has invested over 200 million in solvent capture and control units and solventfree systems installation of these units and systems have substantially reduced atmospheric hydrocarbon emissions 

  

efforts have been directed toward development of new adhesives and solventfree adhesive processing systems emulsion hotmelt adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in the company’s facilities in peachtree city georgia fort wayne and greenfield indiana quakertown pennsylvania rodange luxembourg turnhout belgium hazerswoude the netherlands cramlington england and gotha germany as well as other plants in the united states argentina australia brazil china colombia france germany india korea and thailand 

  

based on current information the company does not believe that the costs of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company 

  

for information regarding the company’s potential responsibility for cleanup costs at certain hazardous waste sites see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 and “management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” part ii item 7 

  

item 2 properties 

  

at december 29 2001 the company operated approximately 34 principal manufacturing facilities in excess of 100000 square feet and totaling approximately 5 million square feet the following sets forth the locations of such principal facilities and the operating segments for which they are presently used 

  

pressuresensitive adhesives and materials segment 

  

 

  

 

  

consumer and converted products segment 

  

 

  

 

  

in addition to the company’s principal manufacturing facilities described above the company’s other principal facilities include its corporate headquarters facility and research center in pasadena california and offices located in maidenhead england leiden the netherlands concord ohio and framingham massachusetts 

  

all of the company’s principal properties identified above are owned in fee except the facilities in juarez mexico and la monnerie france which are leased 

  

all of the buildings comprising the facilities identified above were constructed after 1954 except parts of the framingham massachusetts plant and office complex all buildings owned or leased are well maintained and of sound construction and are considered suitable and generally adequate for the company’s present needs the company plans to expand capacity and provide facilities to meet future increased demand as needed owned buildings and plant equipment are insured against major losses from fire and other usual business risks the company knows of no material defects in title to or significant encumbrances on its properties except for certain mortgage liens 

  

item 3 legal proceedings 

  

the company like other us corporations has periodically received notices from the us environmental protection agency “epa” and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a potentially responsible party “prp” for past 

  

and future cleanup costs at hazardous waste sites the company has been designated by the epa andor other responsible state agencies as a prp at nine waste disposal or waste recycling sites which are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil andor groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the company’s liability has been agreed upon litigation has been initiated by a governmental authority with respect to one of these sites but the company does not believe that any such proceedings will result in the imposition of monetary sanctions the company is participating with other prps at all such sites and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities the company has accrued liabilities for all sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the minimum cost or amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated however because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities future expense to remediate the currently identified sites and sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued amounts currently accrued are not significant to the consolidated financial position of the company and based upon current information management believes that it is unlikely that final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the consolidated financial position and operations of the company 

  

the registrant and its subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits claims and inquiries most of which are routine to the nature of the business in the opinion of the company’s management the resolution of these matters will not materially affect the company
