the market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment a few customers drive significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customer’s supply partners we expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future 

in 2021 revenue in our test businesses exceeded our plan as a result of increased semiconductor test demand and broadbased growth in our wireless test and storage test businesses in 2022 we expect lower demand in our semiconductor test business due to a slower technology transition in one of our largest endmarkets

we expect this demand to accelerate in 2023 as a result of the expected ramp in volume production of semiconductor devices using 3 nanometer manufacturing technology 

 

our industrial automation segment consists of universal robots as “ur” a leading supplier of collaborative robotic arms mobile industrial robots as “mir” a leading maker of amrs for industrial automation and autoguide llc “autoguide” a maker of high payload amrs the market for our industrial automation segment products is dependent on the adoption of new automation technologies by large manufacturers as well as small and medium enterprises “smes” throughout the world 

in 2021 our industrial automation segment returned to growth following the global industrial downturn as well as the impact of the covid19

pandemic in 2020 we expect our ur and mir businesses to continue to grow in 2022 while our autoguide business will focus on continuing to invest to scale and integrate high payload amr solutions 

our corporate strategy continues to focus on profitably gaining market share in our test businesses through the introduction of differentiated products that target expanding segments and accelerating growth through continued investment in our industrial automation businesses we plan to execute on our strategy while balancing capital allocations between returning capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends and using capital for opportunistic acquisitions

sales and distribution 

in 2021 and 2020 revenues from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd a customer of our semiconductor test segment accounted for 12 and 15 respectively of our consolidated revenues in 2019 no single direct customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in each of the years 2021 2020 and 2019 our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 33 36 and 27 of our consolidated revenues respectively 

osat customers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd often purchase our test systems based upon recommendations from oems idms and fabless companies in all cases when an osat customer purchases a test system from us we consider the osat as the customer since credit risk title and risk of loss among other things are between teradyne and the osat we estimate consolidated revenues driven by one oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include 

 

taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd accounted for approximately 19 25 and 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the loss of or significant decrease in demand from this oem customer or any of our five largest direct customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we estimate consolidated revenues driven by huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” combining direct sales to huawei with sales to huawei’s osats accounted for approximately 0 3 and 11 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we have sales and service offices located throughout north america central america asia and europe we sell in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force except for industrial automation products which are sold principally through distributors our manufacturing activities for our test businesses are primarily conducted through subcontractors and outsourced contract manufacturers with significant operations in china and malaysia the manufacturing activities for our industrial automation businesses are done primarily in our production facilities in denmark and the us 

sales to customers outside the united states were 89 90 and 85 respectively of our consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site 

see also “item 1a risk factors” and note t “operating segment geographic and significant customer information” in notes to consolidated financial statements

backlog 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 our backlog of unfilled orders in our four reportable segments was as follows 

 

 

 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without advanced notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers some of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we have experienced delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain components these delays have impacted and may continue to impact the manufacturing of certain products and the timing of delivery of those products to our customers while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

human capital resources 

we believe that our future success depends upon our continued ability to attract develop and retain a highperformance workforce comprised of people with shared values as of december 31 2021 we employed approximately 5900 employees of whom approximately 2000 were employed in the united states and approximately 3900 were employed outside of the united states our largest nonus

employee populations are in the philippines 16 china 11 denmark 11 costa rica 6 and taiwan 6 we also leverage contractors to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs as of december 31 2021 we worked with approximately 400 contractors globally since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances 

corporate culture 

our core values are conducting business with honesty and integrity collaborating with our colleagues as a company without doors and partnering with our customers every step of the way because customers count on us

children and grandchildren 

employee engagement 

we conduct regular employee surveys to check in with our global workforce and obtain input on a number of topics the feedback we receive from these surveys helps us assess employee sentiment identify areas of improvement and guides our decisionmaking as it relates to people management in addition ceo mark jagiela and other executives meet with employees on a frequent basis through exchange meetings and quarterly webcasts the exchange meetings allow the executives to directly interact with a small group of employees while the global webcasts enable all employees to engage with senior leaders and ask questions in an open qa session 

we also offer employees an opportunity to network and connect with colleagues who share similar interests this includes groups such as new employees to teradyne woman’s affinity group blue and green for team members that are committed to the environment runner’s affinity group and lgbtq advocates 

 

diversity and inclusion 

we believe in fostering a diverse workforce and equitable and inclusive culture in order to build a stronger and more resilient company for our customers our employees and our communities to support this effort we have a diversity and inclusion charter which was developed by our diversity equity and inclusion “dei” executive subcommittee

and designed to ensure that we build diversity across our workforce in addition in 2021 we have hired our first dei program manager we have established programs for recruiting and hiring candidates from various backgrounds and experiences we have implemented policies regarding gender pay equity and have conducted audits in the united states which have not identified any pay equity issues in the employee populations tested we conduct mandatory deirelated

training program for our employees and offer a wide variety of optional deirelated

training courses as well in 2021 managers participated in mckinsey academy’s “unlocking the potential of women” course we are an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer committed to making employment decisions without regard to race religion ethnicity or national origin gender sexual orientation gender identity or expression age disability protected veteran status or any other characteristics protected by law

health and safety 

the health and safety of our employees is our highest priority we are committed to complying with all applicable regulatory health and safety requirements wherever we operate we conduct internal audits regular reviews and monitoring of regulations to ensure compliance with laws and regulations at the local state province and country levels we ensure workers are provided with the knowledge to perform their jobs safely by deploying mandatory environmental health and safety training we also require contractors to complete safety training prior to working at any teradyne site we monitor track and report common safety metrics such as accidents near misses and illness our injury and illness rate is below the industry average we also provide our employees with a flexible and adjustable workspace which includes reviewing ergonomics issues in the workplace educating employees to selfidentify risks and ensuring they have the work environment they need to do their jobs safely and effectively 

throughout the covid19

pandemic we have focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees at the onset of the pandemic we made the decision to close our offices and implement work from home policies for most employees during this time we have also provided resources to enable employees to effectively manage remote work such as web conferencing and project collaboration solutions and furniture and equipment for athome

offices to protect those employees where offices have opened or whose work requires them to be onsite

we’ve implemented cleaning processes access to personal protection equipment and other protocols to ensure their safety we have encouraged our workforce to become fully vaccinated we have implemented a vaccineortest

policy for us employees who work on site and recommend a similar policy for our nonus

sites subject to local regulations and the availability of vaccines and test kits we have also supported our global workforce by sending regular allemployee

communications providing development opportunities for managers and employees to support effectively working virtually establishing emergency response teams to empower local decisionmaking conducting surveys to check in with employees sharing regular video updates from our leadership team and establishing a welldefined return to work process 

 

regulatory environment 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to international trade business conduct the protection of employee health and safety and the environment 

we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

we are subject to us laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we are required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item for example we must comply with current us department of commerce export control regulations restricting transactions with certain customers in china we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities compliance with these laws has limited our sales and likely will continue to limit sales to certain customers in the future changes in and responses to us trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

risk factors

tableend 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

risks related to the covid19

pandemic 

the novel coronavirus covid19

pandemic has impacted our business and could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows 

the global pandemic of the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19

has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on gatherings or social distancing requirements quarantines shelterinplace

orders vaccination and testing mandates and business limitations and shutdowns these measures have impacted our daytoday

operations and disrupted our business workforce and operations as well as the operations of our customers contract manufacturers and suppliers in the us we have implemented a vaccineortest

policy which will require costs to implement testing protocols and increases the risk of employee attrition the covid19

pandemic and the numerous measures implemented by authorities in response has adversely impacted our results of operations including increasing costs companywide but we cannot accurately estimate the full extent of the impact to our 2021and 2020 financial results or to our future financial results 

the covid19

pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty in our markets the uncertainty resulted in a decrease in orders for our industrial automation products in 2020 and could continue to impact the business for an uncertain period of time the spread of covid19

has caused us to modify our business practices including implementing vaccination testing masking and social distancing policies suspending employee travel requiring most employees to work remotely canceling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers contract manufacturers and suppliers 

we are continuing to monitor the rapidly evolving situation regarding the covid19

pandemic however we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of covid19

which will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with accuracy including but not limited to any new surges of the virus or new strains or variants of the virus the broad availability of effective vaccines further government actions to contain the virus and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

risks associated with teradyne’s markets 

our business is impacted by global and industryspecific economic cycles which are difficult to predict and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient 

capital equipment providers in the electronics semiconductor industries and industrial automation such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries these cycles have resulted in periods of oversupply a trend we believe will continue to occur our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors electronics and other industrial products which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable increased risk of restructuring charges and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues which in each case and together adversely affect our 

 

operating results we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including implementing cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or marketspecific disruptions that might affect our businesses and we may need to take additional or different measures in the future 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics that may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2021 2020 and 2019 our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 33 36 and 27 of consolidated revenues respectively 

we estimate consolidated revenues driven by one oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd accounted for approximately 19 25 and 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we estimate consolidated revenues driven by huawei combining direct sales to huawei with sales to huawei’s osats accounted for approximately 0 3 and 11 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china malaysia and denmark and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan china korea and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political health or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

risks related to teradyne’s finances 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

in june 2015 we acquired universal robots in 2018 we acquired energid and mir and in 2019 we acquired lemsys and autoguide we may not be able to realize the benefits of acquiring or successfully growing 

 

these businesses we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime

charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets or adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash incurring debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue authorities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy that could be adversely affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws tax regulations or an adverse tax ruling by administrative authorities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material change in our tax liability resulting from changes in tax laws tax regulations administrative ruling or from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue authority could negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased

taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives and tax holidays no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify or fail to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in december 2015 we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended until december 31 2020 our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2015 in november 2020 we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2020 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2025 

the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were 333 million or 018 per diluted share 299 million or 016 per diluted share and 151 million or 008 per diluted share respectively these tax savings may not be achievable in subsequent years due to changes in singapore’s tax laws or the expiration of the tax holiday 

in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to maintain or obtain a foreign tax incentive or tax holiday in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary 

 

and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note m “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program 

in january 2014 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend since 2014 the board of directors has increased our quarterly cash dividend from 006 per share to 011 per share holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors 

in january 2015 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program from january 2015 to april 2020 we repurchased 21 billion of common stock due to the uncertainty regarding the duration severity and business impact of the covid19

pandemic we suspended the stock repurchase program as of april 1 2020 in january 2021 our board of directors approved a new 20 billion share repurchase program in 2021 we repurchased 6000 million of common stock under the share repurchase program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program 

future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness 

on december 12 2016 we completed a private offering of 4600 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 and received net proceeds after issuance costs of approximately 4508 million 330 million of which was used to pay the net cost after being partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the warrants of the convertible note hedge transactions and 501 million of which was used to repurchase 20 million shares of our common stock holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving us or the holders may elect to convert into shares of our common stock as of february 23 2022 eighty three holders had converted 3626 million worth of notes 

on may 1 2020 we entered into a threeyear senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 4000 million on december 10 2021 the credit agreement was amended to extend maturity date of the credit facility to december 10 2026 the amended credit agreement provides that subject to customary conditions we may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders the available incremental amount under the credit facility not to exceed the greater of 2000 million or 15 of consolidated ebidta we could borrow funds under this credit facility at any time for general corporate purposes and working capital as of february 23 2022 we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility 

the issuance of the notes and any additional indebtedness among other things could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies 

the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability among other things to incur additional secured indebtedness sell transfer license or dispose of assets consolidate or merge enter into transactions with our affiliates and incur liens in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest such as subject to permitted exceptions making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds making investments loans and other advances and prepaying any additional indebtedness while our indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility is outstanding our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness 

our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the “note hedge transactions” with the initial purchasers or their affiliates the “option counterparties” the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the notes with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes of 3152 the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 44 million shares of our common stock on november 4 2021 we made an irrevocable election under the indenture to require the principal portion of the remaining notes to be settled in cash 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties the “warrant transactions” in which we sold netsharesettled

or at our election subject to certain conditions cashsettled warrants to the option counterparties the warrant transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 146 million shares of our common stock the strike price of the warrants is 3955 per share the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants 

the note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants the net cost of the note hedge transactions after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 330 million 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the option counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor purchase shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the option counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

 

we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 

if our cash flows are inadequate to meet our obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of our other obligations we would be in default under the terms thereof which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial position and operating results in addition we cannot be certain that we would be able to repay amounts due on the notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations or if the holders of the notes require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving us moreover we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 

risks related to operations 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors could impact future operations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

 

if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain of our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

our suppliers are subject to trade regulations including tariffs and export restrictions imposed by the united states government and by the governments of other countries these regulations could impact our suppliers’ ability to provide us with components for our products or could increase the price of those components 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform 

we depend on flex ltd “flex” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facilities in china and starting in 2022 also malaysia plexus corp “plexus” to manufacture and test our magnum products from its facilities in malaysia and starting in 2022 also thailand and ets family of products from its facility in malaysia sam meerkat to manufacture and test our storage test family of products from its facilities in malaysia and thailand and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer the flex facility located in china may be impacted by the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and china by regulations implemented by the united states or china or disruption caused by health pandemics such as the coronavirus 

if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flex plexus sam meerkat or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced certain general and administrative functions to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry we expect intense competition for employees to continue in 2022 our success will depend on our ability to attract and 

 

retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events severe weather widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes typhoons volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

global climate change can result in natural disasters occurring more frequently with greater intensity and with less predictability for example in december 2021 our operations in cebu philippines experienced a devastating typhoon our employees in cebu succeeded in restoring most of our operations within days despite the severity of the damage in the region we have offered support services to many of our employees impacted by the typhoon and have incurred additional costs to maintain our operations following the disaster the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear but could be severe 

the global supply shortage of electrical components may impact our ability to meet customer demand 

there is currently a global supply shortage of electrical components including semiconductor chips as a result we have experienced increases in our lead times and costs for certain components for certain products and delays in the delivery of some orders placed by our customers at this time these supply chain challenges have not had a material impact on our business results of operations or financial condition however if we are unable to secure manufacturing capacities from our current suppliers and contract manufacturers our ability to deliver our products to our customers may be negatively impacted also our suppliers and contract manufacturers may increase their prices which would result in an increase in our manufacturing costs which we may not be fully able to pass to our customers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to intellectual property “ip” and cybersecurity 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our 

 

products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results or cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our ip we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we rely on various information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information including proprietary and confidential data and to carry out and support a variety of business activities including manufacturing research and development supply chain management sales and accounting we have experienced several attempted cyberattacks of our network none of the attempted attacks has caused a disruption to our operations or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial results as a result of the attempts we have taken further preventive security measures to protect our systems despite these preventative security measures we have implemented we may continue to be vulnerable to attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to our networks or sabotage our systems these attempts which might be related to criminal hackers industrial espionage or statesponsored intrusions include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers networks and systems and impersonating authorized users in addition third party suppliers and service providers that we rely on to manage our networks and systems and process and store our proprietary and confidential data may also be subject to similar attacks such attempts could result in the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of teradyne or our employees customers suppliers or other third parties as well as damage to or disruptions in our information technology networks and systems these threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures while we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems may be successful and in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our suppliers and other service providers including as a result of cyberattacks could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology networks and systems 

a breach of the security of our products could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we may be subject to security breaches of certain of our products caused by viruses illegal breakins

or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors a breach of our product security systems could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our products 

risks related to legal and regulatory compliance 

the implementation of tariffs on our products may have a material impact on our business 

our business operations and supply chain are global and may be disrupted by the implementation of tariffs 

 

in 2018 the united states trade representative imposed a 25 tariff on many lists of products including certain teradyne products that are made in china and imported into the united states we have implemented operational changes that mitigate the impact of the 25 tariff on the import of our impacted products into the united states as a result the existing tariff has not had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the implementation of additional tariffs by the united states could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to the actions taken by the united states china has implemented retaliatory tariffs on products made in the united states and imported into china including certain teradyne products we have implemented if appropriate operational changes that would mitigate the impact of the retaliatory tariffs however notwithstanding our efforts the retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions implemented by china could disrupt our business operations sales and supply chain and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

trade regulations and restrictions impact our ability to sell products to and support certain customers which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are subject to us laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances are required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities compliance with these laws has not significantly limited our sales but could significantly limit them in the future changes in and responses to us trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in 2018 the united states department of commerce announced that it has commenced a review of new export controls focusing on emerging and foundational technologies the new export controls could cover technologies used in one or more teradyne products and therefore could impact the sales of certain teradyne products 

the us government from time to time has issued export restrictions that prohibit us companies from exporting us manufactured products foreign manufactured products with more than 25 controlled us content as well as us origin technology for example the us department of commerce has restricted the access of us origin technologies to certain chinese companies by adding those companies to the entity list under us export administration regulations “ear” 

on may 16 2019 huawei and 68 of its affiliates including hisilicon were added to the us department of commerce entity list under the ear this action by the us department of commerce imposes new export licensing requirements on exports reexports

and incountry

transfers of all us regulated products software and technology to the designated huawei entities on august 17 2020 the us department of commerce published final regulations expanding the scope of the us ear to include additional products that would become subject to export restrictions relating to huawei entities including hisilicon these new regulations restrict the sale to huawei and the designated huawei entities of certain nonus

made items such as semiconductor devices manufactured for or sold to huawei entities including hisilicon under specific detailed conditions set forth in the new regulations these new regulations have impacted our sales to huawei hisilicon and their suppliers we are taking appropriate actions including filing license applications and obtaining licenses from the us department of commerce however we do not expect these actions will mitigate the impact of the regulations on our sales to huawei hisilicon and other suppliers as a result the regulations will continue to 

 

have an adverse impact on our business and financial results it is uncertain the extent these new regulations and any additional regulations that may be implemented by the us department of commerce or other government agency may have on our business with other customers or potential customers also our controls related to entity list compliance could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities 

on april 28 2020 the us department of commerce published new export control regulations for certain us products and technology sold to military end users or for military enduse

in china russia and venezuela the definition of military end user is broad the regulations went into effect on june 29 2020 in december 2020 the us department of commerce issued a list of companies in china and other countries that it considered to be military end users we expect that compliance with the new export controls will impact our ability to sell products to certain customers in china in addition the new export controls could disrupt our supply chain increase our compliance costs and impact the demand for our products in china and thus have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations while we maintain an export compliance program our compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities we will continue to assess the impact of the new export controls on our business and operations and take appropriate actions including filing for licenses with the us department of commerce to minimize any disruption however we cannot be certain that the actions we take will mitigate all the risks associated with the new export controls that may impact our business 

in response to the regulations issued by the us department of commerce the chinese government has passed new laws including blocking legislation which may impact our business activities in china the company is assessing the potential impact of these new chinese laws and monitoring relevant laws and regulations issued by the chinese government the impact of these new chinese laws on our business activities in china remains uncertain at this time 

we may be subject to product recalls and warranty and product liability claims 

we invest significant resources in the design manufacturing and testing of our products however from time to time we discover design or manufacturing defects in our products after they have been shipped and as a result we have incurred development and remediation costs and settled warranty and product liability claims in addition when our products contain defects or have reliability quality or safety issues we have conducted a product recall which resulted in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation which could make it more difficult to sell our products we could continue to have warranty and product liability claims or product recalls in the future any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur significant costs of complying with present and future environmental regulations and may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with such environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes in addition future regulations in response to global climate change may affect us our suppliers and our customers such regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us future climate change regulations could result in decreased demand for our products if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2021 we have not incurred material costs as a result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” altered the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative regulatory or governmental proceedings including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we may face risks associated with shareholder activism 

we may become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or divestitures such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price 

provisions of our charter and bylaws

and massachusetts law may make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

the market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment a few customers drive significant demand for our test products both through direct sales and sales to the customers’ supply partners we expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future 

in 2021 revenue in our test businesses exceeded our plan as a result of increased semiconductor test demand and broadbased growth in our wireless test and storage test businesses in 2022 we expect lower demand in our semiconductor test business due to a slower technology transition in one of our largest endmarkets

we expect this demand to accelerate in 2023 as a result of the expected ramp in 3 nanometer volume production 

our industrial automation segment consists of universal robots as “ur” a leading supplier of collaborative robotic arms mobile industrial robots as “mir” a leading maker of amrs for industrial automation and autoguide llc “autoguide” a maker of high payload amrs the market for our industrial automation segment products is dependent on the adoption of new automation technologies by large manufacturers as well as small and medium enterprises smes throughout the world 

in 2021 our industrial automation segment returned to growth following the global industrial downturn as well as the impact of the covid19

pandemic in 2020 we expect our ur and mir businesses to continue to grow in 2022 while our autoguide business will focus on continuing to invest to scale and integrate high payload amr solutions 

our corporate strategy continues to focus on profitably gaining market share in our test businesses through the introduction of differentiated products that target expanding segments and accelerating growth through continued investment in our industrial automation businesses we plan to execute on our strategy while balancing capital allocations between returning capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends and using capital for opportunistic acquisitions 

impact of the covid19

pandemic on our business 

the novel coronavirus covid19

pandemic resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on gatherings or social distancing requirements quarantines shelterinplace

orders vaccination and testing mandates and business limitations and shutdowns these measures have impacted our daytoday

operations and disrupted our business workforce and operations as well as the operations of our customers contract manufacturers and suppliers we are continuing to monitor the rapidly evolving situation regarding the covid19

pandemic and the availability and impact of vaccinations globally however we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of covid19

which will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with accuracy including but not limited to any new surges or new strains or variants of the virus in areas where we do business the availability and use of vaccinations any further government actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

health and safety 

in response to the covid19

pandemic we have taken proactive aggressive action to protect the health and safety of our employees customers contract manufacturers and suppliers and we have complied with all government orders around the globe the spread of covid19

has caused us to modify our business practices 

 

including implementing social distancing protocols suspending employee travel requiring most employees to work remotely cancelling physical participation in meetings and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces around the world the majority of our employees are working from home however some of our engineering operations supply line and customer support teams must be onsite

at our or our customers’ facilities we are providing those onsite

employees with the necessary protective resources and procedures to minimize their exposure risk we may take further actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers contract manufacturers and suppliers 

operations 

we believe the covid19

pandemic and the numerous measures implemented by authorities in response has adversely impacted our results of operations including by increasing costs and in 2020 decreasing demand in our industrial automation businesses but we cannot accurately estimate the amount of the impact to our 2021 and 2020 financial results or to our future financial results in addition the pandemic has disrupted our contract manufacturers and suppliers and has resulted in some instances in shortterm cost increases to meet customer demand while the duration and severity of the pandemic may further impact our workforce and operations as well as those of our customers contract manufacturers and suppliers we expect that our manufacturing facilities will remain operational at sufficient capacity to support production demand we are monitoring our operations closely in an effort to avoid any potential productivity loss caused by responses to the covid19

pandemic 

supply 

we have experienced interruptions to our supply chain as a result of the covid19

pandemic our suppliers have faced and may continue to face difficulties maintaining operations in light of covid19

disruptions and governmentordered restrictions our supply chain team and our suppliers continue to manage numerous supply production and logistics obstacles caused by the pandemic there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful the covid19

pandemic may continue to disrupt our ability to obtain components required to manufacture our products adversely affecting our operations and in some instances resulting in higher costs and delays both for obtaining components and shipping finished goods to customers 

demand 

the covid19

pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty in our markets demand for our test products was strong throughout 2020 and 2021 our industrial automation business however experienced a significant decline in demand through the first half of 2020 due to covid19

related shutdowns affecting global manufacturing but demand recovered in the second half of 2020 from the low point in the second quarter and continued to recover in 2021 the covid19

pandemic could cause further global economic disruption that could cause demand for our products to decline which would adversely affect our business 

liquidity 

although there is continued uncertainty related to the impact of the covid19

pandemic on our future results we believe our business model and our current cash reserves leave us wellpositioned to manage our business through this crisis we have a strong balance sheet as well as an operating model that we believe is capable of flexing up and down with extreme demand swings while still remaining profitable based on our analysis we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and our currently anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months however due to the uncertainty related to the future impact of the covid19

pandemic in order to bolster our liquidity position on may 1 2020 we entered into a credit agreement providing for a threeyear senior secured revolving credit facility of 400 million on december 10 2021 we amended the credit agreement to extend its maturity to december 10 2026 as further described in note j “debt” as of february 23 2022 we have not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

 

we are continuing to monitor the evolving situation regarding the covid19

pandemic the availability of vaccinations where we do business and guidance from government authorities around the world in these circumstances there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan as a result given the uncertain nature of this situation we are not able to accurately predict the full extent of the impact of covid19

on our business financial condition results of operations liquidity or cash flows in the future in addition see part ii—item 1a “risk factors” included herein for updates to our risk factors regarding risks associated with the covid19

pandemic 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a full description of our accounting policies related to the below items refer to note b accounting policies included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 

due to the covid19

pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and our markets we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this annual report on form 10k

critical accounting estimates are complex and may require significant judgment by management changes to the underlying assumptions may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

in accordance with asc 606 “ revenue from contracts with customers” “asc 606”

 we recognize revenues when or as control is transferred to a customer our determination of revenue requires judgment in the determination of performance obligations and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations we often sell bundled orders that include both product and services or multiple different products within the same order we evaluate each of the deliverables to determine if it meets the definition of a performance obligation which requires that it is capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract this determination is based on an assessment of contractual rights of the contract and the ability of the performance obligation to perform on its own or with readily available resources in bundled transactions we estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us including standalone transactions market information and other observable inputs 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost using a standard costing system which approximates cost based on a firstin

firstout

basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we evaluate all inventories for net realizable value this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed within the forecasted demand window is written down to estimated net realizable value forecasted demand information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future consolidated revenues the demand forecast is based on assumptions around the product life and customer and market forecasts 

 

retirement and postretirement plans 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their forecast of asset class return expectations we believe that 24 was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2021 the december 31 2021 asset allocation for our us plan was 94 invested in fixed income securities 5 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the ftse pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 265 at december 31 2021 up from 23 at december 31 2020 we estimate that in 2022 we will recognize approximately 18 million of pension expense for the us plan the us plan pension expense estimate for 2022 is based on a 265 discount rate and a 20 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired we review intangible and longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill impairment of intangible and longlived assets would result in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value the calculated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible or longlived asset is dependent upon discounted cash flow “dcf” models discount rates and market multiples dcf models rely on our forecasted midterm

plans which are subjective based on customer or market conditions and can change materially we utilize third party specialists when determining discount rates and selected market multiples a change in any of these key assumptions could result in a reporting unit intangible asset or longlived asset being impaired in a future period 

convertible debt 

our convertible debt is subject to conversion under certain circumstances upon notification from our note holders at the time of conversion we recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the calculated fair value of the debt immediately prior to its conversion and the carrying amount of the debt component including any unamortized debt discount or issuance costs the key estimate in determining the calculated fair value is the borrowing rate which requires judgment using market data for nonconvertible

debt instruments with similar tenor to the remaining life of our debt 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the 

 

differences are expected to reverse the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized evaluating the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740 “ accounting for income taxes

” is a key judgment in the valuation of income taxes this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities estimates of projected future taxable income and taxplanning

strategies although realization is not assured based on our assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets net of the existing valuation allowance will be realized 

results of operations 

information pertaining to fiscal year 2019 results of operations including a yeartoyear

comparison against fiscal year 2020 was included in our annual report on form 10k

for the year ended december 31 2020 under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations” which was filed with the sec on february 22 2021 this information is incorporated by reference herein 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total net revenues included in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

 

 

revenues 

revenues for our reportable segments were as follows 

 

 

the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 3827 million or 169 was primarily due to greater tester sales driven by testing high performance compute processors and industrial and automotive devices partially offset by lower tester sales for mobile application processors the rise in system test revenues of 580 million or 142 was driven primarily by elevated sales in storage test for system level test demand and greater sales in production board test the increase in industrial automation revenues of 962 million or 344 was driven by demand for collaborative robotic arms and collaborative autonomous mobile robots the rise in wireless test revenues of 439 million or 254 was primarily due to an increase in wifi tester sales and higher demand in ultrawide band wireless test 

our reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues 

 

 

revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 1 

 

 

 

 

 

the breakout of product and service revenues was as follows 

 

 

our product revenues increased 5057 million or 188 primarily due to greater tester sales in semiconductor test driven by testing high performance compute processors and industrial and automotive devices partially offset by lower tester sales for mobile application processors the rise in system test revenues primarily due to elevated sales in storage test for system level test demand and greater sales in production board test increase in industrial automation revenues driven by demand for collaborative robotic arms and collaborative autonomous mobile robots the rise in wireless test revenues due to an increase in wifi tester sales and higher demand in ultrawide band wireless test 

in 2021 and 2020 revenues from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd a customer of our semiconductor test segment accounted for 12 and 15 respectively of our consolidated revenues in 2021 and 2020 our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 33 and 36 of our consolidated revenues respectively 

we estimate consolidated revenues driven by one oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 19 and 25 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

gross profit 

 

 

gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased by 24 points primarily due to product mix of higher margin products in semiconductor test increase in service margins and operating leverage due to higher revenues 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 

 

we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand

and onorder

inventory positions forecasted revenues information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future consolidated revenues this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed within the forecasted demand window is written down to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded an inventory provision of 155 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products of the 155 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 67 million was related to semiconductor test 64 million was related to industrial automation 18 million was related to wireless test and 06 million was related to system test 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded an inventory provision of 175 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products of the 175 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 110 million was related to semiconductor test 48 million was related to wireless test 09 million was related to system test and 08 million was related to industrial automation 

during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we scrapped 109 million and 77 million of inventory respectively and sold 25 million and 23 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff

inventory respectively as of december 31 2021 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff

totaling 1141 million we have no predetermined

timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 

the increase of 828 million in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation and greater selling and administrative spending across all segments 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 

the increase of 526 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending in semiconductor test system test and industrial automation segments and higher variable compensation 

 

restructuring and other 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded 15 million of severance charges primarily in industrial automation 05 million of acquisition related compensation and expenses and 145 million for other expenses offset by a 72 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the autoguide contingent consideration liability 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded a 197 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the autoguide contingent consideration liability and a 35 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the mir contingent consideration liability partially offset by a 40 million contract termination settlement charge 25 million of acquisition related compensation and expenses 23 million of severance charges primarily in industrial automation and 12 million of other expenses 

interest and other 

 

 

interest income decreased by 34 million primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower marketable securities balance in 2021 compared to 2020 interest expense decreased by 64 million primarily due to lower convertible debt interest expense due to early conversions in 2021 other income expense net increased by 154 million primarily due to 288 million of losses on convertible debt conversions in 2021 partially offset by the change in pension actuarial gainslosses from a 103 million loss in 2020 to a 22 million gain in 2021 

income loss before income taxes 

 

 

 

 

the increase in income before income taxes in semiconductor test was primarily due to greater tester sales driven by testing high performance compute processors and industrial and automotive devices partially offset by lower tester sales for mobile application processors the decrease in loss before income taxes in industrial automation was primarily due to demand for collaborative robotic arms and collaborative autonomous mobile robots and lower intangible assets amortization expense the increase in income before income taxes in system test was driven primarily by elevated sales in storage test for system level test demand and greater sales in 

 

production board test the increase in income before income taxes in wireless test was primarily due to an increase in wifi tester sales and higher demand in ultrawide band wireless test the loss before income taxes in corporate and other was primarily due to losses on convertible debt conversions in 2021 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2021and 2020 totaled 1464 million and 1169 million respectively the effective tax rate for 2021 and 2020 was 126 and 130 respectively 

the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2020 to 2021 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the expense from us global lowtaxed

income partially offset by a decrease in the benefit from foreign tax credits and a shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased the income subject to taxation in higher tax rate jurisdictions relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions 

we qualify for a tax holiday in singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the singapore economic development board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2021and 2020 were 333 million or 018 per diluted share and 299 million or 016 per diluted share respectively in november 2020 we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2020 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2025

while we declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future future cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors which will consider among other things our earnings capital requirements and financial condition 

on may 1 2020 we entered into a credit agreement providing a threeyear senior secured revolving credit facility of 400 million on december 10 2021 the credit agreement was amended to extend the senior secured revolving credit facility to december 10 2026 as of february 23 2022 we have not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

we expect operations to continue to be the primary source of cash to operate the business and meet material cash commitments including any payments of convertible debt principal our stock repurchase program our 

 

quarterly dividends our office lease obligations contractual obligations related to inventory purchases and the construction of new facilities we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings at this time the covid19

pandemic has not had an impact on our liquidity but there is no assurance that continued impacts resulting from the pandemic will not have an adverse effect in the future 

at december 31 2021 our future contractual obligations were related to debt leases retirement plan liabilities deferred tax benefits and purchase obligations see note j “debt” note i “leases” note p “retirement plans” and note s “income taxes” of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information about those obligations which notes are incorporated by reference into this section our purchase obligations were approximately 8843 million with 8392 million expected to be paid within 12 months 

retirement plans 

asc 71520

“ compensation—retirement benefits—defined benefit plans

” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520

the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans’ assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

for the year ended december 31 2021 our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus

subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 18 million pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their forecast of asset class return expectations we believe that 24 was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2021 the december 31 2021 asset allocation for our us plan was 94 invested in fixed income securities 5 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the ftse pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 265 at december 31 2021 up from 23 at december 31 2020 we estimate that in 2022 we will recognize approximately 18 million of pension expense for the us plan the us plan pension expense estimate for 2022 is based on a 265 discount rate and a 20 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

 

as of december 31 2021 our pension plans had no unrecognized pension prior service cost 

the assets of the us plan consist substantially of fixed income securities us plan assets have decreased from 1589 million at december 31 2020 to 1496 million at december 31 2021 while the us plan’s liability decreased from 1414 million at december 31 2020 to 1345 million at december 31 2021 in 2021 the decrease in plan assets and plan liability was due to an increase in interest rates in 2020 the accrued pension obligations for approximately 115 retiree participants were transferred to an insurance company and resulted in a 244 million reduction in the pension benefit obligation and pension assets we recorded 22 million of pension actuarial loss and a settlement loss of 05 million related to the retiree group annuity transaction 

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2021 we made contributions of 33 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 10 million to certain qualified plans for nonus

subsidiaries in 2022 we expect to contribute approximately 33 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan contributions to be made in 2022 to certain qualified plans for nonus

subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately 10 million 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note q “stockbased compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in august 2020 the fasb issued asu 202006

– “debt—debt with conversion and other options and derivatives and hedging—contracts in entity’s own equity” which simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments by reducing the number of accounting models and the number of embedded conversion features that could be recognized separately from the primary contract this asu requires a convertible debt instrument to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives this asu requires an entity to use the ifconverted

method in the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments this asu permits the use of either the modified retrospective or fully retrospective method of transition 

 

on november 4 2021 we made an irrevocable election under the indenture to require the principal portion of the remaining notes to be settled in cash upon adoption of asu 202006

only the amounts settled in excess of the principal will be considered in diluted earnings per share under the ifconverted

method we have adopted the standard effective january 1 2022 using the modified retrospective method of transition as a result of adoption we expect to record an entry to increase current debt debt and retained earnings by 15 million 65 million and 928 million respectively mezzanine equity and additional paidin

capital are expected to be reduced by 1008 million combined the adoption of asu 202006

will have an immaterial impact on our results of operations statement of cash flows and earnings per share “eps”

concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale

marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable there were no customers who accounted for more than 10 of our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2020 ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for 25 of our accounts receivable balance the balance was paid in full as of february 22 2021 

in addition to market risks described in our annual report on form 10k

we have an equity price risk related to the fair value of our convertible senior unsecured notes issued in december 2016 in december 2016 teradyne issued 460 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 as of december 31 2021 1170 million of principal remained outstanding and the notes had a fair value of 6046 million the table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10 changes of teradyne’s stock price as of the end of the last quarter of 2021 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the notes the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such event may have on the fair value of the notes the fair value of the notes is subject to equity price risk due to the convertible feature the fair value of the notes will generally increase as teradyne’s common stock price increases and will generally decrease as the common stock price declines in value the change in stock price affects the fair value of the notes but does not impact teradyne’s financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation additionally we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only in connection with the offering of the notes we also sold warrants to the option counterparties these transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes the warrants along with any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the average market price of our common stock for a given reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price or conversion price of the warrants or notes respectively

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in japanese yen british pound korean won taiwan dollar singapore dollar euro philippine peso chinese yuan and danish krone these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily related to shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in the fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2021 and 2020

accidents near misses and illness our injury and illness rate is below the industry average we also provide our employees with a flexible and adjustable workspace which includes reviewing ergonomics issues in the workplace educating employees to selfidentify risks and ensuring they have the work environment they need to do their jobs safely and effectively 

throughout the covid19

pandemic we have focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees at the onset of the pandemic we made the decision to close our offices and implement work from home policies for most employees during this time we have also provided resources to enable employees to effectively manage remote work such as web conferencing and project collaboration solutions and furniture and equipment for athome

offices to protect those employees whose work requires them to be onsite

we’ve implemented cleaning processes access to personal protection equipment and other protocols to ensure their safety we have also supported our global workforce by sending regular allemployee

communications providing development opportunities for managers and employees to support effectively working virtually establishing emergency response teams to empower local decisionmaking conducting surveys to check in with employees sharing regular video updates from our leadership team and establishing a welldefined return to work process 

regulatory environment 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to international trade business conduct the protection of employee health and safety and the environment 

we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

we are subject to us laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item for example we must comply with current us department of commerce export control regulations restricting transactions with certain customers in china we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities compliance with these laws has not significantly limited our sales but could significantly limit them in the future changes in and responses to us trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

risk factors

tableend 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

risks related to the covid19

pandemic 

the novel coronavirus covid19

pandemic has impacted our business and could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows 

the global pandemic of the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19

has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on gatherings or social distancing requirements quarantines shelterinplace

orders and business limitations and shutdowns these measures have impacted our daytoday

operations and disrupted our business workforce and operations as well as the operations of our customers contract manufacturers and suppliers the covid19

pandemic and the numerous measures implemented by authorities in response has adversely impacted our results of operations including increasing costs companywide and decreasing demand in our industrial automation businesses but we cannot accurately estimate the full extent of the impact for our 2020 financial results or to our future financial results 

the covid19

pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty in our markets resulting in a decrease in demand for our industrial automation products the spread of covid19

has caused us to modify our business practices including implementing social distancing protocols suspending employee travel requiring most employees to work remotely canceling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers contract manufacturers and suppliers 

we are continuing to monitor the rapidly evolving situation regarding the covid19

pandemic and the availability of vaccinations where we do business however we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of covid19

which will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with accuracy including but not limited to any new surges of the virus the availability of vaccines further government actions to contain the virus and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

risks associated with teradyne’s markets 

our business is impacted by global and industryspecific economic cycles which are difficult to predict and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient 

capital equipment providers in the electronics semiconductor industries and industrial automation such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries these cycles have resulted in periods of oversupply a trend we believe will continue to occur our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors electronics and other industrial products which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable increased risk of restructuring charges and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues which in each case and together adversely affect our 

 

operating results we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including implementing cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or marketspecific disruptions that might affect our test businesses and we may need to take additional or different measures in the future 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics that may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2020 2019 and 2018 our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 36 27 and 27 of consolidated revenues respectively 

we estimate consolidated revenues driven by one oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd accounted for approximately 25 10 and 13 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we estimate consolidated revenues driven by huawei combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 3 11 and 4 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risks associated with operating a global business 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and malaysia and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan china korea and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political health or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these 

 

international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

risks related to teradyne’s finances 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

in june 2015 we acquired universal robots in 2018 we acquired energid and mir and in 2019 we acquired lemsys and autoguide we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring or successfully growing these businesses we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime

charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash incurring debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue authorities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy that could be adversely affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws tax regulations or an adverse tax ruling by administrative authorities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material change in our tax liability resulting from changes in tax laws tax regulations administrative ruling or from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue authority could negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome

based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives and tax holidays no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in december 2015 we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended until december 31 2020 our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2015 in november 2020 we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2020 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2025 

the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were 299 million or 016 per diluted share 151 million or 008 per diluted share and 119 million or 006 per diluted share respectively these tax savings may not be achievable in subsequent years due to changes in singapore’s tax laws or the expiration of the tax holiday 

 

in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to maintain or obtain a foreign tax incentive or tax holiday in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note m “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program 

in january 2014 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend since 2014 the board of directors has increased our quarterly cash dividend from 006 per share to 010 per share holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors 

in january 2015 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program from january 2015 to april 2020 we repurchased 21 billion of common stock due to the uncertainty regarding the duration severity and business impact of the covid19

pandemic we suspended the stock repurchase program as of april 1 2020 in january 2021 our board of directors approved a new 20 billion share repurchase program under the share repurchase program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program 

future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness 

on december 12 2016 we completed a private offering of 4600 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 and received net proceeds after issuance costs of approximately 4508 million 330 million of which was used to pay the net cost after being partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the warrants of the convertible note hedge transactions and 501 million of which was used to repurchase 20 million shares of our common stock holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving us or the holders may elect to convert into shares of our common stock as of february 22 2021 twentyfour holders had exercised the option to convert 510 million worth of notes 

on may 1 2020 we entered into a threeyear senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 4000 million subject to customary conditions we may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders incremental commitments under the credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 1500 million we have 

 

not borrowed any funds under this credit facility we could borrow funds under this credit facility at any time for general corporate purposes and working capital 

the issuance of the notes and any additional indebtedness among other things could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies 

the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability among other things to incur additional secured indebtedness sell transfer license or dispose of assets consolidate or merge enter into transactions with our affiliates and incur liens in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest such as subject to permitted exceptions making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds making investments loans and other advances and prepaying any additional indebtedness while our indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility is outstanding our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness 

our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the “note hedge transactions” with the initial purchasers or their affiliates the “option counterparties” the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the notes with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes of 3156 the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 146 million shares of our common stock 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties the “warrant transactions” in which we sold netsharesettled

or at our election subject to certain conditions cashsettled warrants to the option counterparties the warrant transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 146 million shares of our common stock the strike price of the warrants is 3960 per share the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants 

the note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants the net cost of the note hedge transactions after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 330 million 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the option counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock 

 

andor purchase shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the option counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 

if our cash flows are inadequate to meet our obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of our other obligations we would be in default under the terms thereof which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial position and operating results in addition we cannot be certain that we would be able to repay amounts due on the notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations or if the holders of the notes require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving us moreover we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 

risks related to operations 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors could impact future operations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

our suppliers are subject to trade regulations including tariffs and export restrictions imposed by the united states government and by the governments of other countries these regulations could impact our suppliers’ ability to provide us with components for our products or could increase the price of those components 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform 

we depend on flex ltd “flex” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china plexus corp “plexus” to manufacture and test our magnum and ets family of products from its facility in malaysia and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer the flex facility in china may be impacted by the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and china by regulations implemented by the united states or china or disruption caused by health pandemics such as the coronavirus 

if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flex plexus or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced certain general and administrative functions to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to intellectual property “ip” and cybersecurity 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results or cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our ip we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we rely on various information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information including proprietary and confidential data and to carry out and support a variety of business activities including manufacturing research and development supply chain management sales and accounting we have experienced several attempted cyberattacks of our network none of the attempted attacks has caused a 

 

disruption to our operations or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial results as a result of the attempts we have taken further preventive security measures to protect our systems despite these preventative security measures we have implemented we may continue to be vulnerable to attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to our networks or sabotage our systems these attempts which might be related to criminal hackers industrial espionage or statesponsored intrusions include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers networks and systems and impersonating authorized users in addition third party suppliers and service providers that we rely on to manage our networks and systems and process and store our proprietary and confidential data may also be subject to similar attacks such attempts could result in the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of teradyne or our employees customers suppliers or other third parties as well as damage to or disruptions in our information technology networks and systems these threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures while we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems may be successful and in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects for example we recently became aware that one of our vendors providing it infrastructure management software solarwinds

corporation had been compromised by cyberattacks although we have not identified any compromise of our it systems due to the use of solarwinds

software to date we continue to monitor our network for any potential impact related to the solarwinds

cyberattack a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our suppliers and other service providers including as a result of the solarwinds

or any other cyberattacks could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology networks and systems 

a breach of the security of our products could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we may be subject to security breaches of certain of our products caused by viruses illegal breakins

or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors a breach of our product security systems could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our products 

risks related to legal and regulatory compliance 

the implementation of tariffs on our products may have a material impact on our business 

our business operations and supply chain are global and may be disrupted by the implementation of tariffs 

in 2018 the united states trade representative imposed a 25 tariff on many lists of products including certain teradyne products that are made in china and imported into the united states we have implemented operational changes that mitigate the impact of the 25 tariff on the import of our impacted products into the united states as a result the existing tariff has not had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the implementation of additional tariffs by the united states could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to the actions taken by the united states china has implemented retaliatory tariffs on products made in the united states and imported into china including certain teradyne products we have implemented if appropriate operational changes that would mitigate the impact of the retaliatory tariffs however notwithstanding our efforts the retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions implemented by china could disrupt our business operations sales and supply chain and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

trade regulations and restrictions impact our ability to sell products to and support certain customers which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are subject to us laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities compliance with these laws has not significantly limited our sales but could significantly limit them in the future changes in and responses to us trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in 2018 the united states department of commerce announced that it has commenced a review of new export controls focusing on emerging and foundational technologies the new export controls could cover technologies used in one or more teradyne products and therefore could impact the sales of certain teradyne products 

the us government from time to time has issued export restrictions that prohibit us companies from exporting us manufactured products foreign manufactured products with more than 25 controlled us content as well as us origin technology for example the us department of commerce has restricted the access of us origin technologies to certain chinese companies by adding those companies to the entity list under us export administration regulations “ear” 

on may 16 2019 huawei and 68 of its affiliates including hisilicon were added to the us department of commerce entity list under the ear this action by the us department of commerce imposes new export licensing requirements on exports reexports

and incountry

transfers of all us regulated products software and technology to the designated huawei entities while most of our products are not subject to the ear and therefore not affected by the entity list restrictions certain of our products are currently manufactured in the us and thus subject to the entity list restrictions the addition of huawei entities including hisilicon to the entity list in may 2019 did not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

on august 17 2020 the us department of commerce published final regulations expanding the scope of the us ear to include additional products that would become subject to export restrictions relating to huawei entities including hisilicon these new regulations restrict the sale to huawei and the designated huawei entities of certain nonus

made items such as semiconductor devices manufactured for or sold to huawei entities including hisilicon under specific detailed conditions set forth in the new regulations these new regulations have impacted our sales to huawei hisilicon and their suppliers we are taking appropriate actions including filing license applications and obtaining licenses from the us department of commerce as well as working with the us regulators to clarify the scope of the restrictions however we cannot be certain that the actions we take will mitigate the risks associated with the new export controls that impact our business it is uncertain the extent these new regulations and any other additional regulations that may be implemented by the us department of commerce or other government agency may have on our business and financial results also our controls related to entity list compliance could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities even if such restrictions are lifted any financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed on huawei could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

on april 28 2020 the us department of commerce published new export control regulations for certain us products and technology sold to military end users or for military enduse in china russia and venezuela the definition of military end user is broad the regulations went into effect on june 29 2020 in december 2020 the us department of commerce issued a list of companies in china and other countries that it considered to be military end users we do not expect that compliance with the new export controls will 

 

significantly impact our ability to sell products to our customers in china or to manufacture products in china the new export controls however could disrupt our supply chain increase our compliance costs and impact the demand for our products in china and thus have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition while we maintain an export compliance program our compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities we will continue to assess the potential impact of the new export controls on our business and operations and take appropriate actions including filing for licenses with the us department of commerce to minimize any disruption however we cannot be certain that the actions we take will mitigate all the risks associated with the new export controls that may impact our business 

in response to the regulations issued by the us department of commerce the chinese government has passed new laws including blocking legislation which may impact our business activities in china the company is assessing the potential impact of these new chinese laws and monitoring relevant laws and regulations issued by the chinese government the impact of these new chinese laws on our business activities in china remains uncertain at this time 

we may be subject to product recalls and warranty and product liability claims 

we invest significant resources in the design manufacture and testing of our products however we may discover design or manufacturing defects in our products after they have been shipped and as a result we may incur development and remediation costs and be required to settle warranty and product liability claims in addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or safety issues we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation which could make it more difficult to sell our products any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2020 we have not incurred material costs as a result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” altered the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities 

 

with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative regulatory or governmental proceedings including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we may face risks associated with shareholder activism 

we may become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or divestitures such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price 

provisions of our charter and bylaws

and massachusetts law may make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors wireless products data storage and complex electronics systems in many industries including consumer electronics wireless automotive industrial computing communications and aerospace and defense industries our industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms autonomous mobile robots “amrs” and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing logistics and light industrial customers to improve quality increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing and logistics costs our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment a few customers drive significant demand for our test products both through direct sales and sales to the customers’ supply partners we expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future 

we have grown our industrial automation business through acquisitions including mobile industrial robots as “mir” a leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots “amrs” for industrial applications in 2018 and autoguide llc “autoguide” a maker of high payload amrs in 2019 the market for our industrial automation products is dependent on the adoption of new automation technologies by large manufacturers as well as small and medium enterprises smes throughout the world in 2020 our industrial automation businesses were negatively impacted by the global industrial downturn as well as the covid19

pandemic 

in 2020 revenue in our test businesses exceeded our plan as a result of semiconductor test demand by our largest customer early 5g test investments and strength in our system test businesses the revenue of our industrial automation business was below our plan in 2021 we expect strong momentum in our test businesses and return to growth for industrial automation 

our strategy is to focus on profitably growing market share in our test businesses the introduction of differentiated products that target growth segments and accelerating growth through continued investment in our industrial automation businesses we plan to execute on our strategy while balancing capital allocations between returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases and using capital for with opportunistic acquisitions 

impact of the covid19

pandemic on our business 

the novel coronavirus covid19

pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on gatherings or social distancing requirements quarantines shelterinplace

orders and business limitations and shutdowns these measures have impacted our daytoday

operations and disrupted our business workforce and operations as well as the operations of our customers contract manufacturers and suppliers we are continuing to monitor the rapidly evolving situation regarding the covid19

pandemic and the availability and impact of vaccinations however we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of covid19

which will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with accuracy including but not limited to any new surges in areas where we do business the availability of vaccinations any further government actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

health and safety 

in response to the covid19

pandemic we have taken proactive aggressive action to protect the health and safety of our employees customers contract manufacturers and suppliers and we have complied with all government orders around the globe the spread of covid19

has caused us to modify our business practices including implementing social distancing protocols suspending employee travel requiring most employees to work remotely cancelling physical participation in meetings and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces around the world the majority of our employees are working from home however some of our engineering operations supply line and customer support teams must be onsite

at our or our customers’ 

 

facilities we are providing those onsite

employees with the necessary protective resources and procedures to minimize their exposure risk we may take further actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers contract manufacturers and suppliers 

operations 

we believe the covid19

pandemic and the numerous measures implemented by authorities in response has adversely impacted our results of operations including by increasing costs and decreasing demand in our industrial automation businesses but we cannot accurately estimate the amount of the impact to our 2020 financial results or to our future financial results in addition the pandemic has disrupted our contract manufacturers and suppliers and has resulted in some instances in shortterm cost increases to meet customer demand while the duration and severity of the pandemic may further impact our workforce and operations as well as those of our customers contract manufacturers and suppliers we expect that our manufacturing facilities will remain operational at sufficient capacity to support production demand we are monitoring our operations closely in an effort to avoid any potential productivity loss caused by responses to the covid19

pandemic 

supply 

we have not experienced any significant impacts or interruptions to our supply chain as a result of the covid19

pandemic however our suppliers have faced and may continue to face difficulties maintaining operations in light of governmentordered restrictions including social distancing requirements and shelterinplace

mandates our supply chain team and our suppliers overcame numerous supply production and logistics obstacles in 2020 but there is no assurance we or they will be able to do so in the future although we regularly monitor the financial health of companies in our supply chain financial hardship on our suppliers or subsuppliers

caused by the covid19

pandemic could disrupt our ability to obtain components required to manufacture our products adversely affecting our operations and in some instances result in higher costs and delays both for obtaining components and shipping finished goods to customers which could harm our profitability make our products less competitive or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers 

demand 

the covid19

pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty in our markets demand for our test products was strong throughout 2020 while there was incremental softening in the automotive sector in 2020 there was strengthening demand in mobility 5g and memory test our industrial automation business however experienced a significant decline in demand through first half of 2020 due to covid19

related shutdowns affecting global manufacturing but demand recovered in the second half of 2020 from the low point in the second quarter the covid19

pandemic could cause further global economic disruption that could cause demand for our products to decline which would adversely affect our business 

liquidity 

although there is continued uncertainty related to the impact of the covid19

pandemic on our future results we believe our business model and our current cash reserves leave us wellpositioned to manage our business through this crisis we have a strong balance sheet as well as an operating model that we believe is capable of flexing up and down with extreme demand swings while still remaining profitable based on our analysis we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and our currently anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months however due to the uncertainty related to the future impact of the covid19

pandemic 

 

in order to bolster our liquidity position on may 1 2020 we entered into a credit agreement providing for a threeyear senior secured revolving credit facility of 400 million as further described in note j “debt” as of february 22 2020 we have not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

we are continuing to monitor the evolving situation regarding the covid19

pandemic the availability of vaccinations where we do business and guidance from government authorities around the world in these circumstances there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan as a result given the uncertain nature of this situation we are not able to accurately predict the full extent of the impact of covid19

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

due to the covid19

pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and our markets we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of february 22 2021 the date of issuance of this annual report on form 10k

these estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue from contracts with customers 

in accordance with asc 606 “ revenue from contracts with customers” “asc 606”

 we recognize revenues when or as control is transferred to a customer our determination of revenue is dependent upon a five step process outlined below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

translation of nonus

currencies 

the functional currency for all nonus

subsidiaries is the us dollar except for universal robots mir and lemsys for which the local currency is its functional currency all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period all foreign currency denominated nonmonetary

assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other income expense net for universal robots mir and lemsys assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period revenues and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet 

retirement and postretirement plans 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

in march 2017 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201707

“compensation—retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and

net periodic postretirement benefit cost

” we retrospectively adopted the new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs in the first quarter of 2018 this guidance requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as other employee compensation costs the nonservice

components of net benefit costs such as interest cost expected return on assets amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains or losses are required to be reported separately outside of income or loss from operations following the adoption of this guidance we continue to record the service cost component in the same line item as other employee compensation costs and the nonservice

components of net benefit costs such as interest cost expected return on assets amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains or losses are reported within other income expense net 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost using a standard costing system which approximates cost based on a firstin

firstout

basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such 

 

writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 “ compensation—stock compensation

” upon adoption of asu 201609

“compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting”

in the first quarter of 2017 we made an accounting policy election to continue accounting for forfeitures by applying an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest in accordance with asu 201609

excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are recognized as a discrete tax benefit or discrete tax expense to the current income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations and are reported as cash flows from operating activities all cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf for withheld shares are presented as financing activities on the statement of cash flows in 2020 2019 and 2018 we recognized a discrete tax benefit of 96 million 49 million and 76 million respectively related to net excess tax benefit 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740 “ accounting for income taxes

” this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities estimates of projected future taxable income and taxplanning

strategies although realization is not assured based on our assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets net of the existing valuation allowance will be realized 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010

“ investments—debt and equity securities

” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment in other companies 

we account for investments in other companies at cost and evaluate for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis 

financial assets and financial liabilities 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601

“ financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510

recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities

” we adopted the new accounting 

 

guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach this guidance requires that changes in fair value of equity marketable securities be accounted for directly in earnings previously the changes in fair value of equity marketable securities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet we continue to record realized gains in interest income and realized losses in interest expense the adoption of this new accounting guidance increased the january 1 2018 retained earnings balance by 31 million and decreased the accumulated other comprehensive income balance by the same amount 

credit losses 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613

“financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” this standard introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement of credit losses on financial assets that are not measured at fair value through net income and replaces the “incurred loss” model with an “expected credit loss” model that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset we adopted this standard on january 1 2020 on a modified retrospective basis the adoption of asu 201613

did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations balance sheets cash flows or earnings per share 

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

on january 26 2017 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201704

“intangibles—goodwill and other topic

350 simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment”

the new guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation we adopted this standard on january 1 2020 on a prospective basis the adoption of asu 201704

did not have a material impact on the consolidated statement of operations cash flows or earnings per share we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired under asu 201704

goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill all other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary the same onestep

impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units even those with zero or negative carrying amounts entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts no goodwill impairment was identified in 2020 2019 and 2018 

we assess the impairment of intangible and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 

business combination 

we recognize the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed cash flows valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration at the time of the acquisition using all pertinent information known to us at the time to assess the probability of payment of contingent amounts or through the use of a monte carlo simulation model we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill the assumptions used in the valuations for our acquisitions may differ materially from actual results depending on performance of the acquired businesses and other factors while we believe the 

 

assumptions used were appropriate different assumptions in the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed could have a material impact on the timing and extent of impact on our statements of operations goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition 

results of operations 

information pertaining to fiscal year 2018 results of operations including a yeartoyear

comparison against fiscal year 2019 was included in our annual report on form 10k

for the year ended december 31 2019 under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations” which was filed with the sec on march 2 2020 this information is incorporated by reference herein 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total net revenues included in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

 

 

revenues 

revenues for our reportable segments were as follows 

 

 

the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 7070 million or 455 was driven primarily by an increase in semiconductor mobility test sales resulting from increased complexity of cell phone silicon which drives demand for testers and an increase in memory test sales of flash and dram testers the increase in system test revenues of 1222 million or 425 was primarily due to higher sales in storage test of system level and hard disk drive testers and higher sales in defenseaerospace test instrumentation and systems partially offset by lower sales in production board test due to lower automotive electronics demand the decrease in industrial automation revenues of 184 million or 62 was primarily due to lower demand for collaborative robotic arms in the automotive and manufacturing markets amplified by the impacts of covid19

the increase in wireless test revenues of 157 million or 100 was primarily due to increased sales of 5g wifi 6 and wifi 6e testers 

our reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues 

 

 

revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 1 

 

 

 

 

 

the breakout of product and service revenues was as follows 

 

 

our product revenues increased 8032 million or 425 primarily due to higher sales in semiconductor test mobility test segment higher sales of flash and dram testers higher sales in storage test of system level and hard disk drive testers and higher sales in wireless test of 5g wifi 6 and wifi 6e testers partially offset by a decrease in sales in industrial automation service revenues increased 233 million or 57 

in 2020 revenues from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd a customer of our semiconductor test segment accounted for 15 of our consolidated revenues in 2019 no single direct customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 and 2019 our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 36 and 27 of our consolidated revenues respectively 

we estimate consolidated revenues driven by one oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 25 and 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 and 2019 respectively we estimate consolidated revenues driven by huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 3 and 11 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

gross profit 

 

 

gross profit as a percent of total revenues decreased by 12 points primarily due to product mix in semiconductor test 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 

we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand

and onorder

inventory positions forecasted revenues information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future consolidated 

 

revenues this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test industrial automation and system test segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded an inventory provision of 175 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products of the 175 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 110 million was related to semiconductor test 48 million was related to wireless test 09 million was related to system test and 08 million was related to industrial automation 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded an inventory provision of 152 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products of the 152 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 87 million was related to semiconductor test 40 million was related to wireless test 20 million was related to system test and 05 million was related to industrial automation 

during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we scrapped 77 million and 92 million of inventory respectively and sold 23 million and 32 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff

inventory respectively as of december 31 2020 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff

totaling 1106 million we have no predetermined

timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 

the increase of 277 million in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 

the increase of 521 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation and higher spending across all segments 

restructuring and other 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded a 197 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the autoguide contingent consideration liability and a 35 million gain for the decrease in the fair 

 

value of the mir contingent consideration liability partially offset by a 40 million contract termination settlement charge 25 million of acquisition related compensation and expenses 23 million of severance charges primarily in industrial automation and 12 million of other expenses 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded a 222 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the mir contingent consideration liability partially offset by a 30 million gain for the increase in the fair value of the autoguide contingent consideration 29 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions primarily in semiconductor test and industrial automation and 25 million for acquisition related expenses and compensation 

the remaining accrual for severance of 05 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by march 2021 

interest and other 

 

 

interest income decreased by 110 million primarily due to lower interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019 interest expense increased by 20 million primarily due to interest expense related to our convertible senior notes and revolving credit facility costs other income expense net decreased by 135 million primarily due to a 150 million charge for the impairment of the investment in realwear in 2019 partially offset by a 21 million increase in pension actuarial losses from 82 million losses in 2019 to 103 million losses in 2020 

income loss before income taxes 

 

 

 

 

the increase in income before income taxes in semiconductor test was driven primarily by an increase in semiconductor mobility test sales resulting from increased complexity of cell phone silicon which drives demand for testers and an increase in memory test sales of flash and dram testers the increase in income before income taxes in system test was primarily due to higher sales in storage test of system level and hard disk drive testers and higher sales in defenseaerospace test of instrumentation and systems partially offset by lower sales in production board due to lower automotive electronics demand the increase in income before income taxes in wireless test was primarily due to increased sales of 5g wifi 6 and wifi 6e testers the decrease in income before income taxes in industrial automation was primarily due to lower demand for collaborative robotic arms in the automotive and manufacturing markets amplified by the impacts of covid19

 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2020 2019 and 2018 totaled 1169 million 583 million and 160 million respectively the effective tax rate for 2020 2019 and 2018 was 130 111 and 34 respectively 

the increase in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is primarily attributable to a reduction in the benefit from releases of reserves for uncertain tax positions and a reduction in the benefit from foreign tax credits these increases in expense were partially offset by a decrease in the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and shift in the geographic distribution of income which increases the income subject to taxation in lower tax rate jurisdictions relative to higher tax rate jurisdictions 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded 1860 million of additional income tax expense which represented our best estimate of the impact of the tax reform act in accordance with our understanding of the tax reform act and available guidance as of that date the 1860 million was primarily composed of expense of 1610 million related to the onetime

transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 336 million of expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and benefit of 103 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions in accordance with the requirements of sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 118 “income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act” in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our analysis of the effect of the tax reform act based on the application of the guidance available as of december 31 2018 and recorded 495 million of net income tax benefit the net benefit consisted of 517 million of benefit resulting from a reduction in the estimate of the onetime

transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and an expense of 22 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions 

the increase in the effective tax rate from 2018 to 2019 is primarily attributable to increases in expense associated with us global intangible lowtaxed

income and us transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings these increases in expense were partially offset by increased benefit from the us foreign derived intangible income deduction an increase in the benefit from foreign tax credits and the benefit from a net reduction in reserves for uncertain tax positions 

we qualify for a tax holiday in singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the singapore economic development board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were 299 million or 016 per diluted share 151 million or 008 per diluted share and 119 million or 006 per diluted share respectively in november 2020 we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2020 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2025

pandemic has not had an impact on our liquidity but there is no assurance that continued impacts resulting from the pandemic will not have an adverse effect in the future 

retirement plans 

asc 71520

“ compensation—retirement benefits—defined benefit plans

” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520

the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans’ assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

for the year ended december 31 2020 our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus

subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 139 million pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their forecast of asset class return expectations we believe that 30 was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2020 the december 31 2020 asset allocation for our us plan was 94 invested in fixed income securities 5 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the ftse pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 23 at december 31 2020 down from 31 at december 31 2019 we estimate that in 2021 we will recognize approximately 09 million of pension expense for the us plan the us plan pension expense estimate for 2021 is based on a 23 discount rate and a 24 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

as of december 31 2020 our pension plans had no unrecognized pension prior service cost 

the assets of the us plan consist substantially of fixed income securities us plan assets have decreased from 1669 million at december 31 2019 to 1589 million at december 31 2020 while the us plan’s 

 

liability decreased from 1485 million at december 31 2019 to 1414 million at december 31 2020 in 2020 the decrease in plan assets and plan liability was primarily due to a retiree annuity purchase in 2020 the accrued pension obligations for approximately 115 retiree participants were transferred to an insurance company and resulted in a 244 million reduction in the pension benefit obligation and pension assets we recorded 22 million of pension actuarial loss and a settlement loss of 05 million related to the retiree group annuity transaction 

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2020 we made contributions of 31 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 11 million to certain qualified plans for nonus

subsidiaries in 2021 we expect to contribute approximately 33 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan contributions to be made in 2021 to certain qualified plans for nonus

subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately 11 million 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note q “stockbased compensation”

in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21 2013 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 320 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 304 million shares issuable thereunder at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 12 2015 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to extend its term until may 12 2025 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2020 share numbers in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2020 was 6122630 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified

and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock 

as of december 31 2020 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested

restricted stock units and options was 44 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 years

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in august 2020 the fasb issued asu 202006—“debt—debt

with conversion and other options and derivatives and hedging—contracts in entity’s own equity” which simplifies the accounting for convertible 

 

debt instruments by reducing the number of accounting models and the number of embedded conversion features that could be recognized separately from the primary contract this asu requires a convertible debt instrument to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives this asu requires an entity to use the ifconverted

method in the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments this asu will be effective for teradyne on january 1 2022 with early adoption permitted beginning on january 1 2021 this asu permits the use of either the modified retrospective or fully retrospective method of transition teradyne is evaluating the timing and effects of the adoption of this asu on its financial statements

concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale

marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable as of december 31 2020 a customer of our semiconductor test segment ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for 25 of our accounts receivable balance the balance was paid in full as of february 22 2021 there were no customers who accounted for 10 or more of our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2019 

in addition to market risks we have an equity price risk related to the fair value of our convertible senior unsecured notes issued in december 2016 in december 2016 teradyne issued 460 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 as of december 31 2020 the notes had a fair value of 1740 million the table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10 changes of teradyne’s stock price as of the end of 2020 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the notes the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such event may have on the fair value of the notes the fair value of the notes is subject to equity price risk due to the convertible feature the fair value of the notes will generally increase as teradyne’s common stock price increases and will generally decrease as the common stock price declines in value the change in stock price affects the fair value of the convertible senior notes but does not impact teradyne’s financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation additionally we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only in connection with the offering of the notes we also sold warrants to the option counterparties these transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes the warrants along with any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the average market price of our common stock for a given reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price or conversion price of the warrants or notes respectively

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in japanese yen british pound korean won taiwan dollar singapore dollar euro philippine peso and chinese yuan these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily related to shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in the fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2020 and 2019

sales and distribution 

in 2019 and 2018 no single direct customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2017 revenues from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd accounted for 13 of our consolidated revenues taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd is a customer of our semiconductor test segment in each of the years 2019 2018 and 2017 our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 27 27 and 32 of our consolidated revenues respectively 

osat customers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd often purchase our test systems based upon recommendations from oems idms and fabless companies in all cases when an osat customer purchases a test system from us we consider the osat as the customer since credit risk title and risk of loss among other things are between teradyne and the osat we estimate consolidated revenues driven by huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 11 4 and 1 of our consolidated revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 

respectively we estimate consolidated revenues driven by another oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd accounted for approximately 10 13 and 22 of our consolidated revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the loss of or significant decrease in demand from huawei or this other oem customer or any of our five largest direct customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales and service offices located throughout north america central america asia and europe we sell in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force except for industrial automation products which are sold through distributors our manufacturing activities are primarily conducted through subcontractors and outsourced contract manufacturers with significant operations in china and malaysia 

sales to customers outside the united states were 85 87 and 88 respectively of our consolidated revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site 

see also “item 1a risk factors” and note t “operating segment geographic and significant customer information” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments competitors in the semiconductor test segment include among others advantest corporation and cohu inc 

competitors in the system test segment include among others keysight technologies inc advantest corporation test research inc and spea spa 

competitors in our industrial automation segment include manufacturers of traditional industrial robots such as kuka robotics corporation abb fanuc and yaskawa electric corporation companies with emerging collaborative robot offerings such as techman doosan and aubo robotics and manufacturers of autonomous mobile robots such as omron fetch otto motors vecna seegrid and balyo 

competitors in our wireless test segment include among others rohde  schwarz gmbh  co kg anritsu company keysight technologies inc and national instruments corporation 

some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian companies and from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2019 and 2018 our backlog of unfilled orders in our four reportable segments was as follows 

 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without advanced notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers some of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2019 we employed approximately 5400 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations

risk factors

tableend 

risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by global and industryspecific economic cycles which are difficult to predict and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient 

capital equipment providers in the electronics semiconductor industries and industrial automation such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries these cycles have resulted in periods of oversupply a trend we believe will continue to occur our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors electronics and other industrial products which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable increased risk of restructuring charges and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues which in each case and together adversely affect our operating results we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including implementing cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or marketspecific disruptions that might affect our test businesses and we may need to take additional or different measures in the future 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics that may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2019 2018 and 2017 our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 27 27 and 32 of consolidated revenues respectively 

we estimate consolidated revenues driven by huawei combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 11 4 and 1 of our consolidated revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we estimate consolidated revenues driven by another oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd accounted for approximately 10 13 and 22 of our consolidated revenues in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the 

loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions such as we experienced in our wireless test segment would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors could impact future operations 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and malaysia and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan china korea and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political health or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

the implementation of tariffs and export controls on our products may have a material impact on our business 

our business operations and supply chain are global and may be disrupted by the implementation of tariffs and export controls on our products 

in 2018 the united states trade representative imposed a 25 tariff on many products including certain teradyne products that are made in china and imported into the united states we have implemented operational changes that mitigate the impact of the 25 tariff on the import of our impacted products into the united states as a result we do not expect that the tariff will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

also in 2018 the united states department of commerce announced that it has commenced a review of new export controls focusing on emerging and foundational technologies while there is uncertainty as to the technologies that will be covered the new export controls could cover technologies used in one or more teradyne products and therefore could impact the sale of certain teradyne products and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to the actions taken by the united states china has implemented retaliatory tariffs on products made in the united states and imported into china including certain teradyne products we have implemented operational changes that mitigate the impact of the retaliatory tariffs however notwithstanding our efforts the retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions implemented by china could disrupt our business operations sales and supply chain and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

trade regulations and restrictions could impact our ability to sell products to and support certain customers which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are subject to us laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities compliance with these laws has not 

significantly limited our sales but could significantly limit them in the future changes in and responses to us trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the us government from time to time has issued export restrictions that prohibit us companies from exporting us manufactured products foreign manufactured products with more than 25 controlled us content as well as us origin technology for example the us department of commerce has restricted the access of us origin technologies to certain chinese companies by adding those companies to the entity list under us export administration regulations “ear” 

on may 16 2019 huawei and 68 of its affiliates including hisilicon were added to the us department of commerce entity list under the ear this action by the us department of commerce imposes new export licensing requirements on exports reexports

and incountry

transfers of all us regulated products software and technology to the designated huawei entities while most of our products are not subject to the ear and therefore not affected by the entity list restrictions certain of our products are currently manufactured in the us and thus subject to the entity list restrictions compliance with the entity list restrictions has not significantly impacted our sales in addition the prohibition on transfers of us origin technology to huawei could significantly limit our ability to service certain of our products sold to huawei and our ability to engage in product development activities with huawei and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore huawei’s inability to obtain products from other companies in its supply chain may adversely impact huawei’s demand for our products huawei or other foreign customers affected by future us government sanctions or threats of sanctions may respond by developing their own solutions to replace our products or by adopting our foreign competitors’ solutions also our controls related to entity list compliance could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities even if such restrictions are lifted any financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed on huawei could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the us department of commerce is seeking to modify the us ear to expand the scope of the regulations to include more products that would become subject to the entity list restrictions relating to huawei and the designated huawei entities including hisilicon these modified regulations if implemented as currently reported would impact our ability to continue to sell certain products directly to huawei and hisilicon both of which are significant teradyne customers however based on our understanding these proposed modified regulations would not impact our sales to third party contract manufacturers used by huawei and hisilicon to manufacture and test semiconductor and other electronic devices because the business environment for huawei is both fluid and uncertain there are also risks that huawei and hisilicon may have less demand for our products andor may purchase products from our competitors who are not impacted by the us regulations until these or any new regulations become public and effective we will not know the extent of the impact on our business with huawei and hisilicon however it is possible that these modified regulations and any other additional regulations that may be implemented by the us department of commerce or other government agency would have a material impact on our business and financial results 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

we may be subject to product recalls and warranty and product liability claims 

we invest significant resources in the design manufacture and testing of our products however we may discover design or manufacturing defects in our products after they have been shipped and as a result we may incur development and remediation costs and be required to settle warranty and product liability claims in addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or safety issues we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation which could make it more difficult to sell our products any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

our suppliers are subject to trade regulations including tariffs and export restrictions imposed by the united states government and by the governments of other countries these regulations could impact our suppliers’ ability to provide us with components for our products or could increase the price of those components 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform 

we depend on flex ltd “flex” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china plexus corp “plexus” to manufacture and test our magnum and ets family of products from 

its facility in malaysia and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer the flex facility in china may be impacted by the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and china by regulations implemented by the united states or china or disruption caused by health epidemics such as the coronavirus outbreak 

if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flex or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced certain general and administrative functions to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

in june 2015 we acquired universal robots in 2018 we acquired energid and mir and in 2019 we acquired lemsys and autoguide we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring or successfully growing these businesses we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime

charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash incurring debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in 

massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2019 we have not incurred material costs as a result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative regulatory or governmental proceedings including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results or cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the 

interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue authorities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could be adversely affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws tax regulations or an adverse tax ruling by administrative authorities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material change in our tax liability resulting from changes in tax laws tax regulations administrative ruling or from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue authority could negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome

based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in december 2015 we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2015 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 were 151 million or 008 per diluted share 119 million or 006 per diluted share and 248 million or 012 per diluted share respectively these tax savings may not be achievable in subsequent years due to changes in singapore’s tax laws or the expiration of the tax holiday

in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to maintain or obtain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note m “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program 

in january 2014 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to 007 per share in january 2017 to 009 per share in january 2018 and to 010 per share in january 2020 in january 2018 our board of directors approved a 15 billion share repurchase authorization in 2019 and 2018 we repurchased 500 million and 823 million of common stock respectively in january 2020 our board of directors approved a new 10 billion share repurchase authorization and cancelled the 2018 authorization we intend to repurchase a minimum of 250 million in 2020 holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the 

future the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness 

on december 12 2016 we completed a private offering of 4600 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 and received net proceeds after issuance costs of approximately 4508 million 330 million of which was used to pay the net cost after being partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the warrants of the convertible note hedge transactions and 501 million of which was used to repurchase 2 million shares of our common stock holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving us or the holders may elect to convert into shares of our common stock 

the issuance of the notes and any additional indebtedness among other things could 

 

 

 

 

on april 27 2015 we entered into a fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 3500 million which was terminated on june 27 2019 

our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the “note hedge transactions” with the initial purchasers or their affiliates the “option counterparties” the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the notes with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes of 3162 the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 145 million shares of our common stock 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties the “warrant transactions” in which we sold netsharesettled

or at our election subject to certain conditions cashsettled warrants to the option counterparties the warrant transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 145 million shares of our common stock the strike price of the warrants is 3968 per share the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants

the note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants the net cost of the note hedge transactions after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 330 million 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the option counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock 

andor purchase shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the option counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 

if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of our other obligations we would be in default under the terms thereof which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial position and operating results in addition we cannot be certain that we would be able to repay amounts due on the notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations or if the holders of the notes require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving us moreover we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

commencing in early february 2020 the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in disruption to our business operations in china including increased travel restrictions and the extended closing of certain of our offices at this time the disruption has not had a material adverse impact on our business if the spread of the virus continues and disruption in china or elsewhere worsens our business may be materially impacted 

a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we rely on various information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information including proprietary and confidential data and to carry out and support a variety of business 

activities including manufacturing research and development supply chain management sales and accounting we have experienced several attempted cyberattacks of our network none of the attempted attacks has caused a disruption to our operations or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial results as a result of the attempts we have taken further preventive security measures to protect our systems despite these preventative security measures we have implemented we may continue to be vulnerable to attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to our networks or sabotage our systems these attempts which might be related to criminal hackers industrial espionage or statesponsored intrusions include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers networks and systems and impersonating authorized users in addition third party suppliers and service providers that we rely on to manage our networks and systems and process and store our proprietary and confidential data may also be subject to similar attacks such attempts could result in the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of teradyne or our employees customers suppliers or other third parties as well as damage to or disruptions in our information technology networks and systems these threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures while we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems may be successful and in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our suppliers and other service providers including as a result of cyberattacks could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology networks and systems 

we may face risks associated with shareholder activism 

publicly traded companies are subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or divestitures we may become subject in the future to such shareholder activity and demands such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price 

provisions of our charter and bylaws

and massachusetts law may make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors wireless products data storage and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics wireless automotive industrial computing communications and aerospace and defense industries our industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include 

  

  

  

  

we have a customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers “osats” original equipment manufacturers “oems” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics manufacturers of circuit boards automotive suppliers wireless product manufacturers storage device manufacturers aerospace and military contractors and distributors that sell collaborative robots autonomous mobile robots and wireless test systems the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on these customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business because our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor electronics and industrial automation industries historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations 

the market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment a few customers drive significant demand for our test products both through direct sales and sales to the customers’ supply partners we expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future 

in 2019 revenue in our test businesses exceeded our plan as a result of semiconductor test demand in china early 5g test investments and strength in our system test businesses the revenue growth of our industrial automation businesses was below our plan in 2020 we expect continued strong momentum in our test businesses and improvement in the growth of our industrial automation businesses 

on february 26 2018 we acquired energid technologies corporation “energid” for a total purchase price of approximately 276 million energid’s technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets ranging from heavy industry to healthcare utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots energid is included in our industrial automation segment 

on april 25 2018 we acquired mobile industrial robots aps “mir” a danish limited liability company mir is a leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots “amrs” for industrial applications the total purchase price was approximately 1978 million which included cash paid of approximately 1452 million and 526 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes through 2020 contingent consideration for 2018 was 308 million and was paid in march 2019 contingent consideration for 2019 was 91 million and is expected to be paid in march 2020 the remaining maximum contingent consideration that could be paid is 632 million mir is included in our industrial automation segment 

based on our december 31 2019 goodwill impairment test the mir reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by 14 the mir goodwill amount is 1236 million as of december 31 2019 key assumptions in the goodwill valuation model are forecasted revenues discount rate and earnings before interest and taxes a change in any of these key assumptions could result in the reporting unit being impaired in a future period 

on january 30 2019 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of lemsys sa “lemsys” for a total purchase price of approximately 91 million lemsys strengthens our position in the electrification trends of vehicles solar wind and industrial applications lemsys is included in our semiconductor test segment 

on june 3 2019 we invested 150 million in realwear inc “realwear” realwear a private company develops and sells advanced wearable technology including industrial handsfree headmounted augmented reality devices that make the workplace safer and more productive on february 28 2020 realwear’s debt holder demanded repayment of its 250 million loan to realwear as a result in the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded an impairment charge of 150 million to reduce our investment in realwear to zero as of december 31 2019

on november 13 2019 we acquired 100 of the membership interests of autoguide llc “autoguide” a maker of high payload amrs an emerging and fast growing segment of the global forklift market the total purchase price was approximately 817 million which included cash paid of approximately 578 million and 240 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain performance targets extending potentially through 2022 the maximum contingent consideration that could be paid is 1069 million autoguide’s amrs are used for material transport of payloads up to 4500 kg in manufacturing warehouse and logistics applications these products complement mir’s lower payload products autoguide is included in our industrial automation segment which is a key component of our growth strategy 

we believe our recent acquisitions and investments have enhanced our opportunities for growth we intend to continue to invest in our business grow market share in our markets and further expand our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

revenue from contracts with customers 

in accordance with asc 606 “ revenue from contracts with customers” “asc 606”

 we recognize revenues when or as control is transferred to a customer our determination of revenue is dependent upon a five step process outlined below

  

  

  

  

  

translation of nonus

currencies 

the functional currency for all nonus

subsidiaries is the us dollar except for universal robots mir and lemsys for which the local currency is its functional currency all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period all foreign currency denominated nonmonetary

assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other income expense net for universal robots mir and lemsys assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period revenues and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet

retirement and postretirement plans 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate 

the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

in march 2017 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201707 

“compensation—retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost

” we retrospectively adopted the new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs in the first quarter of 2018 this guidance requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as other employee compensation costs the nonservice

components of net benefit costs such as interest cost expected return on assets amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains or losses are required to be reported separately outside of income or loss from operations following the adoption of this guidance we continue to record the service cost component in the same line item as other employee compensation costs and the nonservice

components of net benefit costs such as interest cost expected return on assets amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains or losses are reported within other income expense net in 2017 the retrospective adoption of this standard decreased income from operations by 50 million due to the reclass of net actuarial pension gains and increased nonoperating

income expense by the same amount with no impact to net income loss

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost using a standard costing system which approximates cost based on a firstin

firstout

basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 “ compensation—stock compensation

” upon adoption of asu 201609 

“compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting”

in the first quarter of 2017 we made an accounting policy election to continue accounting for forfeitures by applying an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest in accordance with asu 201609

starting in the first quarter of 2017 excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are recognized as a discrete tax benefit or discrete tax expense to the current income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations and are reported as cash flows from operating activities on january 1 2017 a cumulative effect adjustment of 391 million for any prior year excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies not previously recorded was recorded as an increase to retained earnings and deferred tax assets all cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf for withheld shares are presented as financing activities on the statement of cash flows in 2019 2018 and 2017 we recognized a discrete tax benefit of 49 million 76 million and 63 million respectively related to net excess tax benefit

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740 “ accounting for income taxes

” this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled

reversals of deferred tax liabilities estimates of projected future taxable income and taxplanning

strategies although realization is not assured based on our assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets net of the existing valuation allowance will be realized

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010

“ investments—debt and equity securities

” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include

  

  

  

investment in other companies 

we account for investments in other companies at cost and evaluate for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis 

financial assets and financial liabilities 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601

“ financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities

” we adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach this guidance requires that changes in fair value of equity marketable securities be accounted for directly in earnings previously the changes in fair value of equity marketable securities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet we continue to record realized gains in interest income and realized losses in interest expense the adoption of this new accounting guidance increased the january 1 2018 retained earnings balance by 31 million and decreased the accumulated other comprehensive income balance by the same amount

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

no goodwill impairment was identified in 2019 2018 and 2017 

based on our december 31 2019 goodwill impairment test the mir reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by 14 the mir goodwill amount is 1236 million as of december 31 2019 key assumptions in the goodwill valuation model are forecasted revenues discount rate and earnings before interest and taxes a change in any of these key assumptions could result in the reporting unit being impaired in a future period 

we assess the impairment of intangible and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 

business combination 

we recognize the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed cash flow valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration at the time of the acquisition using all pertinent information known to us at the time to assess the probability of payment of contingent amounts or through the use of a monte carlo simulation model we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill the assumptions used in the valuations for our acquisitions may differ materially from actual results depending on performance of the acquired businesses and other factors while we believe the assumptions used were appropriate different assumptions in the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed could have a material impact on the timing and extent of impact on our statements of operations goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition 

results of operations 

information pertaining to fiscal year 2017 results of operations including a yeartoyear

comparison against fiscal year 2018 was included in our annual report on form 10k

for the year ended december 31 2018 under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations” which was filed with the sec on march 1 2019 this information is incorporated by reference herein

the following table sets forth the percentage of total net revenues included in our consolidated statements of operations 

  

revenues 

revenues for our reportable segments were as follows 

  

the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 602 million or 4 from 2018 to 2019 was driven primarily by an increase in semiconductor tester sales for 5g infrastructure and image sensors and higher service revenue partially offset by a decrease in sales in the automotive and analog test segments 

the increase in industrial automation revenues of 366 million or 14 from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to higher demand for collaborative robots the mir acquisition was completed in april 2018 

the increase in system test revenues of 714 million or 33 from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to higher sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers higher sales in defenseaerospace test instrumentation and systems and higher sales in production board test from higher 5g demand 

the increase in wireless test revenues of 253 million or 19 from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products driven by new wireless standards and 5g partially offset by lower sales in connectivity test products and services 

our reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues 

  

revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 1 

  

 

  

 

the breakout of product and service revenues was as follows 

  

 

our product revenues increased 1581 million or 9 in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to higher sales in semiconductor test of testers for 5g infrastructure and image sensors higher sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers and higher demand in industrial automation partially offset by a decrease in sales in semiconductor test automotive and analog test segments service revenues increased 361 million or 10 

in 2019 and 2018 no single direct customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2019 and 2018 our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 27 and 27 of our consolidated revenues respectively 

we estimate consolidated revenues driven by huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 11 and 4 of our consolidated revenues in 2019 and 2018 respectively we estimate consolidated revenues driven by another oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 10 and 13 of our consolidated revenues in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

gross profit 

  

 

gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased from 2018 to 2019 by 03 points primarily due to favorable product mix in semiconductor test and storage test 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

  

 

we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand

obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future consolidated revenues this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test industrial automation and system test segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded an inventory provision of 152 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products of the 152 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 87 million was related to semiconductor test 40 million was related to wireless test 20 million was related to system test and 05 million was related to industrial automation 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded an inventory provision of 112 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products of the 112 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 68 million was related to semiconductor test 25 million was related to wireless test 12 million was related to system test and 07 million was related to industrial automation 

during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we scrapped 92 million and 70 million of inventory respectively and sold 32 million and 67 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff 

inventory respectively as of december 31 2019 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff

totaling 1036 million we have no predetermined

timeline to scrap the remaining inventory

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

  

 

the increase of 464 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to higher spending in industrial automation from higher sales and marketing spending in universal robots and mir which was acquired on april 25 2018 higher sales and marketing spending in semiconductor test and higher variable compensation 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

  

 

the increase of 213 million in engineering and development expenses from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to higher spending in industrial automation and wireless test and higher variable compensation 

restructuring and other 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded a gain of 222 million from the decrease in the fair value of the mir contingent consideration liability partially offset by a 30 million increase in the fair value of the autoguide contingent consideration 29 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions primarily in semiconductor test and industrial automation and 25 million for acquisition related expenses and compensation 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded an expense of 177 million for the increase in the fair value of the mir contingent consideration liability 87 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions primarily in semiconductor test and 45 million for acquisition related expenses and compensation partially offset by a gain of 167 million from the decrease in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability 

the remaining accrual for severance of 05 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by october 2020 

interest and other 

  

interest income decreased by 19 million from 2018 to 2019 due primarily to lower cash and marketable securities balances in 2019 interest expense decreased by 82 million from 2018 to 2019 due primarily to unrealized losses on equity marketable securities recognized in 2018 other income expense net increased by 281 million from 2018 to 2019 due primarily to a 150 million charge for the impairment of the investment in realwear and an 115 million change in pension actuarial gains losses from a 33 million gain in 2018 to an 82 million loss in 2019 

income loss before income taxes 

  

 

  

the increase in income before income taxes in semiconductor test from 2018 to 2019 was driven primarily by an increase in semiconductor tester sales for 5g infrastructure and image sensors partially offset by a decrease in sales in the automotive and analog test segments the increase in income before income taxes in system test from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to higher sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers higher sales in defenseaerospace test instrumentation and systems and higher sales in production board test 

from higher 5g demand the increase in income before income taxes in wireless test from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products driven by new wireless standards and 5g partially offset by lower sales in connectivity test products and services the decrease in income before income taxes in industrial automation from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to higher sales and marketing and engineering spending 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2019 2018 and 2017 totaled 583 million 160 million and 2667 million respectively the effective tax rate for 2019 2018 and 2017 was 111 34 and 509 respectively 

the increase in the effective tax rate from 2018 to 2019 is primarily attributable to increases in expense associated with us global intangible lowtaxed

income and us transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings these increases in expense were partially offset by increased benefit from the us foreign derived intangible income deduction foreign tax credits and a net reduction in reserves for uncertain tax positions

we recorded 1860 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 which represented our best estimate of the impact of the tax reform act in accordance with our understanding of the tax reform act and available guidance as of that date the 1860 million was primarily composed of expense of 1610 million related to the onetime

transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 336 million of expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and benefit of 103 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions in accordance with the requirements of sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 118 “income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act” in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our analysis of the effect of the tax reform act based on the application of the guidance available as of december 31 2018 and recorded 495 million of net income tax benefit the net benefit consisted of 517 million of benefit resulting from a reduction in the estimate of the onetime

transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and an expense of 22 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions

the change in the effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 was also impacted by a shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased income subject to taxation in the us relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions the benefit of the us foreign derived intangible income deduction and increases in discrete benefit from nontaxable

foreign exchange gains and losses

we qualify for a tax holiday in singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the singapore economic development board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 were 151 million or 008 per diluted share 119 million or 006 per diluted share and 248 million or 012 per diluted share respectively the tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020

retirement plans 

asc 71520

“ compensation—retirement benefits—defined benefit plans

” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520

the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31

for the year ended december 31 2019 our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus

subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 116 million pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their forecast of asset class return expectations we believe that 425 was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2019 the december 31 2019 asset allocation for our us plan was 94 invested in fixed income securities 5 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the ftse pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 310 at december 31 2019 down from 415 at december 31 2018 we estimate that in 2020 we will recognize approximately 09 million of pension expense for the us plan the us plan pension expense estimate for 2020 is based on a 31 discount rate and a 30 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

as of december 31 2019 our pension plans had no unrecognized pension prior service cost 

the assets of the us plan consist substantially of fixed income securities us plan assets have increased from 1443 million at december 31 2018 to 1669 million at december 31 2019 while the us plan’s liability increased from 1274 million at december 31 2018 to 1485 million at december 31 2019 in 2019 the increase in plan assets and plan liability was due to a decrease in interest rates in 2018 the accrued pension obligations for approximately 1700 retiree participants were transferred to an insurance company and resulted in a 1513 million reduction in the pension benefit obligation and pension assets we recorded a settlement loss of 03 million related to the retiree group annuity transaction 

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2019 we made contributions of 28 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 09 million to certain qualified plans for nonus 

subsidiaries in 2020 we expect to contribute approximately 28 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan contributions to be made in 2020 to certain qualified plans for nonus 

subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately 10 million

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note q “stockbased compensation”

in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21 2013 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 320 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 304 million shares issuable thereunder at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 12 2015 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to extend its term until may 12 2025 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2019 share numbers in thousands 

  

 

  

  

  

  

the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2019 was 6719918 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified

and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock

as of december 31 2019 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested

restricted stock units and options was 45 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 18 years

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

on january 26 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 

“intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment”

the new guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation goodwill impairment will be the

amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill all other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary the same onestep

impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units even those with zero or negative carrying amounts entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts the revised guidance will be applied prospectively and is effective in 2020 early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after january 1 2017 this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and statements of cash flows

concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale

marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable there were no customers who accounted for 10 or more of our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2019 or december 31 2018

in addition to market risks we have an equity price risk related to the fair value of our convertible senior unsecured notes issued in december 2016 in december 2016 teradyne issued 460 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 as of december 31 2019 the notes had a fair value of 1010 million the table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10 changes of teradyne’s stock price as of the end of 2019 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the notes the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such event may have on the fair value of the notes the fair value of the notes is subject to equity price risk due to the convertible feature the fair value of the notes will generally increase as teradyne’s common stock price increases and will generally decrease as the common stock price declines in value the change in stock price affects the fair value of the convertible senior notes but does not impact teradyne’s financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation additionally we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only in connection with the offering of the notes we also sold warrants to the option counterparties these transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes the warrants along with any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the average market price of our common stock for a given reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price or conversion price of the warrants or notes respectively 

  

see note j “debt” for further information 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in japanese yen british pound korean won taiwan dollar singapore dollar euro philippine peso and chinese yuan these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily related to shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in the fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2019 and 2018

 item 1 business 

tableend teradyne inc “teradyne” was founded in 1960 and is a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications 

we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors wireless products data storage and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics wireless automotive industrial computing communications and aerospace and defense industries our industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include 

 

  

  

  

 we have a customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers “osats” original equipment manufacturers “oems” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics manufacturers of circuit boards automotive suppliers wireless product manufacturers storage device manufacturers aerospace and military contractors and distributors that sell collaborative robots autonomous mobile robots and wireless test systems 

the market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment one customer drives significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customer’s supply partners we expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future 

  

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business because our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations during the first quarter of 2018 demand outlook for mobile device test capacity in 2018 declined sharply for our semiconductor test business demand in other segments of the semiconductor test business including memory test increased in 2018 

in 2015 we acquired universal robots as “universal robots” the leading supplier of collaborative robots which are lowcost easytodeploy and simpletoprogram robots that work side by side with production workers to improve quality increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs the acquisition of universal robots provides a growth engine to our business the total purchase price for universal robots was approximately 315 million which included cash paid of approximately 284 million and 32 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and earnings targets through 2018 contingent consideration for 2015 was 15 million and was paid in february 2016 contingent consideration for the period from july 2015 to december 2017 was 246 million and was paid in march 2018 contingent consideration for the period from july 2015 to december 2018 was 39 million and is expected to be paid in march 2019

sales and distribution 

in 2018 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2017 and 2016 revenues from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd accounted for 13 and 12 respectively of our consolidated revenues in 2016 revenues from ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for 12 of our consolidated revenues taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and ja mitsui leasing ltd are customers of our semiconductor test segment in each of the years 2018 2017 and 2016 our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 27 32 and 36 of our consolidated revenues respectively 

osat customers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd often purchase our test systems based upon recommendations from oems idms and fabless companies in all cases when an osat customer purchases a test system from us we consider the osat as the customer since credit risk title and risk of loss among other things are between teradyne and the osat we estimate consolidated revenues driven by a single oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and its leasing company ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for approximately 13 22 and 26 of our consolidated revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the loss of or significant decrease in demand from this oem customer or any of our five largest direct customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales and service offices located throughout north america asia and europe we sell in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force except for industrial automation products which are sold through distributors our manufacturing activities are primarily conducted through subcontractors and outsourced contract manufacturers with significant operations in china and malaysia 

sales to customers outside the united states were 87 88 and 87 respectively of our consolidated revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site

backlog 

at december 31 2018 and 2017 our backlog of unfilled orders in our four reportable segments was as follows 

 

  

 of the backlog at december 31 2018 approximately 98 of the semiconductor test backlog 89 of the system test backlog and 35 of the industrial automation backlog is expected to be delivered in 2019 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without advanced notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers some of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2018 we employed approximately 4900 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by global and industryspecific economic cycles which are difficult to predict and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality 

  

within those industries these cycles have resulted in periods of oversupply a trend we believe will continue to occur for newer generations of electronic products our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable increased risk of restructuring charges and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues which in each case and together adversely affect our operating results we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including implementing cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or marketspecific disruptions that might affect our test businesses and we may need to take additional or different measures in the future 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics that may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2018 2017 and 2016 our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 27 32 and 36 of consolidated revenues respectively we estimate consolidated revenues driven by a single oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and its leasing company ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for approximately 13 22 and 26 of our consolidated revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions such as we experienced in our wireless test segment would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors could impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and malaysia and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan china singapore and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

the implementation of tariffs and export controls on our products may have a material impact on our business 

our business operations and supply chain are global and may be disrupted by the implementation of tariffs and export controls on our products 

on july 6 2018 and august 23 2018 the united states trade representative imposed a 25 tariff on two lists of products including certain teradyne products that are made in china and imported into the united states we have submitted requests for exclusion of our products from the tariff but there is no assurance that our requests will be approved we have implemented operational changes that will mitigate the impact of the 25 tariff on the import of our impacted products into the united states as a result we do not expect that the tariff will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

on september 24 2018 the united states trade representative imposed a 10 tariff on many additional products made in china and imported into the united states the tariff rate may increase to 25 in 2019 at this time we do not expect that this tariff will significantly impact any teradyne products and thus the tariff should not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

on june 29 2018 the united states department of commerce announced that it has commenced a review of new export controls focusing on emerging and foundational technologies while there is uncertainty as to the technologies that will be covered the new export controls could cover technologies used in one or more teradyne products and therefore could impact the sale of certain teradyne products and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the united states department of commerce from time to time has taken action to restrict the access of usorigin technologies to chinese companies by adding them to the entity list under us export administration regulations the addition to the entity list of chinese companies who are customers or potential customers could impact the sale andor support of certain teradyne products to those customers or potential customers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to the actions taken by the united states china has implemented retaliatory tariffs on products made in the united states and imported into china including certain teradyne products we plan to assess and implement if appropriate operational changes that would mitigate the impact of the retaliatory tariffs however notwithstanding our efforts the retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions implemented by china could disrupt our business operations sales and supply chain and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer 

  

demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may be subject to product recalls and warranty and product liability claims 

we invest significant resources in the design manufacture and testing of our products however we may discover design or manufacturing defects in our products after they have been shipped and as a result we may incur development and remediation costs and be required to settle warranty and product liability claims in addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or safety issues we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation which could make it more difficult to sell our products any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform 

we depend on flex ltd “flex” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flex or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced certain general and administrative functions to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

in june 2015 we acquired universal robots and in 2018 we acquired energid and mir we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring or successfully growing these businesses we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash incurring debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

   

pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2018 we have not incurred material costs as a result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative regulatory or governmental proceedings including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results or cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

  

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could be adversely affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws tax regulations or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material change in our tax liability resulting from changes in tax laws tax regulations administrative ruling or from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in december 2015 we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2015 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 were 119 million or 006 per diluted share 248 million or 012 per diluted share and 170 million or 008 per diluted share respectively these tax savings may not be achievable in subsequent years due to changes in singapore’s tax laws or the expiration of the tax holiday 

in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to maintain or obtain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note k “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program 

in january 2014 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share in january 2017 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to 007 per share and in january 2018 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to 009 per share in january 2018 our board of directors approved a new 15 billion share repurchase authorization in 2018 and 2017 we repurchased 823 million and 200 million of common stock respectively we intend to repurchase 500 million in 2019 holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors 

  

and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness 

on december 12 2016 we completed a private offering of 4600 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 and received net proceeds after issuance costs of approximately 4508 million 330 million of which was used to pay the net cost after being partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the warrants of the convertible note hedge transactions and 501 million of which was used to repurchase 2 million shares of our common stock holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving us or the holders may elect to convert into shares of our common stock 

on april 27 2015 we entered into a fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 3500 million subject to customary conditions we may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders incremental commitments under the credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 1500 million we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility we could borrow funds under this credit facility at any time for general corporate purposes and working capital 

the issuance of the notes and any additional indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

  

 our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the “note hedge transactions” with the initial purchasers or their affiliates the “option counterparties” the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the notes with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes of 3170 the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 145 million shares of our common stock 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties the “warrant transactions” in which we sold netsharesettled or at our election subject to certain conditions cashsettled warrants to the option counterparties the warrant transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 145 million shares of our common stock the strike price of the warrants is 3978 per share the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants 

  

the note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants the net cost of the note hedge transactions after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 330 million 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the option counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor purchase shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the option counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 

if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of our other obligations we would be in default under the terms thereof which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial position and operating results in addition we cannot be certain that we would be able to repay amounts due on the notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations or if the holders of the notes require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving us moreover we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 

restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies 

the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability among other things to incur additional secured indebtedness sell transfer license or dispose of assets consolidate or merge enter into transactions with our affiliates and incur liens in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest such as subject to permitted exceptions making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds making investments loans and other advances and prepaying any additional indebtedness while our indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility is outstanding our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we rely on various information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including confidential data and to carry out and support a variety of business activities including manufacturing research and development supply chain management sales and accounting a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our suppliers and other service providers including as a result of cyber attacks could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs 

we may face risks associated with shareholder activism 

publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or divestitures we may become subject in the future to such shareholder activity and demands such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price 

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law may make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors wireless products data storage and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics wireless automotive industrial computing communications and aerospace and defense industries our industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include 

 

  

  

  

 we have a customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers “osats” original equipment manufacturers “oems” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics manufacturers of circuit boards automotive suppliers wireless product manufacturers storage device manufacturers aerospace and military contractors and distributors that sell collaborative robots autonomous mobile robots and wireless test systems 

the market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment one customer drives significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customer’s supply partners we expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business because our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations during the first quarter of 2018 demand outlook for mobile device test capacity in 2018 declined sharply for our semiconductor test business demand in other segments of the semiconductor test business including memory test increased in 2018 

  

in 2015 we acquired universal robots as “universal robots” the leading supplier of collaborative robots which are lowcost easytodeploy and simpletoprogram robots that work side by side with production workers to improve quality increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs the acquisition of universal robots provides a growth engine to our business the total purchase price for universal robots was approximately 315 million which included cash paid of approximately 284 million and 32 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and earnings targets through 2018 contingent consideration for 2015 was 15 million and was paid in february 2016 contingent consideration for the period from july 2015 to december 2017 was 246 million and was paid march 2018 contingent consideration for the period from july 2015 to december 2018 was 39 million and it is expected to be paid in march 2019 

on february 26 2018 we acquired energid technologies corporation “energid” for a total purchase price of approximately 276 million energid’s technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets ranging from heavy industry to healthcare utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots 

on april 25 2018 we acquired mobile industrial robots aps “mir” a danish limited liability company mir is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications the total purchase price was approximately 198 million which included cash paid of approximately 145 million and 53 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes through 2020 at december 31 2018 the maximum amount of contingent consideration that could be paid is 115 million contingent consideration for 2018 was 310 million and is expected to be paid in march 2019 

universal robots mir and energid are included in our industrial automation segment 

we believe our recent acquisitions have enhanced our opportunities for growth we intend to continue to invest in our business grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

revenue from contracts with customers 

we adopted accounting standards codification “asc” 606 “ revenue from contracts with customers” on january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption the reported results for 2018 reflect the application of asc 606 while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of asc 605 “revenue recognition” which is also referred to herein as “legacy gaap” or the “previous guidance” we recorded a net increase to retained earnings of 127 million as of january 1 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting asc 606 the adoption of asc 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of teradyne’s hardware and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures in accordance with asc 606 revenue is recognized when or as a customer obtains control of promised goods or services the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which teradyne expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for fulfillment of the performance obligation teradyne’s primary source of revenue will continue to be from the sale of systems instruments robots and the delivery of services 

  

in accordance with asc 606 we recognize revenues when or as control is transferred to a customer our determination of revenue is dependent upon a five step process outlined below 

step 1 identify the contract with the customer 

we account for a contract with a customer when there is written approval the contract is committed the rights of the parties including payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection 

step 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 

we periodically enter into contracts with customers in which a customer may purchase a combination of goods and services such as products with extended warranty obligations we determine performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from the other elements of the contract in order to be distinct the product or service must perform either on its own or with readily available resources and must be separate within the context of the contract 

step 3 determine the transaction price 

we consider the amount stated on the face of the purchase order to be the transaction price we do not have variable consideration which could impact the stated purchase price agreed to by us and the customer 

step 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

transaction price is allocated to each individual performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of that performance obligation we use standalone transactions when available to value each performance obligation if standalone transactions are not available we will estimate the standalone selling price through market assessments or cost plus a reasonable margin analysis any discounts from standalone selling price are spread proportionally to each performance obligation 

step 5 recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation 

in order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition we first determine if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition if the transaction meets the criteria for over time recognition we recognize revenue as the good or service is delivered we use input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period input variables are used as they best align consumption with benefit to the customer for transactions that do not meet the criteria for over time recognition we will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control we have concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms typically acceptance of our products and services is a formality as we deliver similar systems instruments and robots to standard specifications in cases where acceptance is not deemed a formality we will defer revenue recognition until customer acceptance 

translation of nonus currencies 

the functional currency for all nonus subsidiaries is the us dollar except for the industrial automation segment for which the local currency is its functional currency all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period all foreign currency denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other income expense net for industrial automation assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period revenues and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

  

retirement and postretirement plans 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

in march 2017 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201707 “compensation—retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost ” we retrospectively adopted the new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs in the first quarter of 2018 this guidance requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as other employee compensation costs the nonservice components of net benefit costs such as interest cost expected return on assets amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains or losses are required to be reported separately outside of income or loss from operations following the adoption of this guidance we continue to record the service cost component in the same line item as other employee compensation costs and the nonservice components of net benefit costs such as interest cost expected return on assets amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains or losses are reported within other income expense net in 2017 and 2016 the retrospective adoption of this standard decreased income from operations by 50 million and 30 million respectively due to the reclass of net actuarial pension gains and increased nonoperating income expense by the same amount with no impact to net income loss 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 “ compensation—stock compensation ” upon adoption of asu 201609 “compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” in the first quarter of 2017 we made an accounting policy election to continue accounting for forfeitures by applying an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest in accordance with asu 201609 starting in the first quarter of 2017 excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are recognized as a discrete tax benefit or discrete tax expense to the current income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations and are reported as cash flows from operating activities on january 1 2017 a cumulative effect adjustment of 391 million for any prior year excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies not previously recorded was recorded as an increase to retained earnings and deferred tax assets all cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf for withheld shares are presented as financing activities on the statement of cash flows in 2018 and 2017 we recognized a discrete tax benefit of 76 million and 63 million respectively related to net excess tax benefit 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance 

  

if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740 “ accounting for income taxes ” this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities estimates of projected future taxable income and taxplanning strategies although realization is not assured based on our assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets net of the existing valuation allowance will be realized 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities ” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

 financial assets and financial liabilities 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 “ financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities ” we adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach this guidance requires that changes in fair value of equity marketable securities be accounted for directly in earnings previously the changes in fair value of equity marketable securities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet we continue to record realized gains in interest income and realized losses in interest expense the adoption of this new accounting guidance increased the january 1 2018 retained earnings balance by 31 million and decreased the accumulated other comprehensive income balance by the same amount 

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

in the second quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment reduced headcount by 11 as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer who had previously contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test following the interim goodwill impairment test we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2549 million with approximately 80 million of goodwill remaining 

no goodwill impairment was identified in the fourth quarter of 2018 2017 and 2016 as part of the annual goodwill impairment test 

  

we assess the impairment of intangible and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 

as a result of the interim goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2016 described above we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segment’s intangible and longlived assets based on the comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets and recorded an 833 million acquired intangible assets impairment charge with approximately 22 million of intangible assets remaining at december 31 2018 there were no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of acquired intangible and longlived assets may not be recoverable in 2018 and 2017 as such no impairment test was performed when we determine that the carrying value of intangible and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total net revenues included in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

   

revenues 

revenues for our reportable segments were as follows 

 

 the decrease in semiconductor test revenues of 1701 million or 10 from 2017 to 2018 was driven primarily by a decrease in sales in the mobility and microcontroller test segments partially offset by increased sales in memory and analog test segments and an increase in service revenues the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 2943 million or 22 from 2016 to 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales in the microcontroller power management flash memory and automotive safety test segments and an increase in service revenues 

the increase in industrial automation revenues of 914 million or 54 from 2017 to 2018 was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of mir completed in april 2018 mir added revenues of 241 million in 2018 the increase in industrial automation revenues of 711 million or 72 from 2016 to 2017 was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms 

the increase in system test revenues of 240 million or 12 from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to higher system sales in production board test and higher sales of 35” hard disk drive and system level testers in storage test the increase in system test revenues of 23 million or 1 from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to higher service revenue in defenseaerospace test instrumentation and systems 

the increase in wireless test revenues of 201 million or 18 from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to higher demand for next generation wireless products the increase in wireless test revenues of 157 million or 16 from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to higher demand for connectivity test systems and higher service revenue 

our reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues 

 

   

revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 1 

 

  

 the breakout of product and service revenues was as follows 

 

 our product revenues decreased 551 million or 3 in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to lower sales in semiconductor test mobility test segment partially offset by higher sales in industrial automation system test and wireless test service revenues increased 193 million or 5 

our product revenues increased 3315 million or 23 in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher sales across all semiconductor test products and higher sales in industrial automation service revenues which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and include equipment maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 519 million or 17 

in 2018 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2017 and 2016 revenues from one customer accounted for 13 and 12 respectively of our consolidated revenues in 2016 a different customer accounted for 12 of our consolidated revenues in each of the years 2018 2017 and 2016 our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 27 32 and 36 respectively of our consolidated revenues we estimate consolidated revenues driven by a single oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 13 22 and 26 of our consolidated revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

gross profit 

 

   

gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased from 2017 to 2018 by 09 points primarily due to favorable product mix in system test semiconductor test and lower product costs in industrial automation 

gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased from 2016 to 2017 by 25 points as a result of a 15 point increase related to favorable product mix in semiconductor test and a 10 point increase due to higher sales primarily in semiconductor test and industrial automation 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenues information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future consolidated revenues this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test industrial automation and system test segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded an inventory provision of 112 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products of the 112 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 68 million was related to semiconductor test 25 million was related to wireless test 12 million was related to system test and 07 million was related to industrial automation 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded an inventory provision of 88 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products of the 88 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 46 million was related to semiconductor test 22 million was related to wireless test and 19 million was related to system test 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded an inventory provision of 175 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of the 175 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 97 million was related to semiconductor test 72 million was related to wireless test and 06 million was related to system test 

during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we scrapped 70 million 144 million and 152 million of inventory respectively and sold 67 million 75 million and 100 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2018 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1008 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

  

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 418 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2017 to 2018 was due primarily to higher spending in industrial automation related to higher sales and marketing spending in universal robots and due to the acquisitions of mir and energid in 2018 partially offset by lower variable compensation across all segments 

the increase of 324 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to higher variable compensation across all segments and higher spending in universal robots partially offset by lower spending in wireless test 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 the decrease of 58 million in engineering and development expenses from 2017 to 2018 was due primarily to lower spending in system test and semiconductor test and lower variable compensation partially offset by higher spending in industrial automation 

the increase of 151 million in engineering and development expenses from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to higher variable compensation across all segments and higher spending in system test and industrial automation partially offset by lower spending in wireless test and semiconductor test 

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to industrial automation segment acquisitions of mir and energid in 2018 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2016 to 2017 primarily in the wireless test segment due to the impairment of acquired intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016 and in the industrial automation segment due to intangible assets that became fully amortized in june 2017 

  

goodwill impairment 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in the second quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment reduced headcount by 11 as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer which had contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test following the interim goodwill impairment test we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2549 million in the second quarter of 2016 the fourth quarter 2018 2017 and 2016 goodwill impairment tests did not identify any goodwill impairments 

acquired intangible assets impairment 

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate if undiscounted cash flows for the asset are less than the carrying amount the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment contain management’s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segment’s intangible and longlived assets based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets as a result of the analysis we recorded an 833 million impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 in acquired intangible assets impairment on the statements of operations 

restructuring and other 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded an expense of 177 million for the increase in the fair value of the mir contingent consideration liability 87 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions primarily in semiconductor test and 45 million for acquisition related expenses and compensation partially offset by a gain of 167 million from the decrease in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded an expense of 78 million for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability 38 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions primarily in semiconductor test 11 million for an impairment of fixed assets in semiconductor test 10 million for a lease impairment of a wireless test facility in sunnyvale ca which was terminated in september 2017 and 08 million of expenses related to an earthquake in kumamoto japan partially offset by 51 million of property insurance recovery related to the japan earthquake 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded an expense of 159 million for the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability of which 153 million was related to universal robots and 06 million was related to avionics interface technologies llc “ait” 60 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions primarily in wireless test 42 million for an impairment of fixed assets and 09 million for expenses related to an earthquake in kumamoto japan partially offset by 51 million of property insurance recovery related to the japan earthquake 

  

the remaining accrual for severance of 10 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by april 2019 

interest and other 

 

 interest income increased by 89 million from 2017 to 2018 due primarily to higher interest rates and realized gains on sales of marketable securities interest income increased by 85 million from 2016 to 2017 due primarily to higher cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates 

interest expense increased by 96 million from 2017 to 2018 due primarily to recognizing unrealized losses on equity marketable securities and by 181 million from 2016 to 2017 due primarily to interest expense related to our convertible senior notes 

other income expense net changed by 43 million from 29 million income in 2017 to 14 million expense in 2018 due primarily to lower pension actuarial gains in 2018 and higher foreign exchange losses partially offset by lower non service pension costs other income expense net decreased by 06 million from 2016 to 2017 due primarily to pension actuarial gains 

income loss before income taxes 

 

  

 the decrease in income before income taxes in semiconductor test from 2017 to 2018 was driven primarily by a decrease in sales in the mobility and microcontroller test segments partially offset by an increase in memory and analog test segments sales and an increase in service revenues the increase in income before income taxes in system test from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to higher system sales in production board test and higher sales of 35” hard disk drive and system level testers in storage test the increase in income before income taxes in wireless test from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to higher demand for next generation wireless products the decrease in income before income taxes in industrial automation from 2017 to 2018 was due primarily to increased intangible assets amortization expense from the acquisitions of mir and energid in 2018 

  

the increase in income before income taxes in semiconductor test from 2016 to 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales and higher gross margin due to favorable product mix the increase in income before income taxes in wireless test from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in 2016 lower intangible assets amortization lower operating expenses higher demand for connectivity test systems and higher service revenue in 2017 the decrease in income before income taxes in system test from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to lower sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers for cloud storage and increased spending for new product development the increase in income before income taxes in industrial automation was due primarily to higher demand for collaborative robots 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2018 and 2017 totaled 160 and 2667 million respectively income tax benefit for 2016 totaled 116 million the effective tax rate for 2018 2017 and 2016 was 34 509 and 211 respectively 

the increase in the effective tax rate from 2016 to 2017 and the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 are primarily attributable to the effect of changes in us federal tax law on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax reform act” making significant changes to the internal revenue code among other changes the tax reform act permanently reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 shifts the us tax regime from a worldwide system to a modified territorial tax system and requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred 

we recorded a provisional amount of 1860 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 which represented our best estimate of the impact of the tax reform act in accordance with our understanding of the tax reform act and available guidance as of that date the 1860 million is primarily composed of expense of 1610 million related to the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 336 million of expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and benefit of 103 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions in accordance with the requirements of sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 118 “income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act” in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our analysis of the effect of the tax reform act based on the application of the most recently available guidance as of december 31 2018 and recorded 495 million of net income tax benefit the net benefit consisted of 517 million of benefit resulting from a reduction in the estimate of the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and an expense of 22 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions 

the change in the effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 was also impacted by a shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased income subject to taxation in the us relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions the benefit of the us foreign derived intangible income deduction and increases in discrete benefit from nontaxable foreign exchange gains and losses 

the change in the effective rate from 2016 to 2017 was also impacted by the us nondeductible goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016 a shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased income subject to taxation in the us relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions decreases in the discrete benefits from tax reserve releases increases in discrete expense from nontaxable foreign exchange gains and losses and an increase in the discrete benefit from stockbased compensation 

we qualify for a tax holiday in singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the singapore economic development board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 were 119 million or 006 per diluted share 248 million or 012 per diluted share and 170 million or 008 per diluted share respectively the tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020

in january 2018 may 2018 august 2018 and november 2018 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 009 per share total dividend payments in 2018 were 673 million 

in january 2017 may 2017 august 2017 and november 2017 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share total dividend payments in 2017 were 554 million 

in january 2016 may 2016 august 2016 and november 2016 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share total dividend payments in 2016 were 486 million 

in january 2019 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 009 per share to be paid on march 22 2019 to shareholders of record as of february 22 2019 payment of future cash dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition 

in january 2015 our board of directors cancelled the november 2010 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to 500 million of common stock in 2016 we repurchased 68 million shares of common stock at an average price of 2139 for a total cost of 1463 million the cumulative repurchases as of december 31 2016 totaled 225 million shares of common stock for 446 million at an average price per share of 1987

in january 2018 our board of directors cancelled the december 2016 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to 15 billion of common stock the cumulative repurchases as of december 31 2018 totaled 216 million shares of common stock for 8235 million at an average price per share of 3806 we intend to repurchase 500 million in 2019 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months we also have a 350 million revolving credit facility as of march 1 2019 we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

asc 71520 “ compensation—retirement benefits—defined benefit plans ” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

  

for the year ended december 31 2018 our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 03 million pension expense or income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense income and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their forecast of asset class return expectations we believe that 425 was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2018 the december 31 2018 asset allocation for our us plan was 94 invested in fixed income securities 5 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the ftse pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 415 at december 31 2018 up from 340 at december 31 2017 we estimate that in 2019 we will recognize approximately 04 million of pension expense for the us plan the us plan pension expense estimate for 2019 is based on a 415 discount rate and a 425 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

as of december 31 2018 our pension plans had unrecognized pension prior service cost of 01 million 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential us plan income expense for the year ending december 31 2019 which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2019 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

 

 the assets of the us plan consist substantially of fixed income securities us plan assets have decreased from 3245 million at december 31 2017 to 1443 million at december 31 2018 while the us plan’s liability decreased from 3070 million at december 31 2017 to 1274 million at december 31 2018 the decrease in assets and liabilities for the us plan is due primarily to the purchase of a group annuity insurance contract in 2018 under the group annuity the accrued pension obligations for approximately 1700 retiree participants were transferred to an insurance company the reduction in the pension benefit obligation and pension assets was 1513 million we recorded a settlement loss of 03 million related to the retiree group annuity transaction 

  

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2018 we made contributions of 26 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 08 million to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries in 2019 we expect to contribute approximately 27 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan contributions to be made in 2019 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately 09 million 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note o “stockbased compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21 2013 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 320 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 304 million shares issuable thereunder at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 12 2015 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to extend its term until may 12 2025 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2018 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

   the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2018 was 7873477 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting 

  

measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock 

as of december 31 2018 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units and options was 44 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 years

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

on january 26 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment” the new guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill all other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary the same onestep impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units even those with zero or negative carrying amounts entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts the revised guidance will be applied prospectively and is effective in 2020 early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after january 1 2017 we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position results of operations and statements of cash flows 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases topic 842” the guidance in this asu supersedes the lease recognition requirements in asc topic 840 “leases” the new standard establishes a right ofuse “rou” model that requires a lessee to record an rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all 

  

leases with terms longer than twelve months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements in july 2018 the fasb issued asu 201811 “leases topic 842 targeted improvements” which amends asu 201602 the new asu offers an additional transition method by which entities may elect not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of adoption and allows lessors to elect a practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease components when certain conditions are met this asu has the same transition requirements and effective date as asu 201602 we elected not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of adoption we adopted this guidance in january 2019 as a result we recorded between 50 and 60 million of operating lease rightofuse assets and operating lease liabilities adoption had an immaterial impact on our results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable there were no customers who accounted for more than 10 of our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 

in addition to market risks we have an equity price risk related to the fair value of our convertible senior unsecured notes issued in december 2016 in december 2016 teradyne issued 460 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 as of december 31 2018 the notes had a fair value of 5471 million the table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10 changes of teradyne’s stock price as of the end of 2018 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the notes the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such event may have on the fair value of the notes the fair value of the notes is subject to equity price risk due to the convertible feature the fair value of the notes will generally increase as teradyne’s common stock price increases and will generally decrease as the common stock price declines in value the change in stock price affects the fair value of the convertible senior notes but does not impact teradyne’s financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation additionally we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only in connection with the offering of the notes we also sold warrants to the option counterparties these transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes the warrants along with any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the average market price of our common stock for a given reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price or conversion price of the warrants or notes respectively

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in japanese yen british pound korean won taiwan dollar singapore dollar euro philippine peso and chinese yuan these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the netherlands united states and singapore related to shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in the fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2018 and 2017

summary of revenues by reportable segment 

our four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues for each of the last three years 

 

 sales and distribution 

in 2017 and 2016 revenues from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd accounted for 13 and 12 respectively of our consolidated revenues in 2016 and 2015 revenues from ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for 12 and 13 respectively of our consolidated revenues taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and ja mitsui leasing ltd are customers of our semiconductor test segment in each of the years 2017 2016 and 2015 our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 32 36 and 34 of our consolidated revenues respectively 

osat customers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd often purchase our test systems based upon recommendations from oems idms and fabless companies in all cases when an osat customer purchases a test system from us we consider the osat as the customer since credit risk title and risk of loss among other things are between teradyne and the osat we estimate product demand driven by a single oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and its leasing company ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for approximately 22 26 and 23 of our consolidated revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the loss of or significant decrease in demand from this oem customer or any of our five largest direct customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales and service offices located throughout north america asia and europe we sell in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force except for industrial automation products which are sold through distributors our manufacturing activities are primarily conducted through subcontractors and outsourced contract manufacturers with significant operations in china and malaysia 

sales to customers outside the united states were 88 87 and 87 respectively of our consolidated revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site 

  

sales to customers by country outside of the united states that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in any of the previous three years were as follows 

 

 see also “item 1a risk factors” and note r “operating segment geographic and significant customer information” in notes to consolidated financial statements

some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian companies and from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2017 and 2016 our backlog of unfilled orders in our four reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2017 approximately 99 of the semiconductor test backlog 97 of the system test backlog and 69 of the industrial automation backlog is expected to be delivered in 2018 the above table does not include any adjustments for adoption of the new revenue standard that was adopted january 1 2018 if the wireless test backlog were calculated based upon the new revenue standard the 2017 backlog balance would be 213 million with approximately 68 expected to be delivered in 2018 backlog for each of the other reportable segments would not be materially affected by adoption of the new revenue standard 

  

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without advanced notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers some of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2017 we employed approximately 4500 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 our engineering and development expenditures were 3057 million 2910 million and 2923 million respectively these expenditures accounted for approximately 143 166 and 178 of our consolidated revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it 

  

becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

  

our executive officers 

pursuant to general instruction g3 of form 10k the following table is included in part i of this annual report on form 10k in lieu of being included in the proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders the table sets forth the names of all of our executive officers and certain other information relating to their positions held with teradyne and other business experience our executive officers do not have a specific term of office but rather serve at the discretion of the board of directors

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by global and industryspecific economic cycles which are difficult to predict and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality 

  

within those industries these cycles have resulted in periods of oversupply a trend we believe will continue to occur for newer generations of electronic products our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable increased risk of restructuring charges and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues which in each case and together adversely affect our operating results we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including implementing cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or marketspecific disruptions that might affect our test businesses and we may need to take additional or different measures in the future 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics that may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2017 2016 and 2015 our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 32 36 and 34 of consolidated revenues respectively we estimate product demand driven by a single oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and its leasing company ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for approximately 22 26 and 23 of our consolidated revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions such as we experienced in our wireless test segment would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors could impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and malaysia and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan china singapore and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may be subject to product recalls and warranty and product liability claims 

we invest significant resources in the design manufacture and testing of our products however we may discover design or manufacturing defects in our products after they have been shipped and as a result we may incur development and remediation costs and be required to settle warranty and product liability claims in addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or safety issues we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation which could make it more difficult to sell our products any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a 

  

material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform 

we depend on flex ltd “flex” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flex or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

in june 2015 we acquired universal robots we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring universal robots or successfully grow universal robots’ business we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash incurring debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

in the second quarter of 2016 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment loss of 2549 million and 833 million intangible asset impairment in our wireless test segment as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market 

  

the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer who has contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption no impairment was identified in 2017 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2017 we have not incurred material costs as a result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative regulatory or governmental proceedings including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could 

  

have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results or cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in december 2015 we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2015 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were 248 million or 012 per diluted share 170 million or 008 per diluted share and 115 million or 005 per diluted share respectively 

in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to maintain or obtain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

we may need to adjust estimates resulting from the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax reform act” making significant changes to the internal revenue code among other changes the tax reform act permanently reduces the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after 

  

december 31 2017 shifts the us tax regime from a worldwide system to a modified territorial tax system and requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted as a result of the tax reform act in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded a provisional amount of 1860 million of additional income tax expense primarily composed of 1610 million of expense related to the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 336 million of expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and a benefit of 103 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions the provisional amount represents our best estimate of the impact of the tax reform act in accordance with our understanding of the tax reform act and available guidance as of the date of this filing and may change as additional guidance is provided by tax authorities or as changes are made in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax reform act any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded in 2018 adjustments may impact our financial results in a given reporting period 

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note k “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program 

in january 2014 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share in january 2017 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to 007 per share and in january 2018 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to 009 per share in january 2018 our board of directors approved a new 15 billion share repurchase authorization we intend to repurchase 750 million in 2018 our december 2016 stock repurchase program was terminated in 2017 and 2016 we repurchased 200 million and 146 million of common stock respectively holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness 

on december 12 2016 we completed a private offering of 4600 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 and received net proceeds after issuance costs of approximately 4508 million 330 million of which was used to pay the net cost after being partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the warrants of the convertible note hedge transactions and 501 million of which was used to repurchase 2 million shares of our common stock holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving us or the holders may elect to convert into shares of our common stock 

  

on april 27 2015 we entered into a fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 3500 million subject to customary conditions we may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders incremental commitments under the credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 1500 million we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility we could borrow funds under this credit facility at any time for general corporate purposes and working capital 

the issuance of the notes and any additional indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

  

 our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the “note hedge transactions” with the initial purchasers or their affiliates the “option counterparties” the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the notes with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes of 3180 the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 145 million shares of our common stock 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties the “warrant transactions” in which we sold netsharesettled or at our election subject to certain conditions cashsettled warrants to the option counterparties the warrant transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 145 million shares of our common stock the strike price of the warrants is 3991 per share the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants 

the note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants the net cost of the note hedge transactions after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 330 million 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the option counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor purchase shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the option counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 

if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the 

  

notes or certain of our other obligations we would be in default under the terms thereof which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial position and operating results in addition we cannot be certain that we would be able to repay amounts due on the notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations or if the holders of the notes require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving us moreover we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 

restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies 

the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability among other things to incur additional secured indebtedness sell transfer license or dispose of assets consolidate or merge enter into transactions with our affiliates and incur liens in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest such as subject to permitted exceptions making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds making investments loans and other advances and prepaying any additional indebtedness while our indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility is outstanding our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we rely on various information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including confidential data and to carry out and support a variety of business activities including manufacturing research and development supply chain management sales and accounting a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or 

  

infrastructure or those of our suppliers and other service providers including as a result of cyber attacks could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs 

we may face risks associated with shareholder activism 

publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or divestitures we may become subject in the future to such shareholder activity and demands such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price 

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law may make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors wireless products data storage and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics wireless automotive industrial computing communications and aerospace and defense industries our industrial automation products include collaborative robots used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include 

 

  

  

  

 we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers “osats” original equipment manufacturers “oems” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics manufacturers of circuit boards automotive suppliers wireless product manufacturers storage device manufacturers aerospace and military contractors and distributors that sell collaborative robots 

the market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment one customer drives significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customer’s supply partners we expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future 

in 2015 we acquired universal robots as “universal robots” the leading supplier of collaborative robots which are lowcost easytodeploy and simpletoprogram robots that work side by side with production workers to improve quality increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs universal robots is a separate operating and reportable segment industrial automation the acquisition of universal robots provides a growth engine to our business and complements our existing system test and wireless test segments the total purchase price for universal robots was approximately 315 million which included cash paid of approximately 284 million and 32 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and earnings targets through 2018 contingent consideration for the period from july 2015 to december 2017 was 245 million and is expected to be paid in march 2018 contingent consideration for 2015 was 15 million and was paid in february 2016 the remaining maximum contingent consideration that could be paid is 25 million 

we believe our recent acquisition has enhanced our opportunities for growth we intend to continue to invest in our business grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a 

  

significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations the sharp swings in the semiconductor and electronics industries have generally affected the semiconductor and electronics test equipment and services industries more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 

in the second quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment reduced headcount by 11 as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer who had previously contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test following the interim goodwill impairment test we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2549 million with approximately 80 million of goodwill remaining and 833 million for the impairment of acquired intangible assets with approximately 36 million of acquired intangible assets remaining at december 31 2017 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues including revenues from distributors when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur except when title transfer is tied to cash payment outside the united states outside the united states we recognize revenues upon shipment or at delivery destination point even if we retain a form of title to products delivered to customers provided the sole purpose is to enable us to recover the products in the event of customer payment default and the arrangement does not prohibit the customer’s use or resale of the product in the ordinary course of business 

our equipment has nonsoftware and embedded software components that function together to deliver the equipment’s essential functionality revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenues to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenues to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “besp” for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 

  

our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customers’ ability to use the product we defer revenues for the selling price of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenues in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 60520 “ separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts ” and asc 60525 “ revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements ” service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed 

our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues 

we do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

translation of nonus currencies 

the functional currency for all nonus subsidiaries is the us dollar except for the industrial automation segment for which the local currency is its functional currency all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period all foreign currency denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other income expense net for industrial automation assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period revenues and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

retirement and postretirement plans 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 “ compensation—stock compensation ” upon adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201609 “compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” in the first quarter of 2017 we made an accounting policy election to continue accounting for forfeitures by applying an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest in accordance with asu 201609 starting in the first quarter of 

  

2017 excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are recognized as a discrete tax benefit or discrete tax expense to the current income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations and are reported as cash flows from operating activities a cumulative effect adjustment of 391 million for any prior year excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies not previously recorded was recorded as an increase to retained earnings and deferred tax assets all cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf for withheld shares are presented as financing activities on the statement of cash flows in 2017 we recognized a discrete tax benefit of 63 million related to net excess tax benefit 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740 “ accounting for income taxes ” this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities estimates of projected future taxable income and taxplanning strategies although realization is not assured based on our assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets net of the existing valuation allowance will be realized

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities ” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

 goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

in the second quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment reduced headcount by 11 as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer who had previously contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test following the interim goodwill impairment test we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2549 million with approximately 80 million of goodwill remaining 

no goodwill impairment was identified in the fourth quarter of 2017 2016 and 2015 as part of the annual goodwill impairment test 

  

we assess the impairment of intangible and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 

as a result of the interim goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2016 described above we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segment’s intangible and longlived assets based on the comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets and recorded an 833 million acquired intangible assets impairment charge with approximately 36 million of intangible assets remaining at december 31 2017 there were no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of acquired intangible and longlived assets may not be recoverable in 2017 and 2015 as such no impairment test was performed when we determine that the carrying value of intangible and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total net revenues included in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

   

book to bill ratio 

book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows 

 

 revenues 

revenues for our four reportable segments were as follows 

 

 the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 2943 million or 22 from 2016 to 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales in the microcontroller power management flash memory and automotive safety test segments and an increase in service revenues the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 1667 million or 14 from 2015 to 2016 was driven primarily by systemonachip “soc” product volume in the mobile application processor market 

the increase in system test revenues of 23 million or 1 from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to higher service revenue in defenseaerospace test instrumentation and systems the decrease in system test revenues of 218 million or 10 from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to lower sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers 

the increase in industrial automation revenues of 711 million or 72 from 2016 to 2017 was due to higher demand for collaborative robots the acquisition of universal robots completed in june 2015 added 990 million of revenues in 2016 and 419 million of revenues in 2015 

the increase in wireless test revenues of 157 million or 16 from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to higher demand for connectivity test systems and higher service revenue the decrease in wireless test revenues of 884 million or 48 from 2015 to 2016 was driven by lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems primarily from our largest wireless test segment customer 

  

our four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues 

 

 revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 1 

 

  

 the breakout of product and service revenues was as follows 

 

 our product revenues increased 3315 million or 23 in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher sales across all semiconductor test products and higher sales in industrial automation service revenues which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and include equipment maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 519 million or 17 

our product revenues increased 1126 million or 8 in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher volume in the mobile application processor market in semiconductor test and the addition of universal robots in june 2015 partially offset by a decrease in wireless test revenues due to lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems and lower sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers for cloud storage 

in 2017 revenues from one customer accounted for 13 of our consolidated revenues in 2016 two customers each accounted for 12 of our consolidated revenues in 2015 revenues from one customer accounted for 13 of our consolidated revenues in each of the years 2017 2016 and 2015 our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 32 36 and 34 respectively of our consolidated revenues we estimate product 

  

demand driven by a single oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 22 26 and 23 of our consolidated revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

gross profit 

 

 gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased from 2016 to 2017 by 26 points as a result of a 15 point increase related to favorable product mix in semiconductor test and a 11 point increase due to higher sales primarily in semiconductor test and industrial automation 

gross profit as a percent of total revenues decreased from 2015 to 2016 by 11 points of which a 25 point decrease was related to product mix and sales of previously leased testers in semiconductor test in 2015 and lower wireless test sales partially offset by a 06 point increase due to lower pension expense related to actuarial gains in 2016 compared to actuarial losses in 2015 a 05 point increase due to higher product volume and a 03 point increase due to lower excess and obsolete inventory provisions 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenues information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future product demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test industrial automation and system test segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded an inventory provision of 88 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products of the 88 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 46 million was related to semiconductor test 22 million was related to wireless test and 19 million was related to system test 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded an inventory provision of 175 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of the 175 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 97 million was in semiconductor test 72 million was in wireless test and 06 million was related to system test 

  

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded an inventory provision of 213 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

 during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we scrapped 144 million 152 million and 70 million of inventory respectively and sold 75 million 100 million and 79 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2017 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1029 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 326 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to higher variable compensation across all segments and higher spending in universal robots partially offset by lower spending in wireless test 

the increase of 94 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2015 to 2016 was due to 226 million of additional costs as a result of the acquisition of universal robots in june 2015 partially offset by lower pension expense related to 09 million of actuarial gains in 2016 as compared to actuarial losses of 48 million in 2015 and lower variable compensation 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 147 million in engineering and development expenses from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to higher variable compensation across all segments and higher spending in system test and industrial automation partially offset by lower spending in wireless test and semiconductor test 

the decrease of 13 million in engineering and development expenses from 2015 to 2016 was due primarily to lower pension expense related to 12 million of actuarial gains in 2016 compared to 47 million of actuarial losses in 2015 partially offset by additional costs as a result of the acquisition of universal robots in june 2015 

  

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2016 to 2017 primarily in the wireless test segment due to the impairment of acquired intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016 and in the industrial automation segment due to intangible assets that became fully amortized in june 2017 acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2015 to 2016 due to lower amortization expense in the wireless test segment due to the impairment of acquired intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016 partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the universal robots acquisition in june 2015 

goodwill impairment 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in the second quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment reduced headcount by 11 as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer which had contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test following the interim goodwill impairment test we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2549 million in the second quarter of 2016 the fourth quarter 2017 2016 and 2015 goodwill impairment tests did not identify any goodwill impairments 

acquired intangible assets impairment 

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate if undiscounted cash flows for the asset are less than the carrying amount the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment contain management’s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segment’s intangible and longlived assets based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets as a result of the analysis we recorded an 833 million impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 in acquired intangible assets impairment on the statements of operations 

restructuring and other 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded an expense of 78 million for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability 38 million of severance charges related to headcount reduction of 91 people of which 75 people were in semiconductor test and 8 people each in industrial automation and in corporate 11 million for an impairment of fixed assets in semiconductor test 10 million for a lease impairment of a wireless test facility in sunnyvale ca which was terminated in september 2017 and 08 million of expenses related to an earthquake in kumamoto japan partially offset by 51 million of property insurance recovery related to the japan earthquake 

  

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded an expense of 159 million for the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability of which 153 million was related to universal robots and 06 million was related to ait 60 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 146 people of which 102 people were in wireless test and 44 people were in semiconductor test 42 million for an impairment of fixed assets and 09 million for expenses related to an earthquake in kumamoto japan partially offset by 51 million of property insurance recovery related to the japan earthquake 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded an expense of 53 million for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability 15 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 23 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test and 10 million for acquisition costs related to universal robots partially offset by a 29 million gain from fair value adjustments to decrease the acquisition contingent consideration liability of which 16 million was related to ztec and 13 million was related to ait 

the remaining accrual for severance of 14 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by december 2018 

interest and other 

 

 interest income increased by 85 million from 2016 to 2017 and by 21 million from 2015 to 2016 due primarily to higher cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates 

interest expense increased by 181 million from 2016 to 2017 due primarily to interest expense related to our convertible senior notes interest expense increased by 17 million from 2015 to 2016 due primarily to 10 million of interest expense related to our convertible senior notes in 2016 and 07 million related to revolving credit facility costs and realized losses on sales of marketable securities in 2016 

other income expense net includes net foreign exchange losses in 2015 other income expense net included a 54 million gain from the sale of an equity investment 

income loss before income taxes 

 

  

   

the increase in income before income taxes in semiconductor test from 2016 to 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales and higher gross margin due to favorable product mix the increase in income before income taxes in wireless test from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in 2016 lower intangible assets amortization lower operating expenses higher demand for connectivity test systems and higher service revenue in 2017 the decrease in income before income taxes in system test from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to lower sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers for cloud storage and increased spending for new product development the increase in income before income taxes in industrial automation was due primarily to higher demand for collaborative robots 

the decrease in income before income taxes from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a 2549 million goodwill impairment charge and an 833 million acquired intangible assets impairment charge related to wireless test in 2016 and amortization of intangible assets related to our june 2015 acquisition of universal robots which is our industrial automation segment partially offset by higher revenues in the semiconductor test application processor market and 32 million of pension actuarial gains in 2016 as compared to actuarial losses of 177 million in 2015 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2017 totaled 2667 million income tax benefit for 2016 totaled 116 million income tax expense for 2015 totaled 466 million the effective tax rate for 2017 2016 and 2015 was 509 211 and 184 respectively 

the increase in the effective tax rate from 2016 to 2017 is primarily attributable to the effect of changes in us federal tax law on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax reform act” making significant changes to the internal revenue code among other changes the tax reform act permanently reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 shifts the us tax regime from a worldwide system to a modified territorial tax system and requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred 

we recorded a provisional amount of 1860 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 which represents our best estimate of the impact of the tax reform act in accordance with our understanding of the tax reform act and available guidance as of the date of this filing the 1860 million is primarily composed of expense of 1610 million related to the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 336 million of expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and benefit of 103 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions 

the change in the effective rate was also impacted by the us nondeductible goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016 a shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased income subject to taxation in the us relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions decreases in the discrete benefits from tax reserve releases increases in discrete expense from nontaxable foreign exchange gains and losses and an increase in the discrete benefit from stockbased compensation 

the increase in the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 resulted from a shift in the geographic distribution of income which decreased income subject to taxation in the us relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions reductions in uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of statutes and the settlement of an audit and an increase in nontaxable foreign exchange gains these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by the effect of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge which reduced the benefit of the loss before income taxes in the us 

  

we qualify for a tax holiday in singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the singapore economic development board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were 248 million or 012 per diluted share 170 million or 008 per diluted share and 115 million or 005 per diluted share respectively the tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020

retirement plans 

asc 71520 “ compensation—retirement benefits—defined benefit plans ” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability 

  

represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

for the year ended december 31 2017 our pension income which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 21 million the largest portion of our 2017 pension income was 79 million for our us plan pension expense or income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense income and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their forecast of asset class return expectations we believe that 40 was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2017 the december 31 2017 asset allocation for our us plan was 88 invested in fixed income securities 10 invested in equity securities and 2 invested in other securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 34 at december 31 2017 down from 39 at december 31 2016 we estimate that in 2018 we will recognize approximately 18 million of pension income for the us plan the us plan pension income estimate for 2018 is based on a 34 discount rate and a 43 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

as of december 31 2017 our pension plans had unrecognized pension prior service cost of 01 million 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential us plan income expense for the year ending december 31 2018 which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2018 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

 

 the assets of the us plan consist substantially of fixed income securities us plan assets have increased from 3073 million at december 31 2016 to 3245 million at december 31 2017 while the us plan’s liability increased from 2996 million at december 31 2016 to 3070 million at december 31 2017 

  

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2017 we made contributions of 19 million to the us plan 26 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 09 million to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries in 2018 we expect to contribute approximately 19 million to the us plan and 25 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan contributions to be made in 2018 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately 09 million 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note o “stockbased compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21 2013 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 320 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 304 million shares issuable thereunder at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 12 2015 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to extend its term until may 12 2025 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2017 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

   the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2017 was 8604184 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

on february 15 2018 the fasb issued asu 201802 “income statement—reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income” this asu allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we do not expect this asu to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and statements of cash flows 

on march 10 2017 the fasb issued asu 201707 “compensation—retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost ” this asu provides guidance on presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost the new standard requires the service cost component to be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period the other components of net benefit cost such as interest cost amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains or losses are required to be presented separately outside of income or loss from operations the presentation of service cost should be applied 

  

retrospectively the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted this guidance will impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of the new standard we will present interest cost amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains or losses within other income expense net 

on january 26 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment” the new guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill all other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary the same onestep impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units even those with zero or negative carrying amounts entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts the revised guidance will be applied prospectively and is effective in 2020 early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after january 1 2017 we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position results of operations and statements of cash flows 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 201616 “accounting for income taxes intraentity asset transfers of assets other than inventory  ” under current generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the tax effects of intraentity asset transfers are deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use the new guidance requires recognition of the tax expense from the sale of the asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs even though the pretax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation any deferred tax asset that arises in the buyer’s jurisdiction would also be recognized at the time of the transfer the new guidance does not apply to intraentity transfers of inventory the income tax consequences from the sale of inventory from one member of a consolidated entity to another will continue to be deferred until the inventory is sold to a third party the new guidance will be effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted the modified retrospective approach will be required for transition to the new guidance with a cumulativeeffect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption we do not expect this asu to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and statements of cash flows 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases topic 842” the guidance in this asu supersedes the lease recognition requirements in accounting standards codification “asc” topic 840 “leases” the new standard establishes a rightofuse “rou” model that requires a lessee to record an rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position and results of operations 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 “financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  ” this asu provides guidance for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the new pronouncement revises accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value among other things it amends the presentation and disclosure requirements of equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method changes in the fair value of these equity securities will be recognized directly in net income this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 we do not expect this asu to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which will replace numerous requirements in us gaap including industryspecific requirements and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers the core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to show the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services in august 2015 fasb issued asu 201514 which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year for us the standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2018 the two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented or the modified retrospective method in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application we have selected the modified retrospective transition method we have completed our preliminary assessment of the financial statement impact of the new standard and expect that the cumulative effect adjustment recognized to retained earnings on january 1 2018 will be approximately 12 million primarily as a result of recognizing revenues for software licenses at the time of delivery since the vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” requirement for undelivered elements such as postcontract support is eliminated companies are allowed to use established or best estimate selling price for the undelivered element to allocate and defer the revenue as a result we will recognize as revenue upon delivery of the software and defer a portion of the sales price for the estimated selling price of postcontract support compared to the current practice of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over the term of the postcontract support period due to the lack of vsoe the 12 million adjustment to retained earnings reflects acceleration of approximately 16 million in revenues net of less than 1 million in cost of revenues and approximately 3 million of income tax expense this preliminary assessment is based on a review of the types and number of revenue arrangements in place including the review of individual customer contracts based on our preliminary assessment we do not expect any major changes to be made to existing accounting systems or internal controls

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable there were no customers who accounted for more than 10 of our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 

in addition to market risks we have an equity price risk related to the fair value of our convertible senior unsecured notes issued in december 2016 in december 2016 teradyne issued 460 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 as of december 31 2017 the notes had a fair value of 6595 million the table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10 changes of teradyne’s stock price as of the end of 2017 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the notes the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such event may have on the fair value of the notes the fair value of the notes is subject to equity price risk due to the convertible feature the fair value of the notes will generally increase as teradyne’s common stock price increases and will generally decrease as the common stock price declines in value the change in stock price affects the fair value of the convertible senior notes but does not impact teradyne’s financial position cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation additionally we carry the notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet and we present the fair value for required disclosure 

  

purposes only in connection with the offering of the notes we also sold warrants to the option counterparties these transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes the warrants along with any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the average market price of our common stock for a given reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price or conversion price of the warrants or notes respectively 

 

 see note h “debt” for further information 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in japanese yen british pound korean won taiwan dollar singapore dollar and euro these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the netherlands united states and singapore related to shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in the fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2017 and 2016

summary of revenues by reportable segment 

our four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues for each of the last three years 

 

 sales and distribution 

in 2016 revenues from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for 12 and 12 respectively of our consolidated revenues taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and ja mitsui leasing ltd are customers of our semiconductor test segment in 2015 revenues from ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for 13 of our consolidated revenues in 2014 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in each of the years 2016 2015 and 2014 our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 36 34 and 30 of our consolidated revenues respectively 

osat customers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd often purchase our test systems based upon recommendations from oems idms and fabless companies in all cases when an osat customer purchases a test system from us we consider the osat as the customer since credit risk title and risk of loss among other things are between teradyne and the osat we estimate product demand driven by a single oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and its leasing company ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for approximately 25 23 and 22 of our consolidated revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the loss of or significant decrease in demand from this oem customer or any of our five largest direct customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales and service offices located throughout north america asia and europe we sell in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force except for industrial automation segment products which are sold through distributors our manufacturing activities are primarily conducted through subcontractors and outsourced contract manufacturers with significant operations in china and malaysia 

sales to customers outside the united states were 87 of our consolidated revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site 

  

sales to customers by country outside of the united states that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in any of the previous three years were as follows

competitors in our industrial automation segment include manufacturers of traditional industrial robots such as kuka robotics corporation abb fanuc and yaskawa electric corporation as well as emerging companies developing collaborative robots 

some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2016 and 2015 our backlog of unfilled orders in our four reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2016 approximately 99 of the semiconductor test backlog 97 of the system test backlog 50 of wireless test backlog and 100 of the industrial automation backlog is expected to be delivered in 2017 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without advanced notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers some of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2016 we employed approximately 4300 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 our engineering and development expenditures were 2910 million 2923 million and 2916 million respectively these expenditures accounted for approximately 166 178 and 177 of our consolidated revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

  

our executive officers 

pursuant to general instruction g3 of form 10k the following table is included in part i of this annual report on form 10k in lieu of being included in the proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders the table sets forth the names of all of our executive officers and certain other information relating to their positions held with teradyne and other business experience our executive officers do not have a specific term of office but rather serve at the discretion of the board of directors

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by global and industryspecific economic cycles which are difficult to predict and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries these cycles have resulted in periods of oversupply a trend we believe will continue to 

  

occur for newer generations of electronic products our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable increased risk of restructuring charges and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues which in each case and together adversely affect our operating results we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including implementing cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or marketspecific disruptions that might affect our test businesses and we may need to take additional or different measures in the future 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics that may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2016 2015 and 2014 our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 36 34 and 30 of consolidated revenues respectively we estimate product demand driven by a single oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats which include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and its leasing company ja mitsui leasing ltd accounted for approximately 25 23 and 22 of our consolidated revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions such as we experienced in our wireless test segment would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors could impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and malaysia and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan china singapore and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may be subject to product recalls and warranty and product liability claims 

we invest significant resources in the design manufacture and testing of our products however we may discover design or manufacturing defects in our products after they have been shipped and as a result we may incur development and remediation costs and be required to settle warranty and product liability claims in addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or safety issues we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation which could make it more difficult to sell our products any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a 

  

material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform 

we depend on flex ltd “flex” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flex or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

in june 2015 we acquired universal robots we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring universal robots or successfully grow universal robots’ business we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash incurring debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

in the second quarter of 2016 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment loss of 2549 million and 833 million intangible asset impairment in our wireless test segment as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market 

  

the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer who has contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2016 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative regulatory or governmental proceedings including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results or cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in december 2015 teradyne entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2015 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were 170 million or 008 per diluted share 115 million or 005 per diluted share and 132 million or 006 per diluted share respectively 

in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to maintain or obtain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

  

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note k “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program 

in january 2014 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share in january 2017 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to 007 per share in december 2016 our board of directors approved a new 500 million share repurchase authorization that commenced on january 1 2017 we intend to repurchase at least 200 million in 2017 our january 2015 stock repurchase program was terminated on december 31 2016 in 2016 and 2015 we repurchased 146 million and 300 million of common stock respectively holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness 

on december 12 2016 we completed a private offering of 4600 million aggregate principal amount of 125 convertible senior unsecured notes the “notes” due december 15 2023 and received net proceeds after issuance costs of approximately 4508 million 330 million of which was used to pay the net cost after being partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the warrants of the convertible note hedge transactions and 501 million of which was used to repurchase 2 million shares of our common stock holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving us or the holders may elect to convert into shares of our common stock 

on april 27 2015 we entered into a fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 3500 million subject to customary conditions we may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders incremental commitments under the credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 1500 million we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility we could borrow funds under this credit facility at any time for general corporate purposes and working capital 

the issuance of the notes and any additional indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

  

   

our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the “note hedge transactions” with the initial purchasers or their affiliates the “option counterparties” the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the notes with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the notes of 3184 the note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 144 million shares of our common stock 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties the “warrant transactions” in which we sold netsharesettled or at our election subject to certain conditions cashsettled warrants to the option counterparties the warrant transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 144 million shares of our common stock the strike price of the warrants will initially be 3995 per share subject to adjustment which was approximately 60 above the closing sale price of our common stock on december 6 2016 the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants 

the note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants the net cost of the note hedge transactions after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 330 million 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the option counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor purchase shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the option counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 

if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of our other obligations we would be in default under the terms thereof which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial position and operating results in addition we cannot be certain that we would be able to repay amounts due on the notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations or if the holders of the notes require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving us moreover we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 

restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies 

the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability among other things to incur additional secured indebtedness sell transfer license or dispose of assets consolidate or merge enter into transactions with our affiliates and incur liens in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our 

  

long term best interest such as subject to permitted exceptions making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds making investments loans and other advances and prepaying any additional indebtedness while our indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility is outstanding our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

in 2016 an earthquake in japan damaged our building beyond repair and impacted our operations located in kumamoto japan we have temporarily transferred the manufacturing operations to other facilities so we do not expect the damage to have a significant impact on our ability to manufacture our products or sell products to our customers however the situation in kumamoto remains uncertain so the events could have a shortterm impact to our business in japan in addition we may incur significant uninsured costs in order to rebuild our operations which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we rely on various information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including confidential data and to carry out and support a variety of business activities including manufacturing research and development supply chain management sales and accounting a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our suppliers and other service providers including as a result of cyber attacks could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs 

we may face risks associated with shareholder activism 

publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or divestitures we may become subject in the future to such shareholder activity and demands such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price 

  

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

in 2014 we acquired avionics interface technologies llc “ait” a supplier of equipment for testing stateoftheart data communication buses the acquisition of ait complements our defenseaerospace line of bus test instrumentation for commercial and defense avionics systems ait is included in our system test segment the total purchase price for ait was approximately 21 million which included cash paid of approximately 19 million and 2 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and gross margin targets in 2015 and 2016 the total amount of contingent consideration paid was 11 million 

we believe our recent acquisitions have enhanced our opportunities for growth we intend to continue to invest in our business grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations the sharp swings in the semiconductor and electronics industries in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor and electronics test equipment and services industries more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 

  

in recent years this cyclical demand has become an evenodd year trend where demand has increased in even years and decreased in odd years due principally to demand swings in the mobility market of our semiconductor test business we expect the evenodd year demand trend in the mobility market to most likely lessen in the future due to slower smart phone unit growth along with rising device complexity and the reduced impact of parallel test in our semiconductor test business 

on april 16 2016 an earthquake in kumamoto japan damaged our main building at that location the building which was used for engineering production and support operations was damaged beyond repair with respect to the location we have 10 million of earthquake insurance with a deductible of approximately 25 million as a result we impaired the building and recorded a charge of 42 million and a charge of 12 million for other earthquake related expenses the 54 million of total charges were offset by 54 million of property insurance recovery we have temporarily transferred some operations to other facilities in japan and elsewhere while our kumamoto operations are restored 

in the second quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment reduced headcount by 11 as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer who has contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test following the interim goodwill impairment test we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2549 million with approximately 80 million of goodwill remaining and 833 million for the impairment of acquired intangible assets with approximately 50 million of intangible assets remaining in the third quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit reduced headcount by an additional 14 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues including revenues from distributors when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur except when title transfer is tied to cash payment outside the united states outside the united states we recognize revenues upon shipment or at delivery destination point even if we retain a form of title to products delivered to customers provided the sole purpose is to enable us to recover the products in the event of customer payment default and the arrangement does not prohibit the customer’s use or resale of the product in the ordinary course of business 

our equipment has nonsoftware and embedded software components that function together to deliver the equipment’s essential functionality revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to 

  

perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenues to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenues to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “besp” for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 

our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customers’ ability to use the product we defer revenues for the selling price of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenues in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 60520 “ separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts ” and asc 60525 “ revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements ” service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed 

our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues 

we do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

translation of nonus currencies 

the functional currency for all nonus subsidiaries is the us dollar except for the industrial automation segment for which the local currency is its functional currency all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period all foreign currency denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other income expense net for industrial automation assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period revenues and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

retirement and postretirement plans 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision 

  

for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 “ compensation—stock compensation ” as required by asc 718 we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740 “ accounting for income taxes ” this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities estimates of projected future taxable income and taxplanning strategies although realization is not assured based on our assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets net of the existing valuation allowance will be realized us income taxes are not provided for on the earnings of nonus subsidiaries which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the us for intraperiod tax allocations we first utilize nonequity related tax attributes such as net operating losses and credit carryforwards and then equityrelated tax attributes we use the withandwithout method for calculating excess stock compensation deductions and do not take into account any indirect impacts of excess stock compensation deductions on our research and development tax credits domestic production activities deduction and other differences between financial reporting and tax reporting 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities ” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

 goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

in the second quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment reduced headcount by 11 as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to 

  

an estimated smaller future wireless test market the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer who has contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test following the interim goodwill impairment test we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2549 million with approximately 80 million of goodwill remaining in the third quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit reduced headcount by an additional 14 no goodwill impairment was identified in the fourth quarter of 2016 as part of the annual goodwill impairment test 

no goodwill impairment was identified in 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques 

we assess the impairment of intangible and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 

as a result of the interim goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2016 described above we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segment’s intangible and longlived assets based on the comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets and recorded an 833 million acquired intangible assets impairment charge with approximately 50 million of intangible assets remaining there were no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of acquired intangible and longlived assets may not be recoverable in 2015 as such no impairment test was performed as of december 31 2015 as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 described above we also performed an impairment test of the wireless test segment’s intangible and longlived assets as of december 31 2014 with no indication of impairment when we determine that the carrying value of intangible and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total net revenues included in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

 book to bill ratio 

book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows 

 

   

revenues 

revenues for our four reportable segments were as follows 

 

 the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 1667 million or 14 from 2015 to 2016 was driven primarily by systemonachip “soc” product volume in the mobile application processor market the decrease in semiconductor test revenues of 993 million or 8 from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in soc product volume driven by smaller microcontroller power management and radio frequency test markets 

the decrease in system test revenues of 218 million or 10 from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to lower sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers used for testing drives for cloud storage applications the increase in system test revenues of 491 million or 30 from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to higher sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers used for testing drives for cloud storage applications 

the acquisition of universal robots which is our industrial automation segment completed in june 2015 added 990 million of revenues in 2016 and 419 million of revenues in 2015 

the decrease in wireless test revenues of 884 million or 48 from 2015 to 2016 was driven by lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems primarily from our largest wireless test segment customer as a result of significant customer concentration in our wireless test segment revenues in that segment are subject to significant fluctuations based on the segment’s largest customer’s order levels wireless test revenues were approximately flat from 2014 to 2015 as an increase in cellular product volume was offset by lower connectivity product volume 

our four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues 

 

   

revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 1 

 

  

 the breakout of product and service revenues was as follows 

 

 our product revenues increased 1126 million or 8 in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher volume in the mobile application processor market in semiconductor test and the addition of universal robots in june 2015 this increase was partially offset by decreases in wireless test revenues due to lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems and lower sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers for cloud storage service revenues which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and include equipment maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 10 million 

our product revenues decreased 234 million or 2 in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower soc product volume driven by smaller microcontroller power management and radio frequency test markets this decrease was partially offset by higher sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers for cloud storage and the addition of universal robots in 2015 service revenues increased 152 million or 5 

in 2016 two customers each accounted for 12 of our consolidated revenues in 2015 revenues from one customer accounted for 13 of our consolidated revenues in 2014 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in each of the years 2016 2015 and 2014 our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 36 34 and 30 respectively of our consolidated revenues we estimate product demand driven by a single oem customer combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s osats accounted for approximately 25 23 and 22 of our consolidated revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

gross profit 

 

 gross profit as a percent of total revenues decreased from 2015 to 2016 by 11 points of which a 25 point decrease was related to product mix and sales of previously leased testers in semiconductor test in 2015 and lower wireless test sales partially offset by a 06 points increase due to lower pension expense related to actuarial gains in 2016 compared to actuarial losses in 2015 a 05 point increase due to higher product volume and a 03 point increase due to lower excess and obsolete inventory provisions 

gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased from 2014 to 2015 by 25 points due to favorable semiconductor test product mix and sales of previously leased testers in semiconductor test 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future product demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test system test and industrial automation segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded an inventory provision of 175 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of the 175 million of total excess and obsolete provisions 97 million was in semiconductor test 72 million was in wireless test and 06 million was related to system test 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded an inventory provision of 213 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded an inventory provision of 222 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

 during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 we scrapped 152 million 70 million and 208 million of inventory respectively and sold 100 million 79 million and 131 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2016 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1160 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 the decrease of 13 million in engineering and development expenses from 2015 to 2016 was due primarily to lower pension expense related to 12 million actuarial gains in 2016 compared to 47 million of actuarial losses in 2015 partially offset by additional costs as a result of the acquisition of universal robots in june 2015 

the increase of 07 million in engineering and development expenses from 2014 to 2015 was due to 39 million of higher variable compensation 26 million of additional costs related to universal robots and a 18 million increase in spending primarily in storage test partially offset by lower pension expense related to actuarial losses of 47 million in 2015 compared to 122 million in 2014 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 94 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2015 to 2016 was due to 226 million of additional costs as a result of the acquisition of universal robots in june 2015 partially offset by lower pension expense related to 09 million of actuarial gains in 2016 as compared to actuarial losses of 48 million in 2015 and lower variable compensation 

the decrease of 134 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2014 to 2015 was due primarily to lower pension expense related to actuarial losses of 48 million in 2015 compared to 216 million in 2014 and a onetime 66 million stockbased compensation charge in 2014 related to a retirement agreement entered into with our retired chief executive officer partially offset by higher variable compensation 

  

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2015 to 2016 due to lower amortization expense in the wireless test segment due to the impairment of intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016 partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the universal robots acquisition in june 2015 acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2014 to 2015 due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the year partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the universal robots acquisition 

goodwill impairment 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in the second quarter of 2016 the wireless test reporting unit which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment reduced headcount by 11 as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer who has contributed between 51 and 73 of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015 as a result of the customer’s numerous operational efficiencies slower smartphone growth rates and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test following the interim goodwill impairment test we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2549 million in the second quarter of 2016 the fourth quarter 2016 and 2015 goodwill impairment tests did not identify any goodwill impairments in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques 

acquired intangible assets impairment 

we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate if undiscounted cash flows for the asset are less than the carrying amount the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment contain management’s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segment’s intangible and longlived assets based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets as a result of the analysis we recorded an 833 million impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 in acquired intangible assets impairment on the statements of operations 

restructuring and other 

other 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded 159 million of other charges of which 153 million was for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability 

  

06 million for the increase in the fair value of the ait contingent consideration liability 42 million for an impairment of fixed assets and 12 million for expenses related to an earthquake in kumamoto japan partially offset by 54 million of property insurance recovery related to the japan earthquake 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded 36 million of other charges of which 53 million was for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability and 10 million for acquisition costs related to universal robots partially offset by a 29 million gain from fair value adjustments to decrease the acquisition contingent consideration liability related to ztec instruments inc “ztec” 16 million and ait 13 million 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded a 06 million gain from the fair value adjustment to decrease the ztec acquisition contingent consideration partially offset by 04 million of acquisition costs related to ait 

restructuring 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded 60 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 146 people of which 102 people were in wireless test and 44 people were in semiconductor test 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded 15 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 23 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded 16 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 43 people primarily in semiconductor test and wireless test 

the remaining accrual for severance of 21 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by june 2017 

interest and other 

 

 interest income increased by 21 million from 2015 to 2016 due primarily to higher marketable securities balances and higher interest rates in 2016 interest income increased by 09 million from 2014 to 2015 due primarily to higher interest rates on marketable securities 

interest expense increased by 17 million from 2015 to 2016 due primarily to 10 million of interest expense related to our convertible senior notes in 2016 and 07 million due primarily to costs related to the revolving credit facility and realized losses on sales of marketable securities in 2016 interest expense decreased by 50 million from 2014 to 2015 due primarily to the first quarter 2014 repayment of our previously issued convertible debt 

in 2015 other income expense net included a 54 million gain from the sale of an equity investment 

  

loss income before income taxes 

 

  

 the decrease in income before income taxes from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a 2549 million goodwill impairment charge and an 833 million acquired intangible assets impairment charge related to wireless test in 2016 and amortization of intangible assets related to our june 2015 acquisition of universal robots which is our industrial automation segment partially offset by higher revenues in semiconductor test application processor market and 32 million of pension actuarial gains in 2016 as compared to actuarial losses of 177 million in 2015 

the increase in income before income taxes from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a 989 million goodwill impairment charge related to wireless test in 2014 and lower pension expense related to actuarial losses of 177 million in 2015 as compared to 466 million in 2014 actuarial losses of 466 million in 2014 were primarily related to increases in life expectancy in the us 

income taxes 

income tax benefit for 2016 totaled 116 million income tax expense for 2015 and 2014 totaled 466 million and 141 million respectively the effective tax rate for 2016 2015 and 2014 was 211 184 and 148 respectively 

the increase in the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 resulted from a shift in the geographic distribution of income which decreased income subject to taxation in the us relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions reductions in uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of statutes and the settlement of an audit and an increase in nontaxable foreign exchange gains these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by the effect of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge which reduced the benefit of the loss before income taxes in the us 

the increase in the effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 resulted from a shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased income subject to taxation in the us relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions and a reduction in the benefit from us research and development tax credits these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by decreases associated with uncertain tax positions and a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge 

we qualify for a tax holiday in singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the singapore economic development board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met the tax savings attributable to the tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were 170 million or 008 per diluted share 115 million or 005 per diluted share and 132 million or 006 per diluted share respectively the tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020

in 2014 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses acquired provided cash of 685 million this was due to a 1014 million decrease in operating assets and a 329 million decrease in operating liabilities 

the decrease in operating assets was due to a 415 million decrease in prepayments and other assets primarily related to a reduction in prepayments to our contract manufacturers a 518 million decrease in inventories due to higher sales and an 81 million decrease in accounts receivable 

the decrease in operating liabilities was due to 339 million of retirement plan contributions a 170 million decrease in other accrued liabilities a 169 million decrease in accounts payable a 73 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments and a 43 million convertible note interest payment partially offset by a 244 million increase in income taxes and a 220 million increase in customer advance payments and deferred revenue

partially offset by 213 million provided by the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans and 05 million from the tax benefit related to stock options and restricted stock units 

in january 2016 may 2016 august 2016 and november 2016 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share total dividend payments in 2016 were 486 million 

in january 2015 may 2015 august 2015 and november 2015 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share total dividend payments in 2015 were 507 million 

in january 2014 our board of directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share in each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2014 we paid a cash dividend of 006 per share total dividend payments in 2014 were 374 million 

in january 2017 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share to be paid on march 20 2017 to shareholders of record as of february 24 2017 payment of future cash dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition 

in january 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of common stock in 2015 we repurchased 156 million shares of common stock at an average price of 1920 for a total cost of 3000 million in 2016 we repurchased 68 million shares of common stock at an average price of 2139 for a total cost of 1463 million the cumulative repurchases as of december 31 2016 totaled 225 million shares of common stock for 4463 million at an average price per share of 1987 

in december 2016 our board of directors approved a new 500 million share repurchase authorization which commenced on january 1 2017 we intend to repurchase at least 200 million in 2017 our january 2015 stock repurchase program was terminated on december 31 2016 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in the us and our operations in the us provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities in the us we have approximately 768 million of cash outside the us that if repatriated would incur additional taxes determination of the additional taxes that would be incurred is not practicable due to uncertainty regarding the remittance structure the mix of earnings and earnings and profit pools in the year of remittance and overall complexity of the calculation inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

asc 71520 “ compensation—retirement benefits—defined benefit plans ” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

for the year ended december 31 2016 our pension income which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 03 million the largest portion of our 2016 pension income was 52 million for our us plan pension expense or income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense income and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate 

  

of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future in the fourth quarter of 2014 we updated the mortality assumptions related to our us retirement plans using the mortality tables published in october 2014 by the us society of actuaries the change in the mortality assumptions resulted in approximately 390 million of actuarial losses in 2014 for the us retirement plans 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their forecast of asset class return expectations we believe that 48 was an appropriate rate to use for 2016 the december 31 2016 asset allocation for our us plan was 88 invested in fixed income securities 10 invested in equity securities and 2 invested in other securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 39 at december 31 2016 down from 40 at december 31 2015 we estimate that in 2017 we will recognize approximately 08 million of pension expense for the us plan the us plan pension expense estimate for 2017 is based on a 39 discount rate and a 40 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

as of december 31 2016 our pension plans had unrecognized pension prior service cost of 01 million 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential us plan income expense for the year ending december 31 2017 which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2017 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

 

 the assets of the us plan consist substantially of fixed income securities us plan assets have increased from 2984 million at december 31 2015 to 3073 million at december 31 2016 while the us plan’s liability increased from 2978 million at december 31 2015 to 2996 million at december 31 2016 

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2016 we made contributions of 19 million to the us plan 26 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 09 million to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries in 2017 we expect to contribute approximately 19 million to the us 

  

plan and 26 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan contributions to be made in 2017 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately 08 million 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note o “stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21 2013 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 320 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 304 million shares issuable thereunder at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 12 2015 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to extend its term until may 12 2025 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2016 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

    the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 

  

2006 equity plan as of december 31 2016 was 9545419 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 12 2025 

as of december 31 2016 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units and options was 406 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 23 years

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 “financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  ” this asu provides guidance for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the new pronouncement revises accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value among other things it amends the presentation and disclosure requirements of equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method changes 

  

in the fair value of these equity securities will be recognized directly in net income this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position and results of operations 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 “income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  ” asu 201517 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the balance sheet the new guidance requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet this asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented early adoption is permitted we early adopted this asu prospectively in the first quarter of 2016

 item 7a quantitative and qualitati ve disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to 

  

secure accounts receivable there were no customers who accounted for more than 10 of our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2016 one customer accounted for more than 10 of our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2015 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in japanese yen british pound korean won taiwan dollar singapore dollar and euro these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the netherlands united states and singapore related to shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in the fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2016 and 2015

backlog 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 our backlog of unfilled orders in our four reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2015 approximately 99 of the semiconductor test backlog 93 of system test backlog 46 of wireless test backlog and 100 of the industrial automation backlog is expected to be delivered in 2016 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without advanced notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers some of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can 

  

experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2015 we employed approximately 4100 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 our engineering and development expenditures were 2923 million 2916 million and 2641 million respectively these expenditures accounted for approximately 178 177 and 185 of our consolidated revenues in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

  

our executive officers 

pursuant to general instruction g3 of form 10k the following table is included in part i of this annual report on form 10k in lieu of being included in the proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders the table sets forth the names of all of our executive officers and certain other information relating to their positions held with teradyne and other business experience our executive officers do not have a specific term of office but rather serve at the discretion of the board of directors

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by global and industryspecific economic cycles which are difficult to predict and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries these cycles have resulted in periods of oversupply a trend we believe will continue to 

  

occur for newer generations of electronic products our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable increased risk of restructuring charges and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues which in each case and together adversely affect our operating results we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including implementing cost control and reduction measures if our businesses experience further downturns whether due to a deterioration in global economic conditions or slowdowns in specific markets we serve we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or marketspecific disruptions that might affect our test businesses 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2015 2014 and 2013 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 25 21 and 26 of consolidated revenues respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to realize the estimated sales value of equipment leased to our customers may adversely affect our results of operations 

we occasionally lease equipment to our customers typically for a term of one year the cost of the leased equipment is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet and depreciated over an estimated useful life of approximately four years realization of the leased equipment’s value depends on numerous factors including the technological obsolescence of the leased equipment elections by customers to terminate a lease prior to 

  

scheduled termination the general market conditions at the time of expiration of the lease the customer’s election to renew the lease and the cost of comparable new equipment our inability to realize the value of leased equipment could cause a decrease in revenues and an increase in asset writeoffs which would in each case reduce our operating income 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors could impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan china singapore and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 25 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

  

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform  

we depend on flextronics international ltd “flextronics” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

in june 2015 we acquired universal robots we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring universal robots or successfully grow universal robots’ business we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash incurring debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site 

  

remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2015 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative regulatory or governmental proceedings including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results or cash flows 

  

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in december 2015 teradyne entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2015 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 115 million or 005 per diluted share 132 million or 006 per diluted share and 47 million or 002 per diluted share respectively 

in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to maintain or obtain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note j “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program 

in january 2014 our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend of 006 per share in january 2015 our board of directors authorized teradyne to repurchase up to 500 million of common stock in 2015 we 

  

repurchased 300 million of common stock in 2016 we intend to repurchase between 100 million and 200 million of common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may incur indebtedness 

on april 27 2015 we entered into a fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 350 million subject to customary conditions we may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders incremental commitments under the credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 150 million we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility we could borrow funds under this credit facility at any time for general corporate purposes and working capital incurring indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

  

 restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies 

the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability among other things to incur additional secured indebtedness sell transfer license or dispose of assets consolidate or merge enter into transactions with our affiliates and incur liens in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest such as subject to permitted exceptions making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds making investments loans and other advances and prepaying any additional indebtedness while our indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility is outstanding our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 

  

in our products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties this requirement could affect the pricing sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products in addition there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all minerals used in our products as a result we may be unable to certify that our products are conflict free 

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we rely on various information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including confidential data and to carry out and support a variety of business activities including manufacturing research and development supply chain management sales and accounting a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our suppliers and other service providers including as a result of cyber attacks could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs 

we may face risks associated with shareholder activism 

publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or divestitures we may become subject in the future to such shareholder activity and demands such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price 

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors wireless products data storage and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics wireless automotive industrial computing communications and aerospace and defense industries our industrial automation products include collaborative robots used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include 

 

  

  

  

 we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers “osats” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics manufacturers of circuit boards automotive suppliers wireless product manufacturers storage device manufacturers aerospace and military contractors and distributors that sell collaborative robots 

on june 11 2015 we acquired universal robots as “universal robots” for approximately 284 million of cash plus up to an additional 65 million of cash if certain performance targets are met extending through 2018 universal robots is the leading supplier of collaborative robots which are lowcost easytodeploy and simpletoprogram robots that work side by side with production workers to improve quality increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs universal robots is a separate operating and reportable segment industrial automation the acquisition of universal robots provides a growth engine to our business and complements our existing system test and wireless test segments the total purchase price for universal robots was approximately 315 million 

in 2014 we acquired avionics interface technologies llc “ait” a supplier of equipment for testing stateoftheart data communication buses the acquisition of ait complements our defenseaerospace line of bus test instrumentation for commercial and defense avionics systems ait is included in our system test 

  

segment the total purchase price for ait was approximately 21 million which included cash paid of approximately 19 million and 2 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and gross margin targets in 2015 and 2016 no contingent consideration was paid for 2015 the maximum remaining contingent consideration that could be paid is 11 million 

in 2013 we acquired ztec instruments inc “ztec” a supplier of modular wireless test instruments the acquisition of ztec expands our wireless test segment into the design verification test of wireless components and chipsets the total purchase price for ztec was approximately 17 million which included cash paid of approximately 15 million and 2 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain customer order and revenue targets through 2015 none of the contingent consideration was paid 

we believe our recent acquisitions have enhanced our opportunities for growth we will continue to invest in our business grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations the sharp swings in the semiconductor and electronics industries in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor and electronics test equipment and services industries more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur except when title transfer is tied to cash payment outside the united states outside the united states we recognize revenue upon shipment or at delivery destination point even if we retain a form of title to products delivered to customers provided the sole purpose is to enable us to recover the products in the event of customer payment default and the arrangement does not prohibit the customer’s use or resale of the product in the ordinary course of business 

our equipment has nonsoftware and embedded software components that function together to deliver the equipment’s essential functionality revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to 

  

perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “besp” for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 

our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customers’ ability to use the product we defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 60520 “separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts” and asc 60525 “revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements” service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed 

our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues 

we do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

translation of nonus currencies 

the functional currency for all nonus subsidiaries is the us dollar except for the industrial automation segment for which the local currency is its functional currency all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period all foreign currency denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other income expense net for industrial automation assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period revenue and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

retirement and postretirement plans 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision 

  

for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 “ compensation—stock compensation ” as required by asc 718 we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740 “accounting for income taxes” this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities estimates of projected future taxable income and taxplanning strategies although realization is not assured based on our assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets net of the existing valuation allowance will be realized us income taxes are not provided for on the earnings of nonus subsidiaries which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the us for intraperiod tax allocations we first utilize nonequity related tax attributes such as net operating losses and credit carryforwards and then equityrelated tax attributes we use the withandwithout method for calculating excess stock compensation deductions and do not take into account any indirect impacts of excess stock compensation deductions on its research and development tax credits domestic production activities deduction and other differences between financial reporting and tax reporting 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

 goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that excess no goodwill impairment was identified in 2015 or 2013 in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques 

  

we assess the impairment of intangible and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 

there were no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable in 2015 or 2013 as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 described above we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segment’s intangible and longlived assets based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets and there was no indication of impairment when we determine that the carrying value of intangible and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks

results of operations 

book to bill ratio 

book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows 

 

 revenues 

revenues for our four reportable segments were as follows 

 

 the decrease in semiconductor test revenues of 993 million or 8 from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in systemonachip “soc” product volume driven by smaller microcontroller power management and radio frequency test markets 

the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 2778 million or 27 from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher soc product volume driven by a larger application processor test market 

the increase in system test revenues of 491 million or 30 from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to higher sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers used for testing drives for cloud storage applications 

the increase in system test revenues of 95 million or 6 from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher product volume in storage test driven by solid state disk testers and by production board test driven by automotive test applications partially offset by lower defenseaerospace product sales 

wireless test revenues were approximately flat from 2014 to 2015 as an increase in cellular product volume was offset by lower connectivity product volume 

the decrease in wireless test revenues of 674 million or 27 from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to lower cellular and connectivity product volume driven by a smaller wireless test market 

the acquisition of universal robots completed in june of 2015 added 419 million of revenue in 2015 universal robots is our industrial automation segment 

  

our four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues 

 

 revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 1 

 

  

 the breakout of product and service revenues was as follows 

 

 our product revenues decreased 234 million or 2 in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower soc product volume driven by smaller microcontroller power management and radio frequency test markets this decrease was partially offset by higher sales in storage test of 35” hard disk drive testers for cloud storage and the addition of universal robots in 2015 service revenues which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and include equipment maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 152 million or 5 

our product revenues increased 2091 million or 18 in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in soc test product volume driven by a larger application processor test market this increase was partially offset by lower cellular and connectivity product volume in wireless test service revenues increased 108 million or 4 

in 2015 revenues from one customer accounted for 13 of our consolidated revenues in 2013 revenues from a different customer accounted for 12 of our consolidated revenues in 2014 no single customer 

  

accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in each of the years 2015 2014 and 2013 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 25 21 and 26 respectively of our consolidated revenues 

gross profit 

 

 gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased from 2014 to 2015 by 25 points due to favorable semiconductor test product mix and sales of previously leased testers in semiconductor test 

gross profit as a percent of total revenues decreased from 2013 to 2014 by 33 points of which 28 points was related to unfavorable product mix in soc semiconductor test and lower wireless test sales and 11 points was due to pension expense in 2014 as a result of increases in life expectancy in the us compared to pension income in 2013 partially offset by an increase of 11 points due to higher sales volume 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future product demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test system test and industrial automation segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded an inventory provision of 213 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

 during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded an inventory provision of 222 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

   

 during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded an inventory provision of 166 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

 during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 we scrapped 70 million 208 million and 353 million of inventory respectively and sold 79 million 131 million and 98 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2015 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1194 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 07 million in engineering and development expenses from 2014 to 2015 was due to 39 million of higher variable compensation 26 million of additional costs related to the acquisition of universal robots in june 2015 and a 18 million increase in spending primarily in storage test partially offset by lower pension expense related to actuarial losses 47 million in 2015 compared to 122 million in 2014 

the increase of 275 million from 2013 to 2014 was due primarily to 122 million of pension expense related to actuarial losses in 2014 as a result of increases in life expectancy in the us compared to 44 million of pension income related to actuarial gains in 2013 a 109 million increase in semiconductor test spending 27 million of higher variable compensation and 26 million of increased spending in wireless test partially offset by lower system test spending 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the decrease of 134 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2014 to 2015 was due primarily to lower pension expense related to actuarial losses 48 million in 2015 compared to 216 million in 2014 and a onetime 66 million stockbased compensation charge in 2014 related to a retirement agreement entered into with our retired chief executive officer partially offset by higher variable compensation 

the increase of 401 million from 2013 to 2014 was due primarily to 216 million of pension expense related to actuarial losses in 2014 as a result of increases in life expectancy in the us compared to 29 million 

  

of pension income related to actuarial gains in 2013 a onetime 66 million stockbased compensation charge in 2014 related to a retirement agreement entered into with our retired chief executive officer and increased spending in semiconductor test and corporate 

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2014 to 2015 due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the year partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the universal robots acquisition acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2013 to 2014 due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the year partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the ait acquisition 

goodwill impairment 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 the fourth quarter 2015 and 2013 goodwill impairment tests did not identify any goodwill impairments in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques 

further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

restructuring and other 

other 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded 36 million of other charges of which 53 million was for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability and 10 million for acquisition costs related to universal robots partially offset by a 29 million gain from fair value adjustments to decrease the acquisition contingent consideration liability related to ztec 16 million and ait 13 million 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded a 06 million gain from the fair value adjustment to decrease the ztec acquisition contingent consideration partially offset by 04 million of acquisition costs related to ait 

restructuring 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded 15 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 23 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded 16 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 43 people primarily in semiconductor test and wireless test 

  

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded 19 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 48 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test and a 04 million credit in corporate related to a change in the estimated exit costs related to a leased facility 

the remaining accrual for severance of 04 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by march 2016 

interest and other 

 

 interest income increased by 09 million from 2014 to 2015 due primarily to higher interest rates on marketable securities interest income increased by 22 million from 2013 to 2014 due to an increase in realized gains from the sale of marketable securities and an increase in cash and marketable securities 

interest expense decreased by 50 million from 2014 to 2015 and 192 million from 2013 to 2014 due primarily to the repayment of our convertible debt in the first quarter of 2014 

in 2015 and 2013 other income expense net included a 54 million and a 342 million gain respectively from the sale of an equity investment 

income loss before income taxes 

 

  

 the increase in income before income taxes from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a 989 million goodwill impairment charge related to wireless test in 2014 and lower pension expense related to actuarial losses of 177 million in 2015 as compared to 466 million in 2014 actuarial losses of 466 million in 2014 were primarily related to increases in life expectancy in the us 

the decrease in income before income taxes from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to a 989 million goodwill impairment charge related to wireless test and 466 million pension expense related to actuarial losses in 2014 partially offset by higher income due to higher revenues in semiconductor test in 2014 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2015 2014 and 2013 totaled 466 million 141 million and 370 million respectively the effective tax rate for 2015 2014 and 2013 was 184 148 and 183 respectively the 

  

increase in the effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 resulted from a shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased income subject to taxation in the united states relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions and a reduction in the benefit from us research and development tax credits these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by decreases associated with uncertain tax positions and a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 was primarily attributable to a shift in the geographic distribution of income which decreased income subject to taxation in the united states relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by increases in the effective tax rate associated with uncertain tax positions and a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge 

in december 2015 teradyne entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31 2015 the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 115 million or 005 per diluted share 132 million or 006 per diluted share and 47 million or 002 per diluted share respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 

 

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased 291 million to 1008 million from 2014 to 2015 

in 2015 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses acquired provided cash of 93 million this was due to a 387 million increase in operating assets and a 480 million increase in operating liabilities 

the increase in operating assets was due to a 573 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales during the last month of the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 partially offset by a 156 million decrease in inventories and a 30 million decrease in prepayments and other assets 

the increase in operating liabilities was due to a 370 million increase in accounts payable as a result of our planned inventory increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 as we added material to maintain attractive lead 

  

times a 170 million increase in customer advance payments and deferred revenue and a 113 million increase in other accrued liabilities partially offset by 121 million of retirement plans contributions and a 52 million increase in income taxes 

investing activities during 2015 used cash of 1137 million due to 14240 million used for purchases of marketable securities 2827 million used for the acquisition of universal robots and 899 million used for purchases of property plant and equipment partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of 3603 million and 13161 million respectively proceeds from the sale of an equity investment of 54 million and proceeds from life insurance of 11 million related to the cash surrender value from the cancellation of teradyne owned life insurance policies the decrease in purchases of property plant and equipment of 791 million was primarily due to an increase in purchases of testers for customer leasing in 2014 

financing activities during 2015 used cash of 3287 million due to 3000 million used for the repurchase of 156 million shares of common stock at an average price of 1920 per share 507 million used for dividend payments and 23 million used for debt issuance costs related to our april 2015 revolving credit facility partially offset by 195 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans and 47 million from the tax benefit related to employee stock compensation awards 

in 2014 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses acquired provided cash of 685 million this was due to a 1014 million decrease in operating assets and a 329 million decrease in operating liabilities 

the decrease in operating assets was due to a 415 million decrease in prepayments and other assets primarily related to a reduction in prepayments to our contract manufacturers a 518 million decrease in inventories due to higher sales and an 81 million decrease in accounts receivable 

the decrease in operating liabilities was due to 339 million of retirement plan contributions a 170 million decrease in other accrued liabilities a 169 million decrease in accounts payable a 73 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments a 43 million convertible note interest payment partially offset by a 244 million increase in income taxes and a 220 million increase in customer advance payments and deferred revenue 

investing activities during 2014 used cash of 3329 million due to 15787 million used for purchases of marketable securities and 1690 million used for purchases of property plant and equipment and 194 million used for the acquisition of ait completed in october 2014 partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 8597 million and 5704 million respectively and net proceeds from life insurance of 42 million primarily related to the cash surrender value from the cancellation of teradyne owned life insurance policies on its retired chief executive officer the increase in purchase of property plant and equipment of 623 million in 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily due to testers used for customer leases 

financing activities during 2014 used cash of 2066 million 1910 million of cash was used for payments on longterm debt related to the convertible note and a loan in japan and 374 million was used for dividend payments partially offset by 213 million provided by the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans and 05 million from the tax benefit related to stock options and restricted stock units 

in 2013 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses acquired used cash of 496 million this was due to a 310 million increase in operating assets and an 186 million decrease in operating liabilities 

the increase in operating assets was due to a 496 million increase in prepayments due primarily to prepayments to our contract manufacturers and a 37 million increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a 223 million decrease in inventories 

  

the decrease in operating liabilities was due to a 25 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments a 289 million decrease in customer advance payments and deferred revenue and 55 million of retirement plan contributions partially offset by a 139 million increase in other accrued liabilities a 37 million increase in accounts payable due to higher fourth quarter sales volume and a 07 million increase in income taxes 

investing activities during 2013 used cash of 2833 million in october 2013 we completed the acquisition of ztec for an initial cash purchase price net of cash acquired of 150 million purchases of property plant and equipment were 1067 million purchases of marketable securities used cash of 11705 million partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities that provided cash of 5165 million and 4585 million respectively the sale of an equity investment provided cash of 342 million purchases of life insurance policies used cash of 03 million 

financing activities during 2013 provided cash of 173 million 176 million was from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans and 27 million from the tax benefit related to stock options and restricted stock units partially offset by 04 million of cash used for payments related to litepoint acquisition contingent consideration and 25 million of cash used for payments on longterm debt related to a loan in japan 

in january 2015 may 2015 august 2015 and november 2015 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006 per share total dividend payments in 2015 were 507 million 

in january 2014 our board of directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share in each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2014 we paid a cash dividend of 006 per share total dividend payments in 2014 were 374 million 

in january 2016 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006 per share to be paid on march 21 2016 to shareholders of record as of february 26 2016 payment of future cash dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition 

in january 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of common stock as of december 31 2015 we repurchased 156 million shares of common stock at an average price of 1920 for a total cost of 3000 million in 2016 we intend to repurchase between 100 million and 200 million of common stock 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in the us and our operations in the us provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities in the us we have approximately 588 million of cash outside the us that if repatriated would incur additional taxes determination of the additional taxes that would be incurred is not practicable due to uncertainty regarding the remittance structure the mix of earnings and earnings and profit pools in the year of remittance and overall complexity of the calculation inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

asc 71520 “compensation – retirement benefits – defined benefit plans” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

  

our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 213 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the largest portion of our 2015 pension expense was 105 million for our us plan pension expense or income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expenseincome and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future in the fourth quarter of 2014 we updated the mortality assumptions related to our us retirement plans using the mortality tables published in october 2014 by the us society of actuaries the change in the mortality assumptions resulted in approximately 390 million of actuarial losses in 2014 for the us retirement plans 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 48 was an appropriate rate to use for 2015 the december 31 2015 asset allocation for our us plan was 89 invested in fixed income securities 10 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations 

we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 40 at december 31 2015 up from 37 at december 31 2014 we estimate that in 2016 we will recognize approximately 05 million of pension income for the us plan the us plan pension income estimate for 2016 is based on a 40 discount rate and a 48 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

as of december 31 2015 our pension plans had unrecognized pension prior service cost of 02 million 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential us plan income expense for the year ending december 31 2016 which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2016 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

 

 the assets of the us plan consist substantially of fixed income securities us plan assets have decreased from 3161 million at december 31 2014 to 2984 million at december 31 2015 while the us plan’s liability decreased from 3130 million at december 31 2014 to 2978 million at december 31 2015 

  

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2015 we made contributions of 80 million to the us plan 25 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 08 million to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries we expect to contribute approximately 26 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan in 2016 contributions to be made in 2016 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately 08 million we do not expect to make any contributions to the us plan in 2016 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note n “stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21 2013 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 320 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 304 million shares issuable thereunder 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2015 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

      

  the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2015 was 10913160 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 12 2025 

as of december 31 2015 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units and options was 449 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 23 years

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in november 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 201517 “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  ” asu 201517 is aimed at reducing complexity in accounting standards currently gaap requires the deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability this requires a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction analysis based on the classification of the assets and liabilities to which the underlying temporary differences relate or in the case of loss or credit carryforwards based on the period in which the attribute is expected to be realized any valuation allowance is then required to be allocated on a pro rata basis by jurisdiction between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets to simplify presentation the new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities along with any related valuation allowance be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet as a result each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability the guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction companies are still prohibited from offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction the new guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within those years early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the guidance may be applied either prospectively for all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively by reclassifying the comparative balance sheet we will early adopt this asu prospectively in january 2016 this asu is expected to have no impact on our results of operations 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 “ business combinations topic 805—simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” asu 201516 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are identified including the cumulative effect of the change in provisional amount as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date asu 201516 is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 and is applied prospectively early adoption is permitted we early adopted this asu in the three months ended october 4 2015 adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 “simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs” which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability consistent with the presentation for debt discount asu 201503 does not specifically address requirements for the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements on august 8 2015 the fasb issued asu 201515 “interest—imputation of interest subtopic 83530” clarifying that debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements could be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement for teradyne the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those years this asu is expected to have no impact on our financial position and results of operations 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which will replace numerous requirements in us gaap including industryspecific requirements and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers the core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to show the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services in august 2015 fasb issued asu 201514 which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by 1 year for teradyne the standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2018 early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date that is annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 the two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented or the modified retrospective method in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application we have not yet selected a transition method we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable one customer accounted for more than 10 of our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2015 a different customer accounted for more than 10 of our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2014 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in japanese yen british pound korean won taiwan dollar singapore dollar and euro these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the netherlands united states and singapore related to shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in the fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2015 and 2014

summary of revenues by reportable segment 

our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues for each of the last three years 

 

 sales and distribution 

in 2014 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2013 and 2012 revenues from apple inc accounted for 12 and 10 respectively of our consolidated revenues apple inc is a customer of our semiconductor test and wireless test segments in each of the years 2014 2013 and 2012 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 21 26 and 29 of our consolidated revenues respectively osat customers often purchase our test systems based upon recommendations from idms and fabless companies in all cases when an osat customer purchases a test system from us we consider the osat as the customer since credit risk title and risk of loss among other things are between teradyne and the osat 

direct sales to united states government agencies accounted for 2 3 and 2 of our consolidated revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively approximately 20 32 and 15 of system test’s revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively were to united states government agencies and 23 24 and 20 of system test’s revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively were to government contractor customers 

we have sales and service offices located throughout north america asia and europe as our customers outside the united states are located primarily in these geographic areas we sell in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force our manufacturing activities are primarily conducted through subcontractors and outsourced contract manufacturers with a significant operation concentrated in china 

  

sales to customers outside the united states were 87 84 and 86 of our consolidated revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site 

sales to customers by country outside of the united states that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in any of the previous three years were as follows 

 

 see also “item 1a risk factors” and note q “operating segment geographic and significant customer information” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments competitors in the semiconductor test segment include among others advantest corporation and xcerra corporation competitors in the system test segment include among others keysight technologies inc formerly agilent technologies astronics test research inc and spea spa 

competitors in our wireless test segment include among others keysight technologies inc cobhamaeroflex inc anritsu company national instruments corporation and rohde  schwarz gmbh  co kg 

some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2014 and 2013 our backlog of unfilled orders in our three reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2014 approximately 97 of the semiconductor test backlog 66 of wireless test backlog and 97 of system test backlog is expected to be delivered in 2015 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without advanced notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers some of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 3900 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances we have no collective bargaining contracts 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 our engineering and development expenditures were 2916 million 2641 million and 2559 million respectively these expenditures accounted for approximately 177 185 and 154 of our consolidated revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

  

our executive officers 

pursuant to general instruction g3 of form 10k the following table is included in part i of this annual report on form 10k in lieu of being included in the proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders the table sets forth the names of all of our executive officers and certain other information relating to their positions held with teradyne and other business experience our executive officers do not have a specific term of office but rather serve at the discretion of the board of directors

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by global and industryspecific economic cycles which are difficult to predict and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries these cycles have resulted in periods of oversupply a trend we believe will continue to occur for newer generations of electronic products our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable increased risk of restructuring charges and 

  

higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues which in each case and together adversely affect our operating results we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including implementing cost control and reduction measures if our businesses experience further downturns whether due to a deterioration in global economic conditions or slowdowns in specific markets we serve we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or marketspecific disruptions that might affect our test businesses 

in 2013 revenues from our storage test business unit were significantly lower than in 2012 due to lower hard disk drive demand from lower shipments of personal computers in response to this lower demand during the third quarter of 2013 we implemented a headcount reduction in the storage test business unit it is possible that we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures including reducing the number of employees and reducing manufacturing capacity a prolonged slowdown in hard disk drive demand may result in increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2014 2013 and 2012 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 21 26 and 29 of consolidated revenues respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to realize the estimated sales value of equipment leased to our customers may adversely affect our results of operations 

we occasionally lease equipment to our customers typically for a term of one year subsequent to the one year term the customer can cancel the lease by providing us two months notice in 2014 the volume of leasing transactions and the value of equipment under leases increased significantly the cost of the leased equipment is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet and depreciated over an estimated useful life of approximately four years realization of the leased equipment’s value depends on numerous factors including the technological 

  

obsolescence of the leased equipment elections by customers to terminate a lease prior to scheduled termination the general market conditions at the time of expiration of the lease the customer’s election to renew the lease and the cost of comparable new equipment our inability to realize the leased equipment’s value could cause a decrease in revenues and an increase in asset writeoffs which would in each case reduce our operating income 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors could impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan china singapore and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 25 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

  

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform  

we depend on flextronics international ltd “flextronics” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

we may acquire businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenues or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our 

  

manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2014 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative regulatory or governmental proceedings including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results or cash flows 

  

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in singapore we operate under a tax holiday which is effective through december 31 2015 the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 132 million or 006 per diluted share 47 million or 002 per diluted share and 109 million or 005 per diluted share respectively we are in discussions with the singapore economic development board with respect to extension of the tax holiday for periods after december 31 2015 no assurances can be given that such discussions will be successful if we are unable to reach an agreement with the singapore economic development board our results of operations and financial condition for periods after december 31 2015 will be adversely affected 

in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to obtain or maintain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note j “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program 

in january 2014 our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend of 006 per share in january 2015 our board of directors authorized teradyne to repurchase up to 500 million of common stock 300 million of which we intend to repurchase in 2015 holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties this requirement could affect the pricing sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products in addition there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all minerals used in our products as a result we may be unable to certify that our products are conflict free 

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

we rely on various information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including confidential data and to carry out and support a variety of business activities including manufacturing research and development supply chain management sales and accounting a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our suppliers and other service providers including as a result of cyber attacks could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs 

  

we may face risks associated with shareholder activism 

publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or divestitures we may become subject in the future to such shareholder activity and demands such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price 

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automatic test equipment we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test semiconductors wireless products hard disk drives solid state disks and circuit boards in the consumer electronics wireless automotive industrial computing communications and aerospace and defense industries our automatic test equipment products and services include 

 

   

  

 we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers “osats” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics manufacturers of circuit boards automotive suppliers wireless product manufacturers storage device manufacturers aerospace and military contractors 

in 2014 we acquired avionics interface technologies llc “ait” a supplier of equipment for testing stateoftheart data communication buses the acquisition of ait complements our defenseaerospace line of bus test instrumentation for commercial and defense avionics systems ait is included in our system test segment 

in 2013 we acquired ztec instruments inc “ztec” a supplier of modular wireless test instruments the acquisition of ztec expands our wireless test segment into the design verification test of wireless components and chipsets 

we believe our recent acquisitions have enhanced our opportunities for growth we will continue to invest in our business grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations the sharp swings in the semiconductor and electronics industries in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor and electronics test equipment and services industries more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

in 2013 revenues from our storage test business unit were significantly lower than in 2012 due to lower hard disk drive demand from lower shipments of personal computers in response to this lower demand during the third quarter of 2013 we implemented a headcount reduction in the storage test business unit it is possible that we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures including reducing the number of employees and reducing manufacturing capacity a prolonged slowdown in storage test demand may result in increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

  

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 

our equipment has nonsoftware and embedded software components that function together to deliver the equipment’s essential functionality revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “besp” for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 

our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customers’ ability to use the product we defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 60520 “separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts” and asc 60525 “revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements” service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed 

our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues 

we do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

retirement and postretirement plans 

effective january 1 2012 we changed the method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plan and calculating the expected return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans historically we recognized net actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet on an annual basis and amortized them into operating results over the average remaining years of service of the plan participants to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a range “corridor” in 2012 we elected to immediately recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans in addition we used to calculate the expected return on plan assets using a calculated marketrelated value of plan assets effective january 1 2012 we elected to calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets 

we believe that this new method is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses in our operating results and it will improve the transparency by faster recognition of the effects of economic and 

  

interest rate trends on plan obligations and investments these actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly will be recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 250 “accounting changes and error corrections”  all prior periods presented in this annual report on form 10k have been adjusted to apply the new accounting method retrospectively 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 “ compensation—stock compensation ” as required by asc 718 we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740 “accounting for income taxes” this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities estimates of projected future taxable income and taxplanning strategies although realization is not assured based on our assessment we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets net of the existing valuation allowance will be realized us income taxes are not provided for on the earnings of nonus subsidiaries which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the us for intraperiod tax allocations we first utilize nonequity related tax attributes such as net operating losses and credit carryforwards and then equityrelated tax attributes we use the withandwithout method for calculating excess stock compensation deductions and do not take into account any indirect impacts of excess stock compensation deductions on its research and development tax credits domestic production activities deduction and other differences between financial reporting and tax reporting 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

   

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that excess in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques 

we assess the impairment of intangible and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 

as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 described above we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segment’s intangible and longlived assets based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets and there was no indication of impairment when we determine that the carrying value of intangible and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks

book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows 

 

   

revenues 

revenues for our three reportable segments were as follows 

 

 the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 2778 million or 27 from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher systemonachip “soc” product volume driven by a larger application processor test market driven by market demand 

the decrease in semiconductor test revenues of 1047 million or 9 from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in soc test product sales because of a smaller application processor test market partially offset by higher memory system sales 

the decrease in wireless test revenues of 674 million or 27 from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to lower cellular and connectivity product volume 

the decrease in wireless test revenues of 345 million or 12 from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower connectivity product volume partially offset by higher cellular product volume 

the increase in system test revenues of 95 million or 6 from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher product volume in storage test and production board test partially offset by lower defenseaerospace product sales 

the decrease in system test revenues of 897 million or 37 from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower product volume in storage test the decrease in storage test sales was due to lower hard disk drive demand primarily from lower shipments of personal computers 

our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues for each of the last three years 

 

   

revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 1 

 

  

 the breakout of product and service revenues for the past three years was as follows 

 

 our product revenues increased 2091 million or 18 in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in soc test product volume driven by a larger application processor test market driven by market demand this increase was partially offset by lower cellular and connectivity product volume in wireless test service revenues which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes equipment maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 108 million or 4 

our product revenues decreased 2287 million or 17 in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to a decrease in soc test product sales because of a smaller application processor test market and due to lower product volume in storage test 

in 2014 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2013 and 2012 revenues from one customer accounted for 12 and 10 respectively of our consolidated revenues in each of the years 2014 2013 and 2012 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 21 26 and 29 respectively of our consolidated revenues 

gross profit 

 

   

gross profit as a percent of total revenues decreased from 2013 to 2014 by 33 points this decrease was a result of a decrease of 28 points related to unfavorable product mix in soc semiconductor test and lower wireless test sales and a decrease of 11 points due to pension expense in 2014 compared to pension income in 2013 partially offset by an increase of 11 points due to higher sales volume 

gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased from 2012 to 2013 by 31 points this increase was a result of an increase of 17 points related to favorable product mix in soc semiconductor test and lower storage test system sales compared to 2012 an increase of 11 points due to pension income in 2013 compared to pension expense in 2012 an increase of 11 points due to lower excess and obsolete inventory provisions and increased sales of previously reserved inventory and an increase of 04 points as a result of no purchase accounting inventory stepup in 2013 partially offset by a decrease of 14 points due to lower sales volume across all segments 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future product demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test and system test segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded an inventory provision of 222 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

 during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded an inventory provision of 166 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded an inventory provision of 268 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we scrapped 208 million 353 million and 96 million of inventory respectively and sold 129 million 98 million and 43 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2014 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1113 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 275 million from 2013 to 2014 was due primarily to 122 million of pension expense in 2014 compared to 44 million of pension income in 2013 a 109 million increase in semiconductor test spending 27 million of higher variable compensation and 26 million of increased spending in wireless test partially offset by lower system test spending 

the increase of 82 million in engineering and development expenses from 2012 to 2013 was due primarily to a 217 million increase in semiconductor test spending partially offset by 44 million of pension income in 2013 compared to 75 million of pension expense in 2012 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 401 million from 2013 to 2014 was due primarily to 216 million of pension expense in 2014 compared to 29 million of pension income in 2013 a onetime 66 million stockbased compensation charge in 2014 related to a retirement agreement entered into with our retired chief executive officer and increased spending in semiconductor test and corporate 

the increase of 26 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2012 to 2013 was due primarily to a 70 million increase in wireless test spending a 54 million increase in semiconductor test spending partially offset by 29 million of pension income in 2013 compared to 68 million of pension expense in 2012 

  

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2013 to 2014 due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the year partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the ait acquisition acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2012 to 2013 due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the year partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the ztec acquisition 

goodwill impairment 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 989 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment price competition and different testing techniques further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

restructuring and other 

restructuring 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded 16 million of charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 43 people primarily in semiconductor test and wireless test 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded 19 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 48 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test and a 04 million credit in corporate related to a change in the estimated exit costs related to a leased facility 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded 10 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 19 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test 

the remaining accrual for severance of 04 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by june 2015 

other 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded a 06 million gain from the fair value adjustment to decrease the ztec acquisition contingent consideration partially offset by 04 million of acquisition costs related to ait 

during the year ended december 31 2012 due to a decrease in specified new product revenue through the december 31 2012 earnout period end date we recorded an 88 million gain from the fair value adjustment to decrease the litepoint acquisition contingent consideration 

  

interest and other 

 

 interest income increased by 22 million from 41 million in 2013 to 63 million in 2014 due primarily to higher cash and marketable securities balances in 2014 

interest expense decreased by 192 million from 261 million in 2013 to 69 million in 2014 due primarily to a repayment of our convertible debt in the first quarter of 2014 in 2013 and 2012 interest expense included convertible debt discount amortization 

in 2013 other income expense net included a 342 million gain from the sale of an equity investment 

income loss before income taxes 

 

  

 the decrease in income before income taxes from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to a 989 million goodwill impairment charge related to wireless test and 466 million pension expense related to actuarial losses in 2014 partially offset by higher income due to higher revenues in semiconductor test in 2014 

the decrease in income before income taxes from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 a 98 million increase in restructuring and other costs partially offset by a 342 million gain from the sale of an equity investment in 2013 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2014 2013 and 2012 totaled 141 million 370 million and 489 million respectively the effective tax rate for 2014 2013 and 2012 was 148 183 and 184 respectively the decrease in income tax expense from 2013 to 2014 was primarily attributable to a shift in the geographic distribution of income which decreased income subject to taxation in the united states relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by an increase in income tax expense associated with uncertain tax positions and a reduction in the benefit from us research and development tax credits 

the decrease in income tax expense from 2012 to 2013 was due to the reinstatement of the us research and development tax credit in 2013 for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 and lower pretax income partially offset by higher tax expense for uncertain tax positions and state taxes 

  

us research and development tax credits provided a 79 and 72 reduction to the 2014 and 2013 us statutory federal tax rate of 350 respectively the research and development tax credit expired at the end of 2014 therefore if the credit is not reenacted there could be an unfavorable impact on our 2015 effective income tax rate 

we operate under a tax holiday in singapore which is effective through december 31 2015 the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 132 million or 006 per diluted share 47 million or 002 per diluted share and 109 million or 005 per diluted share respectively we are in discussions with the singapore economic development board with respect to extension of the tax holiday for periods after december 31 2015 

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 

 

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased 992 million to 13 billion from 2013 to 2014 cash activity for 2014 2013 and 2012 was as follows 

 

 in 2014 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses acquired provided cash of 524 million this was due to a 1008 million decrease in operating assets and a 484 million decrease in operating liabilities 

  

the decrease in operating assets was due to a 415 million decrease in prepayments and other assets primarily related to a reduction in prepayments to our contract manufacturers a 512 million decrease in inventories due to higher sales and an 81 million decrease in accounts receivable 

the decrease in operating liabilities was due to 339 million of retirement plan contributions a 170 million decrease in other accrued liabilities a 169 million decrease in accounts payable a 73 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments a 43 million convertible note interest payment partially offset by a 220 million increase in customer advance payments and deferred revenue and an 89 million increase in accrued income taxes 

investing activities during 2014 used cash of 3329 million due to 15787 million used for purchases of marketable securities and 1690 million used for purchases of property plant and equipment and 194 million used for the acquisition of ait completed in october 2014 partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 8597 million and 5704 million respectively and net proceeds from life insurance of 42 million primarily related to the cash surrender value from the cancellation of teradyne owned life insurance policies on its retired chief executive officer the increase in purchase of property plant and equipment of 623 million in 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily due to testers used for customer leases 

financing activities during 2014 used cash of 2066 million 1910 million of cash was used for payments on longterm debt related to the convertible note and a loan in japan and 374 million was used for dividend payments partially offset by 213 million provided by the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans and 05 million from the tax benefit related to stock options and restricted stock units 

in 2013 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired used cash of 497 million this was due to a 321 million increase in operating assets and a 177 million decrease in operating liabilities 

the increase in operating assets was due to a 496 million increase in prepayments due primarily to prepayments to our contract manufacturers and a 37 million increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a 212 million decrease in inventories 

the decrease in operating liabilities was due to a 25 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments a 289 million decrease in customer advance payments and deferred revenue and 55 million of retirement plan contributions partially offset by a 139 million increase in other accrued liabilities a 37 million increase in accounts payable due to higher fourth quarter sales volume and a 16 million increase in accrued income taxes 

investing activities during 2013 used cash of 2833 million in october 2013 we completed the acquisition of ztec for an initial cash purchase price net of cash acquired of 150 million purchases of property plant and equipment were 1067 million purchases of marketable securities used cash of 11705 million partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities that provided cash of 5165 million and 4585 million respectively the sale of an equity investment provided cash of 342 million purchases of life insurance policies used cash of 03 million 

financing activities during 2013 provided cash of 173 million 176 million was from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans and 27 million from the tax benefit related to stock options and restricted stock units partially offset by 04 million of cash used for payments related to litepoint acquisition contingent consideration and 25 million of cash used for payments on longterm debt related to a loan in japan 

  

in 2012 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired used cash of 418 million this was due to a 94 million increase in operating assets and a 324 million decrease in operating liabilities 

the increase in operating assets was due to a 241 million increase in accounts receivable and a 30 million increase in prepayments due primarily to supplier prepayments partially offset by a 177 million decrease in inventories 

the decrease in operating liabilities was due to a 157 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments a 146 million decrease in customer advance payments and deferred revenue a 115 million decrease in accounts payable due to lower fourth quarter sales volume a 56 million decrease in other accrued liabilities and 48 million of retirement plan contributions partially offset by a 198 million increase in accrued income taxes 

investing activities during 2012 used cash of 6025 million due to 7482 million used for purchases of marketable securities and 1191 million used for purchases of property plant and equipment partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 383 million and 2251 million respectively and proceeds of 15 million from life insurance policies 

financing activities during 2012 used cash of 353 million 185 million was from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans and 85 million from the tax benefit related to stock options and restricted stock units partially offset by 597 million of cash used for payments related to litepoint acquisition contingent consideration and 25 million of cash used for payments on longterm debt related to a loan in japan 

in january 2014 our board of directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share in each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2014 we paid a cash dividend of 006 per share in january 2015 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006 per share to be paid on march 24 2015 to shareholders of record as of february 27 2015 total dividend payments in 2014 were 374 million payment of future cash dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition 

in january 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of common stock 300 million of which we intend to repurchase in 2015 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in the us and our operations in the us provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities in the us we have approximately 616 million of cash outside the us that if repatriated would incur additional taxes determination of the additional taxes that would be incurred is not practicable due to uncertainty regarding the remittance structure the mix of earnings and earnings and profit pools in the year of remittance and overall complexity of the calculation inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

asc 71520 “compensation – retirement benefits – defined benefit plans” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

  

our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 524 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the largest portion of our 2014 pension expense was 312 million for our us plan pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expenseincome and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future in the fourth quarter of 2014 we updated the mortality assumptions related to our us retirement plans using the mortality tables published in october 2014 by the us society of actuaries the change in the mortality assumptions resulted in approximately 390 million of actuarial losses in 2014 for the us retirement plans 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment managers and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 50 was an appropriate rate to use for 2014 the december 31 2014 asset allocation for our us plan was 83 invested in fixed income securities 16 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 

effective january 1 2012 we elected to immediately recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans in addition we used to calculate the expected return on plan assets using a calculated marketrelated value of plan assets effective january 1 2012 we elected to calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 37 at december 31 2014 down from 45 at december 31 2013 we estimate that in 2015 we will recognize approximately 15 million of pension income for the us plan the us plan pension income estimate for 2015 is based on a 37 discount rate and 475 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

as of december 31 2014 our pension plans had unrecognized pension prior service cost of 04 million 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential us plan income expense for the year ending december 31 2015 which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2015 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

 

 the assets of the us plan consist substantially of fixed income securities us plan assets have increased from 2564 million at december 31 2013 to 3161 million at december 31 2014 

  

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2014 we made contributions of 300 million to the us plan 18 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 12 million to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries we expect to contribute approximately 25 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan in 2015 contributions that will be made in 2015 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately 10 million we do not expect to make any contributions to the us plan in 2015 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note n “stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21 2013 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 320 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 304 million shares issuable thereunder 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2014 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

      

 the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2014 was 12443022 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 24 2016 

as of december 31 2014 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units and options was 513 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 years

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which will replace numerous requirements in us gaap including industryspecific requirements and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers the core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to show the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be 

  

entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period for teradyne the standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2017 the two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented or the modified retrospective method in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application we have not yet selected a transition method we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in japanese yen british pound korean won taiwan dollar and euro these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2014 and 2013

 see also “item 1a risk factors” and note r “operating segment geographic and significant customer information” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments competitors in the semiconductor test segment include among others advantest corporation and ltx–credence corporation competitors in the system test segment include among others agilent technologies inc and xyratex ltd which announced on december 23 2013 that it has agreed to be acquired by seagate technology plc 

  

competitors in our wireless test segment include among others agilent technologies inc aeroflex inc anritsu company national instruments corporation and rohde  schwarz gmbh  co kg 

some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products in particular our largest competitor in the semiconductor test segment spends considerably more than us on research and development which may provide it with a competitive advantage we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 our backlog of unfilled orders in our three reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2013 approximately 98 of the semiconductor test backlog 94 of system test backlog and 65 of wireless test backlog is expected to be delivered in 2014 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers some of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 3800 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances we have no collective bargaining contracts 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 2641 million 2559 million and 2010 million respectively these expenditures accounted for approximately 185 154 and 141 of our consolidated net revenues in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by global and industryspecific economic cycles which are difficult to predict and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries these cycles have resulted in periods of oversupply a trend we believe will continue to occur for newer generations of electronic products our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable increased risk of restructuring charges and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues which in each case and together adversely affect our operating results we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial 

  

markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality including implementing cost control and reduction measures if our businesses experience further downturns whether due to a deterioration in global economic conditions or slowdowns in specific markets we serve we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or marketspecific disruptions that might affect our test businesses 

in 2013 revenue from our storage test business unit was significantly lower than 2012 due to lower hard disk drive demand from lower shipments of personal computers a trend which is expected to continue in response to this lower demand during the third quarter of 2013 we implemented a headcount reduction in the storage test business unit it is possible that we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures including reducing the number of employees and reducing manufacturing capacity a prolonged slowdown in hard disk drive demand may result in increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products in particular our largest competitor in the semiconductor test segment spends considerably more than us on research and development which may provide it with a competitive advantage we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2013 2012 and 2011 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 26 29 and 19 of consolidated net revenues respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated net revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to realize the estimated sales value of equipment leased to our customers may adversely affect our results of operations 

we occasionally lease equipment to our customers typically for a term of one year we expect that the volume of leasing transactions and the value of equipment under leases to significantly increase in the near term in connection with these equipment leases the cost of the equipment is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet and depreciated over an estimated useful life of four years realization of the leased equipment’s value depends on numerous factors including the technological obsolescence of the leased equipment the general market 

  

conditions at the time of expiration of the lease the customer’s election to renew the lease and the cost of comparable new equipment our inability to realize the leased equipment’s value could cause a decrease in revenue and an increase in asset writeoffs which would in each case reduce our operating income 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors could impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 25 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform  

we depend on flextronics international ltd “flextronics” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

we may acquire businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenues or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

the value of our common stock may be impacted by settlement of our convertible notes and exercise of the warrants issued to the convertible note hedge counterparty 

upon maturity on march 15 2014 of our 450 convertible senior notes the “notes” the notes will be “net share settled” meaning that holders will receive for each 1000 in principal amount of notes 1000 in cash and a number of shares of our common stock equal to 18265 subject to antidilution adjustment under certain circumstances less a number of shares having 1000 of value as determined based on the average trading price of our common stock over a 25day trading period from february 5 2014 to march 12 2014 we intend to satisfy this obligation through use of cash and by exercise of our call option agreement we entered into with goldman sachs  co the “hedge counterparty” at the time of issuance of the notes the hedge counterparty will subsequently be able to exercise warrants with a strike price of 767 an amount 75 higher than the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 these warrants will be net share settled with approximately 534000 warrants settled on a daily basis over a 65day trading period from june 17 2014 to september 17 2014 however we are not obligated to issue more than 34526500 shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants which amount represented less than 1999 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of march 31 2009 without giving effect to any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrant transaction while the convertible note hedge is expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon settlement of the notes the warrant transaction will separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the 

  

market value per share of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants which could impact the value of our stock the value of our stock may be further impacted by actions of the hedge counterparty including derivative transactions it may have entered into with respect to our common stock purchases it may have made of shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes the settlement of these derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2013 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the 

  

intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results and cash flows 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by our failure to expand operations or earnings in certain countries the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to obtain or maintain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note k “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend 

in january 2014 our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend program and declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share to be paid on june 2 2014 to shareholders of record as of may 9 2014 holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors payment of future cash dividends will rest within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend in the future the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties this new requirement could affect the pricing sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products in addition there will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products as a result we may be unable to certify that our products are conflict free 

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our suppliers and other service providers including as a result of cyber attacks could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information damage our reputation cause losses and increase our costs 

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automatic test equipment we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test semiconductors wireless products hard disk drives and circuit boards in the consumer electronics wireless automotive industrial computing communications and aerospace and defense industries our automatic test equipment products and services include 

 

   

  

 we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers “osats” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics manufacturers of circuit boards automotive suppliers wireless product manufacturers storage device manufacturers aerospace and military contractors 

in 2013 we acquired ztec instruments inc “ztec” a supplier of modular wireless test instruments the acquisition of ztec expands our wireless test segment into the design verification test of wireless components and chipsets 

in 2011 we acquired litepoint corporation “litepoint” to expand our product portfolio of test equipment in the wireless test sector litepoint designs develops and supports advanced wireless test solutions for the development and manufacturing of wireless devices including smart phones tablets notebooks laptops personal computer peripherals and other wifi bluetooth and cellular enabled devices litepoint and ztec represent our wireless test segment 

we believe our acquisitions of litepoint and ztec have enhanced our opportunities for growth we will continue to invest in our business to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations the sharp swings in the semiconductor and electronics industries in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor and electronics test equipment and services industries more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 

in 2013 revenue from our storage test business unit was significantly lower than 2012 due to lower hard disk drive demand from lower shipments of personal computers a trend which is expected to continue in response to this lower demand during the third quarter of 2013 we implemented a headcount reduction in the storage test business unit it is possible that we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures including reducing the number of employees and reducing manufacturing capacity a prolonged slowdown in hard disk drive demand may result in increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories asset writeoffs and restructuring charges 

on march 21 2011 we completed the sale of our diagnostic solutions business unit which was included in the system test segment to spx corporation for 402 million in cash we sold this business as its growth potential as a standalone business was significantly less than if it was part of a larger automotive supplier the financial information for diagnostic solutions has been reclassified to discontinued operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

  

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 

our equipment has nonsoftware and embedded software components that function together to deliver the equipment’s essential functionality revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “besp” for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 

our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customers’ ability to use the product we defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 60520 “separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts” and asc 60525 “revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements” service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed 

our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 

we do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

retirement and postretirement plans 

effective january 1 2012 we changed the method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plan and calculating the expected return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans historically we recognized net actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortized them into operating results over the average remaining years of service of the plan participants to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a range “corridor” we elected to immediately recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans in addition we used to calculate the expected return on plan assets using a calculated marketrelated value of plan assets effective january 1 2012 we elected to calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets 

we believe that this new method is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses in our operating results and it will improve the transparency by faster recognition of the effects of economic and 

  

interest rate trends on plan obligations and investments these actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly will be recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 250 accounting changes and error corrections all prior periods presented in this annual report on form 10k have been adjusted to apply the new accounting method retrospectively 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 “ compensation—stock compensation ” as required by asc 718 we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance we consider the probability of future taxable income and our historical profitability among other factors in assessing the amount of the realizability of our deferred tax assets as a result of this review undertaken at december 31 2002 we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions most notably the united states at december 31 2011 we reassessed this judgment and concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized through consideration of both the positive and negative evidence the evidence consisted primarily of our three year us historical cumulative profitability projected future taxable income forecasted utilization of the deferred tax assets and the fourth quarter of 2011 acquisition of litepoint offset by the volatility of the industries we operate in primarily the semiconductor industry as such we reduced the valuation allowance by 1902 million which was recorded as a tax benefit in the year ended december 31 2011 at december 31 2013 and 2012 we maintained a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of 404 million and 554 million respectively primarily related to state net operating losses and state tax credit carryforwards due to uncertainty regarding their realization adjustments could be required in the future if we estimate that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount we have recorded 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted which retrospectively reinstated the research and development tax credit for 2012 and extended it through december 31 2013 as a result in the first quarter of 2013 we recorded a discrete benefit related to 2012 us federal research and development tax credit of approximately 67 million 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

   

  

 goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess the impairment of intangible and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends there were no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable in 2013 2012 or 2011 when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter as of december 31 on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess no goodwill impairment was identified in 2013 2012 or 2011

book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows 

 

   

revenues 

net revenues for our three reportable segments were as follows 

 

 the decrease in semiconductor test revenues of 1047 million or approximately 9 from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in systemonachip “soc” test product sales because of a lower application processor market which is a key sector of the mobility applications market in 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by higher memory system sales 

the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 215 million or approximately 2 from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in soc test product sales for mobility applications partially offset by a decrease in memory system sales 

the decrease in wireless test revenues of 345 million or approximately 12 from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower connectivity volume partially offset by higher cellular volume 

the acquisition of ztec which was completed in october of 2013 added 04 million of revenues in 2013 the acquisition of litepoint which was completed in october of 2011 added 2864 million and 284 million of revenues in 2012 and 2011 respectively litepoint and ztec represent our wireless test segment 

the decrease in system test revenues of 897 million or approximately 37 from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower product volume in storage test systems the decrease in storage test system sales was due to lower hard disk drive demand primarily from lower shipments of personal computers a trend which is expected to continue 

the decrease in system test revenues of 518 million or approximately 18 from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to lower product volume in both storage test systems and commercial board test systems partially offset by an increase in milaero system and instrument sales 

our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenues for each of the last three years 

 

   

net revenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 1 

 

  

 the breakout of product and service revenues for the past three years was as follows 

 

 our product revenues decreased 2287 million or 17 in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to a decrease in soc test product sales because of a lower application processor market and due to lower volume in storage test systems 

service revenues which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes equipment maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support decreased 02 million or 01 

our product revenues increased 2234 million or 19 in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to 2546 million of product revenues from the addition of litepoint an increase in soc semiconductor test products for mobility applications and an increase in milaero systems and instruments the increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales in our memory test and storage test systems service revenues increased 43 million or 2 

in 2013 and 2012 revenues from one customer accounted for 12 and 10 respectively of our consolidated net revenues in 2011 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues in each of the years 2013 2012 and 2011 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 26 29 and 19 of our consolidated net revenues respectively 

gross profit 

 

   

gross profit as a percent of revenue increased from 2012 to 2013 by 31 percentage points this increase was a result of an increase of 17 points related to a favorable product mix in soc semiconductor test and lower storage test system sales compared to 2012 an increase of 11 points due to pension income in 2013 compared to pension expense in 2012 an increase of 11 points due to lower excess and obsolete inventory provisions and increased sales of previously reserved inventory and an increase of 04 points as a result of no purchase accounting inventory stepup in 2013 partially offset by a decrease of 14 points due to lower sales volume across all segments 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased from 2011 to 2012 by 37 percentage points this increase was a result of an increase of 46 points primarily due to the addition of litepoint partially offset by a decrease of 12 points due to higher inventory provisions 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future product demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded an inventory provision of 166 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

 during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded an inventory provision of 268 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded an inventory provision of 116 million included in cost of revenues due to the downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of the 116 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2011 104 million was related to semiconductor test primarily due to product transition 11 million was in system test and 01 million was in wireless test 

  

during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we scrapped 353 million 96 million and 92 million of inventory respectively and sold 98 million 43 million and 81 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2013 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1159 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 82 million in engineering and development expenses from 2012 to 2013 was due primarily to increased spending in semiconductor test and wireless test partially offset by pension income in 2013 compared to pension expense in 2012 and lower variable compensation in 2013 

the increase of 549 million in engineering and development expenses from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to additional costs of 371 million related to litepoint and increased spending in semiconductor test 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 26 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2012 to 2013 was due primarily to increased sales and marketing spending in semiconductor test and wireless test partially offset by pension income in 2013 compared to pension expense in 2012 

the increase of 449 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to additional costs of 497 million related to litepoint 

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2012 to 2013 due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the year partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the ztec acquisition the increase of 330 million from 2011 to 2012 was due to the litepoint acquisition 

  

restructuring and other 

restructuring 

the remaining accrual for severance and benefits of 05 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by june 2014 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded 19 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 48 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test and a 04 million credit in corporate related to a change in the estimated exit costs related to a leased facility 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded 10 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 19 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 12 million of charges related to headcount reductions of 7 people in semiconductor test and a 05 million credit primarily in system test related to a change in the estimated exit costs related to leased facilities 

other 

during the year ended december 31 2012 due to a decrease in specified new product revenue through the december 31 2012 earnout period end date we recorded an 88 million fair value adjustment to decrease the litepoint acquisition contingent consideration 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 58 million of other charges of which 46 million related to litepoint acquisition costs and 12 million related to nonus pension settlements 

interest and other 

 

 interest income decreased by 25 million from 66 million in 2011 to 41 million in 2012 due to a decrease in marketable securities which were used to fund the litepoint acquisition in 2011 

interest expense and other decreased by 326 million from 255 million in net expense in 2012 to 71 million in net other income in 2013 due primarily to a 342 million gain from the sale of an equity investment partially offset by higher interest expense from increased convertible debt discount amortization 

interest expense and other increased by 18 million from 237 million in 2011 to 255 million in 2012 due primarily to higher interest expense from increased convertible debt discount amortization 

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

   

the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower revenue in 2013 compared to 2012 a 98 million increase in restructuring and other costs partially offset by a 342 million gain from the sale of an equity investment 

the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to higher revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 and a 145 million decrease in restructuring and other costs partially offset by a 998 million increase in engineering and development and selling and administrative expenses and a 330 million increase in intangible assets amortization 

income taxes 

the income tax expense from continuing operations for 2013 totaled 370 million compared to 489 million for 2012 the effective tax rate for 2013 and 2012 was approximately 18 the decrease in income tax expense from 2012 to 2013 was due to the reinstatement of the us research and development tax credit in 2013 for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 lower pretax income partially offset by higher tax expense for uncertain tax positions and state taxes us research and development tax credits provided a 72 reduction to the 2013 us statutory federal tax rate of 350 the research and development tax credit expired at the end of 2013 therefore if the credit is not legislatively reenacted there could be an unfavorable impact on teradyne’s 2014 effective income tax rate the income tax benefit from continuing operations for 2011 totaled 1295 million primarily due to the reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance we considered the weight of both the positive and negative evidence as of december 31 2011 and concluded that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets will be realized 

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013

in 2012 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired used cash of 418 million this was due to a 94 million increase in operating assets and a 324 million decrease in operating liabilities 

  

the increase in operating assets was due to a 241 million increase in accounts receivable and a 30 million increase in prepayments due primarily to supplier prepayments partially offset by a 177 million decrease in inventories 

the decrease in operating liabilities was due to a 157 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments a 146 million decrease in customer advance payments and deferred revenue a 115 million decrease in accounts payable due to lower fourth quarter sales volume a 56 million decrease in other accrued liabilities and 48 million of retirement plan contributions partially offset by a 198 million increase in accrued income taxes

financing activities during 2012 used cash of 354 million 185 million was from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans and 84 million from the tax benefit related to stock options and restricted stock units partially offset by 597 million of cash used for payments related to litepoint acquisition contingent consideration and 25 million of cash used for payments on longterm debt related to the japan loan 

in 2011 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired used cash of 929 million this was due to a 442 million decrease in operating assets and a 1371 million decrease in operating liabilities 

the decrease in operating assets was due to a 664 million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from increased collections partially offset by a 215 million increase in prepayments due primarily to supplier prepayments and a 06 million increase in inventories the decrease in operating liabilities was due to a 626 million decrease in customer advance payments due to shipments of systems prepaid by customers a 282 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments a 199 million decrease in accounts payable due to decreased sales volume 119 million of retirement plan contributions an 87 million decrease in accrued income taxes and a 58 million decrease in deferred revenue 

investing activities during 2011 used cash of 1216 million in october 2011 we completed the acquisition of litepoint for an initial cash purchase price net of cash acquired of 5375 million purchases of property plant and equipment were 861 million proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 7468 million and 4421 million respectively partially offset by 6858 million used for purchase of marketable securities purchases of life insurance policies used cash of 11 million the net proceeds were used to acquire litepoint 

financing activities during 2011 used cash of 163 million due to the repurchase of 26 million shares of common stock for 312 million at an average price of 1184 per share and 25 million for payments on longterm debt related to the japan loan partially offset by 174 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans 

on april 6 2009 we completed a registered public offering of 1900 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes “notes” and settled the related convertible bond hedge and warrant transaction and received approximately 1630 million as a result of these financing transactions the notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per annum payable semi annually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year the first interest payment was on september 15 2009 the notes will mature on march 15 2014 unless earlier repurchased by us or converted the notes may be converted under certain circumstances and during certain periods at an initial conversion rate of approximately 18265 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal 

  

amount of notes which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 548 the convertible note hedge and warrant transaction will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the notes to approximately 767 per share of our common stock representing a 75 conversion premium based upon the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity holders of the notes may require us to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving teradyne the notes are convertible during the last three months prior to the march 15 2014 maturity date upon conversion during the last three months prior to the march 15 2014 maturity date the notes will “net share settle” meaning that holders will receive for each 1000 in principal amount of notes 1000 in cash and a number of shares of teradyne common stock equal to 18265 subject to antidilution adjustment under certain circumstances less number of shares having 1000 of value as determined based on the average trading price of the common stock over a 25day trading period from february 5 2014 to march 12 2014 

in january 2014 our board of directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of 006 per share to be paid on june 2 2014 to stockholders of record as of may 9 2014 holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends if and when they are declared by our board of directors payment of future cash dividends will rest within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend among other things upon our earnings capital requirements and financial condition 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in the us and our operations in the us provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities in the us we have approximately 340 million of cash outside the us that if repatriated would incur additional taxes determination of the additional taxes that would be incurred is not practical due to uncertainty regarding the remittance structure the mix of earnings and earnings and profit pools in the year of remittance and overall complexity of the calculation inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

asc 71520 “compensation – retirement benefits – defined benefit plans” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

our pension income which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 60 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the largest portion of our 2013 pension income was 63 million for our us plan pension income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expenseincome and assetliability measurement we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment managers and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 50 was an appropriate rate to use for 2013 the december 31 2013 asset allocation for our us plan was 87 invested in fixed income securities 12 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 

  

effective january 1 2012 we elected to immediately recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans in addition we used to calculate the expected return on plan assets using a calculated marketrelated value of plan assets effective january 1 2012 we elected to calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 45 at december 31 2013 up from 36 at december 31 2012 we estimate that in 2014 we will recognize approximately 01 million of pension cost for the us plan the us plan related pension cost estimate for 2014 is based on a 45 discount rate and 50 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

as of december 31 2013 our pension plans had unrecognized pension prior service cost of 05 million 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential us plan income expense for the year ending december 31 2014 which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2014 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

 

 the assets of the us plan consist substantially of fixed income securities us plan assets have decreased from 2789 million at december 31 2012 to 2564 million at december 31 2013 

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2013 we made contributions of 17 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 25 million to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries we expect to contribute approximately 18 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan in 2014 contributions that will be made in 2014 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately 22 million we do not expect to make any contributions to the us plan in 2014 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note o “stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21 2013 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 320 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 304 million shares issuable thereunder 

  

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2013 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

     the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2013 was 14212944 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 24 2016 

  

as of december 31 2013 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units and options was 513 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 years 

performance graph 

the following graph compares the change in our cumulative total shareholder return in our common stock with i the standard  poor’s 500 index ii the philadelphia semiconductor index and iii the morningstar semiconductor equipment  materials index the comparison assumes 10000 was invested on december 31 2008 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and assumes reinvestment of dividends if any historic stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future price performance this is the last year that we will compare ourselves to the morningstar semiconductor equipment  materials index going forward we will compare ourselves against the philadelphia semiconductor index as this better aligns us with companies in the semiconductor industry 

 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu 201311 “income taxes topic 740 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists” under this asu unrecognized tax benefits will be netted against all available samejurisdiction loss or other tax carryforwards that would be utilized rather than only against carryforwards that are created by unrecognized tax benefits the provisions of this asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2013 teradyne does not expect this asu to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large 

  

number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in japanese yen british pound korean won taiwan dollar and euro these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2013 and 2012

competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments competitors in the semiconductor test segment include among others advantest corporation and ltx–credence corporation competitors in the systems test group include among others agilent technologies inc and xyratex ltd competitors in our wireless test segment include among others agilent technologies inc aeroflex inc anritsu company national instruments corporation and rohde  schwarz gmbh  co kg 

some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products in particular our largest competitor in the semiconductor test segment spends considerably more than us on research and development which may provide it with a competitive advantage we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2012 and 2011 our backlog of unfilled orders in our three reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2012 approximately 98 of the semiconductor test backlog 85 of systems test group backlog and 48 of wireless test backlog is expected to be delivered in 2013 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers some of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products 

  

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 3600 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances we have no collective bargaining contracts 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were 2514 million 1978 million and 1919 million respectively these expenditures accounted for approximately 15 14 and 12 of our consolidated net revenues in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles which are difficult to predict 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies and resulting reductions in customer capital investments the duration and frequency of slowdowns in customer capital investments are difficult to predict 

the global economy and financial markets experienced disruption in 2009 and 2008 including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others we are unable to predict the likely duration frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world these economic developments affect businesses such as ours and those of our customers and vendors in a number of ways that could result in unfavorable consequences to us disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse changes in economic conditions may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk 

  

in the collectability of our accounts receivable increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 

we have taken actions to address the effects of economic variability including implementing cost control and reduction measures if our business has another downturn we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures 

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics which historically has been highly cyclical 

our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products as evidenced by our 2009 and 2008 business and results of operations the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems we manufacture and market we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products in particular our largest competitor in the semiconductor test segment spends considerably more than us on research and development which may provide it with a competitive advantage we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the market for our products is concentrated and our business depends in part on obtaining orders from a few significant customers 

the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment in each of the years 2012 2011 and 2010 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 29 19 and 21 of consolidated net revenues respectively in any one reporting period a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated net revenues in addition our ability to increase sales will depend in part on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited which may impair our ability to grow revenues we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers including reductions due to market or competitive conditions would likely have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability the following factors are expected to impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

  

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform  

we depend on flextronics international ltd “flextronics” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics or 

  

our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

we may acquire businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenues or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

we have increased our indebtedness 

on april 6 2009 we completed a registered underwritten offering of 1900 million aggregate principal amount of 450 convertible senior notes the “notes” due march 15 2014 and received net proceeds of approximately 1630 million we used approximately 1233 million of the net proceeds of this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility although we are no longer subject to the restrictive covenants under the revolving credit facility we have incurred approximately 1900 million principal amount of new indebtedness that the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the company or that the holders may elect to convert into shares of our common stock in addition on march 31 2009 our whollyowned subsidiary in japan teradyne kk incurred approximately 100 million in indebtedness that we guaranteed the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

  

 our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with goldman sachs  co the “hedge counterparty” with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the 

  

notes the convertible note hedges cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 34703196 shares of our common stock 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into a warrant transaction with the hedge counterparty with a strike price of 767 per share which was 75 higher than the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 the warrants will be net share settled and cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 31963470 shares of our common stock on april 1 2009 the hedge counterparty exercised its option to purchase warrants covering subject to customary antidilution adjustments an additional 2739726 shares of our common stock however we will not be obligated to deliver to the hedge counterparty more than 34526500 shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants which amount represented less than 1999 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of march 31 2009 without giving effect to any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrant transaction subject to customary antidilution adjustments 

the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transaction could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant the net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction to us after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 217 million 

in connection with establishing its initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the hedge counterparty has entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor purchased shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the hedge counterparty may modify its hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2012 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the 

  

weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by our failure to expand operations or earnings in certain countries the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to obtain or maintain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

  

we have significant guarantees indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity additionally we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results for additional information see note l “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties this new requirement could affect the pricing sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products in addition there will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products as a result we may be unable to certify that our products are conflict free 

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions or results of operations 

  

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automatic test equipment we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test semiconductors wireless products hard disk drives and circuit boards in the consumer electronics wireless automotive industrial computing communications and aerospace and defense industries our automatic test equipment products and services include 

 

  

  

 we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers “osats” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics manufacturers of circuit boards automotive suppliers wireless product manufacturers storage device manufacturers aerospace and military contractors 

in 2011 we acquired litepoint corporation “litepoint” to expand our product portfolio of test equipment in the wireless test sector litepoint designs develops and supports advanced wireless test solutions for the development and manufacturing of wireless devices including smart phones tablets notebookslaptops personal computer peripherals and other wifi and cellular enabled devices litepoint is our wireless test segment 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations this was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 where we saw a significant decrease in revenues in our semiconductor test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy which negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry the sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 

we believe our acquisitions of litepoint eagle test and nextest and our entry into the high speed memory and storage test markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth we will continue to invest in our business to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 

on march 21 2011 we completed the sale of our diagnostic solutions business unit which was included in the systems test group segment to spx corporation for 402 million in cash we sold this business as its growth potential as a standalone business was significantly less than if it was part of a larger automotive supplier the financial information for diagnostic solutions has been reclassified to discontinued operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

  

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes deferred tax assets pensions warranties contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 

our equipment has nonsoftware and software components that function together to deliver the equipment’s essential functionality revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “besp” for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 

our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customers’ ability to use the product we defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 60520 “separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts” and asc 60525 “revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements” service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed 

our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 

we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

retirement and postretirement plans 

effective january 1 2012 we changed the method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plan and calculating the expected return on plan assets for our 

  

defined benefit pension plans historically we recognized net actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortized them into operating results over the average remaining years of service of the plan participants to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a range “corridor” we elected to immediately recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans in addition we used to calculate the expected return on plan assets using a calculated marketrelated value of plan assets effective january 1 2012 we elected to calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets 

we believe that this new method is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses in our operating results and it will improve the transparency by faster recognition of the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan obligations and investments these actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly will be recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 250 accounting changes and error corrections all prior periods presented in this annual report on form 10k have been adjusted to apply the new accounting method retrospectively 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718 “ compensation—stock compensation ” as required by asc 718 we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance we consider the probability of future taxable income and our historical profitability among other factors in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance as a result of this review undertaken at december 31 2002 we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions most notably the united states at december 31 2011 we reassessed this judgment and concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized through consideration of both the positive and negative evidence the evidence consisted primarily of our three year us historical cumulative profitability projected future taxable income forecasted utilization of the deferred tax assets and the fourth quarter of 2011 acquisition of litepoint offset by the volatility of the industries we operate in primarily the semiconductor industry as such we reduced the valuation allowance by 1902 million which was recorded as a tax benefit in the year ended december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 and 2011 we maintained a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of 554 million and 511 million respectively primarily related to excess stock compensation deductions associated with pre2006 activity state net operating losses and state tax credit carryforwards due to uncertainty regarding their realization adjustments could be required in the future if we estimate that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount we have recorded 

  

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted which retrospectively reinstated the research and development tax credit for 2012 and extended it through december 31 2013 as a result in the first quarter of 2013 we expect to record a discrete benefit related to 2012 of approximately 70 million 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities ” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

 goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess the impairment of intangible and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess no goodwill impairment was identified in 2012 or 2011

book to bill ratio 

book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows 

 

   

revenues 

net revenues for our three reportable segments were as follows 

 

 the increase in semiconductor test revenues of 215 million or approximately 2 from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in systemonachip “soc” test products for mobility applications partially offset by a decrease in memory system sales 

semiconductor test revenues decreased 3071 million or approximately 22 from 2010 to 2011 due to a decrease in soc product sales semiconductor test product demand can fluctuate significantly from year to year based upon semiconductor device unit growth and installed base utilization the 2011 decrease was due to lower volume from reduced demand 

the decrease in systems test group revenues of 518 million or approximately 18 from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in sales due to lower volume in both storage test systems and commercial board test systems partially offset by an increase in milaero systems and instruments 

the increase in systems test group revenues of 1416 million or approximately 93 from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in sales of storage test systems which was driven by new customers and new product applications 

the acquisition of litepoint which was completed in october of 2011 added 2864 million and 284 million of revenues in 2012 and 2011 respectively litepoint is our wireless test segment 

our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenues for each of the last three years 

 

 net revenues by region as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 

 

   

the breakout of product and service revenues for the past three years was as follows 

 

 our product revenues increased 2234 million or 19 in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to 2824 million of product revenues from the addition of litepoint an increase in soc semiconductor test products for mobility applications and an increase in milaero systems and instruments the increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales in our memory test and storage test systems service revenues which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 43 million or 2 due to higher volume 

our product revenues decreased 1708 million or 13 in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to lower sales of soc semiconductor test products semiconductor test product sales demand can fluctuate significantly from year to year based upon semiconductor device unit growth and installed base utilization the 2011 decrease was due to lower volume from reduced demand the decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of storage test systems which was driven by new customers and new product applications the litepoint acquisition which was completed in october of 2011 added 278 million of product revenue in 2011 service revenues which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 337 million or 14 due to higher volume 

in 2012 revenues from one customer accounted for 10 of our consolidated net revenues in 2011 and 2010 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues in each of the years 2012 2011 and 2010 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 29 19 and 21 of our consolidated net revenues respectively 

gross profit 

 

 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased from 2011 to 2012 by 37 percentage points this increase was a result of an increase of 46 points primarily due to the addition of litepoint partially offset by a decrease of 12 points due to higher inventory provisions 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from 2010 to 2011 by 50 percentage points this decrease was the result of a decrease of 29 points related to product mix primarily from higher storage test system sales a decrease of 09 points for a charge to adjust litepoint acquired inventory to fair value a decrease of 05 points due to lower volume and a decrease of 03 points due to higher inventory provisions 

  

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded an inventory provision of 268 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded an inventory provision of 116 million included in cost of revenues due to the downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of the 116 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2011 104 million was related to semiconductor test primarily due to product transition 11 million was in systems test group and 01 million was in wireless test 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded an inventory provision of 60 million included in cost of revenues due to the downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of the 60 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2010 45 million was related to semiconductor test and 15 million was in systems test group 

during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we scrapped 96 million 92 million and 47 million of inventory respectively and sold 43 million 81 million and 83 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2012 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1418 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

   

the increase of 536 million in engineering and development expenses from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to additional costs of 371 million related to litepoint and increased spending in semiconductor test 

the increase of 59 million in engineering and development expenses from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to additional costs of 60 million related to litepoint 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 462 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to additional costs of 497 million related to litepoint 

the increase of 100 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to additional costs of 97 million related to litepoint 

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2011 to 2012 and from 2010 to 2011 due to the litepoint acquisition 

restructuring and other 

other 

during the year ended december 31 2012 due to a decrease in specified new product revenue through the december 31 2012 earnout period end date we recorded an 88 million fair value adjustment to decrease the litepoint acquisition contingent consideration the 685 million decrease in the contingent consideration liability from december 31 2011 is due to 597 million in payments and the 88 million fair value decrease 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 58 million of other charges of which 46 million related to litepoint acquisition costs and 12 million related to nonus pension settlements 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we had 30 million of gains related to nonus pension settlements 

restructuring 

in response to a downturn in the industry in 2008 and 2009 we initiated restructuring activities across our semiconductor test and systems test group segments to reduce costs principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations the remaining accrual for severance and benefits of 02 million is reflected in the 

  

accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by june 2013 the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities of 11 million is reflected in the other accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid over the next twelve months as of december 31 2012 we have subleased approximately 37 of our unoccupied space 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded the following restructuring activities 

severance and benefits 

   during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded the following restructuring activities 

severance and benefits 

 facilities and exit charges 

 during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded the following restructuring activities 

severance and benefits 

  facilities and exit charges 

 

 interest and other 

 

 interest income decreased by 25 million from 66 million in 2011 to 41 million in 2012 due to a decrease in marketable securities used to fund the litepoint acquisition in 2011 

interest income increased by 07 million from 59 million in 2010 to 66 million in 2011 due primarily to higher cash and marketable securities balances in 2011 

interest expense and other increased by 18 million from 237 million in 2011 to 255 million in 2012 due primarily to higher interest expense from increased convertible debt discount amortization 

  

interest expense and other decreased by 08 million from 245 million in 2010 to 237 million in 2011 due primarily to a loss on the exercise of the auction rate securities related ubs put recorded in 2010 partially offset by higher convertible debt discount amortization in 2011 

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

 the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to higher revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 a 145 million decrease in restructuring and other costs partially offset by a 330 million increase in intangible assets amortization 

the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to lower revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 an 112 million increase in intangible assets amortization a 122 million charge to adjust litepoint acquired inventory to fair value and a 105 million increase in restructuring and other costs 

income taxes 

the income tax expense from continuing operations for 2012 totaled 489 million primarily attributable to a us federal tax provision and foreign taxes the income tax benefit from continuing operations for 2011 totaled 1295 million primarily attributable to the reduction of our deferred income tax valuation allowance we considered the weight of both the positive and negative evidence as of december 31 2011 and concluded that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets will be realized the income tax expense from continuing operations of 167 million for 2010 was related primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes 

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 

 

   

 

  liquidity and capital resources

financing activities during 2012 used cash of 354 million 185 million was from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans and 84 million from the tax benefit related to stock 

  

options and restricted stock units partially offset by 597 million of cash used for payments related to litepoint acquisition contingent consideration and 25 million of cash used for payments on longterm debt related to the japan loan 

in 2011 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired used cash of 940 million this was due to a 432 million decrease in operating assets and a 1372 million decrease in operating liabilities 

the decrease in operating assets was due to a 664 million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from increased collections partially offset by a 226 million increase in prepayments due primarily to supplier prepayments and a 06 million increase in inventories the decrease in operating liabilities was due to a 626 million decrease in customer advance payments due to shipments of systems prepaid by customers a 283 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments a 199 million decrease in accounts payable due to decreased sales volume 119 million of retirement plans contributions an 87 million decrease in accrued income taxes and a 58 million decrease in deferred revenue 

investing activities during 2011 used cash of 1205 million in october 2011 we completed the acquisition of litepoint for an initial cash purchase price net of cash acquired of 5375 million capital expenditures were 861 million proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 6764 million and 5185 million respectively partially offset by 6918 million used for purchase of marketable securities the net proceeds were used to acquire litepoint 

financing activities during 2011 used cash of 163 million due to the repurchase of 26 million shares of common stock for 312 million at an average price of 1184 per share and 25 million for payments on longterm debt related to the japan loan partially offset by 174 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans 

in 2010 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired provided cash of 527 million this was due to a 382 million increase in operating assets and a 909 million increase in operating liabilities 

the increase in operating assets was due to an increase in accounts receivable of 504 million due to higher sales volume partially offset by a 37 million decrease in inventories and a decrease in other current assets of 85 million the increase in operating liabilities was due to a 577 million increase in customer advance payments due primarily to an advanced payment received from one of our semiconductor test customers a 445 million increase in accrued employee compensation due to higher variable compensation and employee stock awards payroll taxes a 150 million increase in accounts payable a 150 million increase in deferred revenue an 85 million increase in accrued income taxes and a 27 million increase in other accrued liabilities partially offset by 525 million of retirement plans contributions 

investing activities during 2010 used cash of 6277 million due to 8708 million used for purchases of marketable securities and 760 million used for purchases of property plant and equipment partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 1812 million and 1368 million respectively and proceeds from life insurance that provided cash of 11 million 

financing activities during 2010 provided cash of 424 million due to 447 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans which was partially offset by 23 million of cash used for payments on longterm debt related to the japan loan 

on april 6 2009 we completed a registered public offering of 1900 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes “notes” and settled the related convertible bond hedge and warrant transaction and received approximately 1630 million as a result of these financing transactions the notes bear interest at a rate 

  

of 450 per annum payable semi annually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year the first interest payment was on september 15 2009 the notes will mature on march 15 2014 unless earlier repurchased by us or converted the notes may be converted under certain circumstances and during certain periods at an initial conversion rate of approximately 18265 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 548 the convertible note hedge and warrant transaction will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the notes to approximately 767 per share of our common stock representing a 75 conversion premium based upon the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity holders of the notes may require us to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the company 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in the us and our operations in the us provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities in the us we have approximately 300 million of cash outside the us that if repatriated would incur additional taxes inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

asc 71520 “compensation – retirement benefits – defined benefit plans” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 260 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the largest portion of our 2012 pension expense was 90 million for our us plan pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment managers and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 50 was an appropriate rate to use for 2012 we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust the rate as necessary the december 31 2012 asset allocation for our us plan is 86 invested in fixed income securities 13 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 

effective january 1 2012 we have elected to immediately recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans in addition we used to calculate the expected return on plan assets using a calculated marketrelated value of plan assets effective january 1 2012 we elected to calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets 

the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 36 at december 31 

  

2012 down from 42 at december 31 2011 we estimate that in 2013 we will recognize approximately 21 million of pension income for the us plan the us plan related pension income estimate for 2013 is based on a 36 discount rate and 50 return on assets future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 

as of december 31 2012 we had an unrecognized pension prior service cost of 07 million 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential us plan income expense for the year ending december 31 2013 which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2013 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 

 

 the assets of the us plan consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities us plan assets have decreased from 3191 million at december 31 2011 to 2789 million at december 31 2012 the decrease was due primarily to 520 million of payments made to certain former us employees which were offered an option to receive their vested pension benefit as a onetime lump sum payment approximately 2000 former employees elected to receive a onetime lump sum payment 

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2012 we made contributions of 17 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 16 million to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries we expect to contribute approximately 18 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan in 2013 contributions that will be made in 2013 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately 20 million we do not expect to make any contributions to the us plan in 2013 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note p “stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 28 2009 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 220 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 254 million shares issuable thereunder 

  

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2012 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

     the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers directors consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2012 was 6413195 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 24 2016 

  

as of december 31 2012 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested awards and options was 521 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 20 years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in euro british pound japanese yen and the taiwan dollar these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2012 and 2011

 of the backlog at december 31 2011 approximately 99 of the semiconductor test backlog 91 of systems test group backlog and 100 of wireless test backlog is expected to be delivered in 2012 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers certain of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can 

  

experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delays or ceases to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 3200 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances we have no collective bargaining contracts 

engineering and development activities

our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles which are difficult to predict 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies and resulting reductions in customer capital investments the duration of slowdowns in customer capital investments are difficult to predict 

the global economy and financial markets experienced disruption in 2009 and 2008 including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world these economic developments affect businesses such as ours and those of our customers and vendors in a number of ways that could result in unfavorable consequences to us disruption and deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse decline in economic conditions may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 

  

we have taken actions to address the effects of the economic crisis including implementing cost control and reduction measures if our business has another downturn we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures 

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics which historically has been highly cyclical 

our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products as evidenced by our 2009 and 2008 business and results of operations the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems we manufacture and market we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability the following factors are expected to impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development or acquisition of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development or acquisition introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform  

we depend on flextronics international ltd “flextronics” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics or our other contract manufacturers it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time difficulties their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could result in a decline in our stock price 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

in october 2011 we acquired litepoint corporation “litepoint” we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring litepoint or successfully grow litepoint’s business we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the 

  

integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

we have increased our indebtedness 

on april 6 2009 we completed a registered underwritten offering of 1900 million aggregate principal amount of 450 convertible senior notes the “notes” due march 15 2014 and received net proceeds of approximately 1630 million we used approximately 1233 million of the net proceeds of this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility although we are no longer subject to the restrictive covenants under the revolving credit facility we have incurred approximately 1900 million principal amount of new indebtedness that the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the company in addition on march 31 2009 our whollyowned subsidiary in japan teradyne kk incurred approximately 100 million in indebtedness that we guaranteed the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

  

 our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with goldman sachs  co the “hedge counterparty” with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the notes the convertible note hedges cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 34703196 shares of our common stock 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into a warrant transaction with the hedge counterparty with a strike price of 767 per share which was 75 higher than the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 the warrants will be net share settled and cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 31963470 shares of our common stock on april 1 2009 the hedge counterparty exercised its option to purchase warrants covering subject to customary antidilution adjustments an additional 2739726 shares of our common stock however we will not be obligated to deliver to the hedge counterparty more than 34526500 shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants which amount represented less than 1999 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of march 31 2009 without giving effect to any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrant transaction subject to customary antidilution adjustments 

the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transaction could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent 

  

that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant the net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction to us after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 217 million 

in connection with establishing its initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the hedge counterparty has entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor purchased shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the hedge counterparty may modify its hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

we have taken measures to significantly lower our fixed costs which could have longterm negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 

we have taken measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products these measures include shifting more of our operations to lower cost regions outsourcing manufacturing processes divesting of certain businesses implementing material cost reduction programs reducing the number of our employees and reducing planned capital expenditures and expense budgets we cannot ensure that the measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete to operate effectively to operate profitably during slowdowns or to effectively meet a rapid increase in customer demand these measures may have longterm negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in our products making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and to quickly respond to customers or competitors in an upward cycle 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2011 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is 

  

imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations and financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our product or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by our failure to expand operations or earnings in certain countries the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to obtain or maintain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

  

we have significant guarantees and indemnification obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results for additional information see note j “commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may have additional pension funding obligations as a result of the weak performance of financial markets and its effect on plan assets 

our future funding obligations for our us defined benefit pension plan qualified with the internal revenue service “irs” depend upon the future performance of assets for this plan the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plan and any changes in government laws and regulations our us qualified defined benefit pension plan currently holds a significant amount of fixed income securities as of december 31 2011 our us qualified defined benefit pension plan had a funded status of approximately 102 due to significant declines in financial markets and deterioration in the value of our plan assets in 2008 we made additional discretionary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2009 and 2010 and may have to make additional contributions in future reporting periods which may negatively affect our cash flow 

the natural disasters in japan and the philippines could disrupt our operations and those of our customers and adversely affect our results of operations 

the recent events in japan and the philippines including earthquakes tsunamis flooding and the related damage created economic uncertainty in those countries based on a review of our global supply chain and the customers’ test facilities we serve in japan and the philippines we do not expect a significant impact on our ability to manufacture and sell our products however there can be no assurance that an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results will not result from these events 

  

our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events widespread health epidemics acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks any one of which could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world our operations and those of our customers and suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fires earthquakes hurricanes volcanic eruptions energy shortages telecommunication failures tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—equity compensation plans” for information on our equity compensation plans and our performance graph 

in november 2007 teradyne’s board of directors the “board” authorized a 400 million stock repurchase program this stock repurchase program was suspended by the board on november 4 2008 the cumulative repurchases as of december 31 2008 totaled 85 million shares of common stock for 1026 million at an average price of 1214 per share 

in november 2010 the board cancelled the november 2007 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to 200 million the cumulative repurchases as of december 31 2011 totaled 26 million shares of common stock for 312 million at an average price of 1184

overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automatic test equipment we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test complex electronics in the consumer electronics automotive computing telecommunications wireless and aerospace and defense industries our automatic test equipment products and services include 

 

  

  

 we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers “osats” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics manufacturers of circuit boards automotive companies wireless product manufacturers storage device manufacturers aerospace and military contractors as well as the united states department of defense 

in 2011 we acquired litepoint corporation “litepoint” to expand our product portfolio of test equipment in the wireless test sector litepoint designs develops and supports advanced wireless test solutions for the development and manufacturing of wireless devices including smart phones tablets notebookslaptops personal computer peripherals and other wifi enabled devices litepoint is our wireless test segment 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations this was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 where we saw a significant decrease in revenue in our semiconductor test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy which negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry the sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 

we believe our acquisitions of nextest eagle test and litepoint and our entry into the high speed memory and storage test markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth we will continue to invest in our business to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs 

we regularly face price competition in each of our businesses more recently we have been subject to greater price competition in the semiconductor test segment we intend to respond to competitive pricing moves as necessary which may adversely impact our gross margins longer term we will continue to invest in engineering to lower the cost of test which should help mitigate the impacts from aggressive pricing actions 

on march 21 2011 we completed the sale of our diagnostic solutions business unit which was included in the systems test group segment to spx corporation for 402 million in cash we sold this business as its growth potential as a standalone business was significantly less than if it was part of a larger automotive supplier the financial information for diagnostic solutions has been reclassified to discontinued operations 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes deferred tax assets pensions warranties contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

in october 2009 fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing nonsoftware and software components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality from the scope of industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance in october 2009 the fasb also amended the accounting standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of 2010 on a prospective basis adoption had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations in 2010 and 2011 

we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 

our equipment has nonsoftware and software components that function together to deliver the equipment’s essential functionality revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “besp” for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 

our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not 

  

affect the customers’ ability to use the product we defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 60520 “separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts” 

our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

for transactions involving the sale of software revenue is recognized in accordance with asc 985605 “software revenue recognition” we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements revenue related to the undelivered elements is deferred to the extent that vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for such elements in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under asc 60535 “revenue recognition constructiontype and productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

inventories 

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 71810 “ compensation—stock compensation ” as required by asc 71810 we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance we consider the probability of future taxable income and our historical profitability among other factors in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance as a result of this review undertaken at december 31 2002 we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions most notably the united states at december 31 2011 we reassessed this judgment and concluded 

  

that it is more likely than not that a substantial majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized through consideration of both the positive and negative evidence the evidence consisted primarily of our three year us historical cumulative profitability projected future taxable income forecasted utilization of the deferred tax assets and the fourth quarter of 2011 acquisition of litepoint offset by the volatility of the industries we operate in primarily the semiconductor industry as such we reduced the valuation allowance by 1902 million which was recorded as a tax benefit in the year ended december 31 2011 we maintain a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of 511 million primarily related to excess stock compensation deductions associated with pre2006 activity state net operating losses and state tax credit carryforwards due to uncertainty regarding their realization adjustments could be required in the future if we estimate that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount we have recorded 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities ” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

 goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 “ intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment ” this new guidance is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the current twostep goodwill impairment test we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011 and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess

revenues 

net revenues for our three reportable segments were as follows 

 

 semiconductor test revenue decreased 3071 million or approximately 22 from 2010 to 2011 due to a decrease in systemonachip “soc” product sales semiconductor test product demand can fluctuate significantly from year to year based upon semiconductor device unit growth and installed base utilization the 2011 decrease was due to lower volume from reduced demand 

semiconductor test revenue increased 8609 million or approximately 156 from 2009 to 2010 due to a strong recovery in the semiconductor market particularly in soc test and due to our strong market share in the higher growth semiconductor test segments such as power management wireless and microcontroller 

the increase in systems test group revenue of 1416 million or approximately 93 from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in sales of storage test systems which was driven by new customers and new product applications 

the decrease in systems test group revenue of 721 million or approximately 32 from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to the decrease in sales of storage test systems and milaero systems and instruments partially offset by an increase in commercial board test sales 

the acquisition of litepoint which was completed in october of 2011 added 284 million of revenue in 2011 litepoint is our wireless test segment 

our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years 

 

 net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue was as follows 

 

   

the breakout of product and service revenue for the past three years was as follows 

 

 our product revenue decreased 1708 million or 13 in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to lower sales of soc semiconductor test products semiconductor test product sales demand can fluctuate significantly from year to year based upon semiconductor device unit growth and installed base utilization the 2011 decrease was due to lower volume from reduced demand the decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of storage test systems which was driven by new customers and new product applications the litepoint acquisition which was completed in october of 2011 added 278 million of product revenue in 2011 service revenue which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 337 million or 14 due to higher volume 

our product revenue increased 7545 million or 131 in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher sales across all semiconductor test products the increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of storage test systems and milaero systems and instruments service revenue increased 343 million or 17 due to higher volume 

in fiscal year 2011 and 2010 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenue in 2009 revenues from one customer accounted for 13 of our consolidated net revenue in each of the years 2011 2010 and 2009 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 19 21 and 27 of our consolidated net revenue respectively 

gross profit 

 

 gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2010 to 2011 by 48 percentage points this decrease was the result of a decrease of 29 points related to product mix primarily from higher storage test system sales a decrease of 09 points for a charge to adjust litepoint acquired inventory to fair value a decrease of 05 points due to lower volume and a decrease of 03 points due to higher inventory provisions 

gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 2009 to 2010 by 162 percentage points this increase in gross profit was the result of an increase of 89 points due to higher product sales volume an increase of 66 points related to product mix and an increase of 18 points due to lower inventory provisions these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 12 points primarily due to higher variable compensation 

  

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded an inventory provision of 116 million included in cost of revenues due to the downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of the 116 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2011 104 million was related to semiconductor test primarily due to product transition 11 million was related to systems test group and 01 million was related to wireless test 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded an inventory provision of 60 million included in cost of revenues due to the downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of the 60 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2010 45 million was related to semiconductor test and 15 million was related to systems test group 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded an inventory provision of 248 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

  

 of the 248 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2009 203 million was related to semiconductor test and 45 million was related to systems test group 

during the year ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we scrapped 92 million 47 million and 296 million of inventory respectively and sold 81 million 83 million and 43 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2011 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1235 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

  

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 26 million in engineering and development expenses from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to additional costs of 60 million related to the acquisition of litepoint in october 2011 partially offset by lower variable compensation 

the increase of 317 million in engineering and development expenses from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to an 186 million increase in variable compensation and 62 million increase from the restoration of temporary salary reductions 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 69 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to additional costs of 97 million related to the acquisition of litepoint in october 2011 partially offset by lower variable compensation 

the increase of 314 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to a 251 million increase in variable compensation and 99 million from the restoration of temporary salary reductions partially offset by a 53 million decrease in other spending related to workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives taken in 2009 

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2010 to 2011 due to the litepoint acquisition which was completed in october of 2011 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2009 to 2010 because intangible assets related to the 2001 genrad acquisition were fully amortized in 2009 

  

restructuring and other 

restructuring 

in response to a downturn in the industry in 2008 and 2009 we implemented restructuring activities across all segments to reduce costs principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations the remaining accrual for severance and benefits of 03 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by july 2012 the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities of 19 million is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the longterm other accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2013 we expect to pay approximately 09 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months our future lease commitments as of december 31 2011 are net of expected sublease income of 05 million as of december 31 2011 we have subleased approximately 37 of our unoccupied space

 during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded 10 million of other net credits related to the following 

 

  

  

 interest and other 

 

   

interest income increased by 07 million from 59 million in 2010 to 66 million in 2011 due primarily to higher cash and marketable securities balances in 2011 

interest income increased by 25 million from 34 million in 2009 to 59 million in 2010 due primarily to a gain on sale of auction rate securities 

interest expense and other decreased by 08 million from 245 million in 2010 to 237 million in 2011 due primarily to a loss on the exercise of the auction rate securities related ubs put recorded in 2010 partially offset by higher convertible debt discount amortization in 2011 

interest expense and other increased by 21 million from 224 million in 2009 to 245 million in 2010 due primarily to a 60 million increase in interest expense related to our convertible senior notes and a loss of 27 million on the exercise of the auction rate security related ubs put in 2009 interest expense and other included 25 million for the write off of the remaining revolving credit facility issue costs due to the termination of our revolving credit facility agreement 21 million in interest expense related to the revolving credit facility and 28 million realized loss on sale and impairment of marketable securities 

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

 the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to lower revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 an 112 million increase in intangible assets amortization a 122 million charge to adjust litepoint acquired inventory to fair value and a 90 million increase in restructuring and other costs 

the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to higher revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 and lower restructuring and other costs in 2010 

income taxes 

the income tax benefit from continuing operations for 2011 totaled 1293 million primarily attributable to the reduction of our deferred income tax valuation allowance we considered the weight of both the positive and negative evidence as of december 31 2011 and concluded that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets will be realized the income tax expense from continuing operations of 145 million for 2010 was related primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes the income tax benefit from continuing operations of 85 million for 2009 was primarily due to federal net operating loss carryback claims 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 

 

  

  liquidity and capital resources 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased 3008 million in 2011 from 2010 to 7546 million cash activity for 2011 2010 and 2009 was as follows 

 

 in 2011 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired used cash of 940 million this was due to a 432 million decrease in operating assets and a 1372 million decrease in operating liabilities 

  

the decrease in operating assets was due to a 664 million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from increased collections partially offset by a 226 million increase in prepayments due primarily to supplier prepayments and a 06 million increase in inventories the decrease in operating liabilities was due to a 626 million decrease in customer advance payments due to shipments of systems prepaid by customers a 283 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to variable compensation payments a 199 million decrease in accounts payable due to decreased sales volume 119 million of retirement plan contributions a 87 million decrease in accrued income taxes and a 58 million decrease in deferred revenue 

investing activities during 2011 used cash of 1205 million in october 2011 we completed the acquisition of litepoint for an initial cash purchase price net of cash acquired of 5375 million capital expenditures were 861 million proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities were 11949 million partially offset by 6918 million used for purchase of marketable securities the net proceeds were used to acquire litepoint 

financing activities during 2011 used cash of 163 million due to the repurchase of 26 million shares of common stock for 312 million at an average price of 1184 per share and 25 million for payments on longterm debt partially offset by 174 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans 

in 2010 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired provided cash of 527 million this was due to a 382 million increase in operating assets and a 909 million increase in operating liabilities the increase in operating assets was due to an increase in accounts receivable of 504 million due to higher sales volume partially offset by a 37 million decrease in inventories and a decrease in other current assets of 85 million the increase in operating liabilities was due to a 577 million increase in customer advance payments due primarily to an advanced payment received from one of our semiconductor test customers a 445 million increase in accrued employee compensation due to higher variable compensation a 150 million increase in accounts payable a 150 million increase in deferred revenue an 85 million increase in accrued income taxes and a 27 million increase in other accrued liabilities partially offset by 525 million of retirement plan contributions 

investing activities during 2010 used cash of 6277 million due to 8708 million used for purchases of marketable securities and 760 million used for purchases of property plant and equipment partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 3181 million and proceeds from life insurance that provided cash of 11 million 

financing activities during 2010 provided cash of 424 million due to 447 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans which was partially offset by 23 million of cash used for payments on longterm debt related to the japan loan 

in 2009 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired provided cash of 789 million this was due to a decrease in operating assets of 427 million and an increase in operating liabilities of 362 million the decrease in operating assets consisted mainly of a decrease in inventory of 632 million partially offset by an increase of 193 million in accounts receivable due to higher sales volume the increase in operating liabilities consisted of an increase in advanced customer payments accounts payable deferred revenue and other accrued expenses of 515 million partially offset by retirement plan contributions of 153 million the 433 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advances in 2009 is due to an advanced payment of approximately 682 million received from one of our semiconductor test customers the customer received an incremental discount and also wanted to secure its position in our manufacturing slot plan this increase in customer advances was partially offset by a 249 million decrease in deferred revenue 

investing activities in 2009 used cash of 933 million due to investments in property plant and equipment of 413 million payment of transaction fees related to the eagle test acquisition of 37 million and purchases of marketable securities of 904 million partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 410 million and proceeds from life insurance policies that provided cash of 11 million 

  

during 2009 financing activities provided cash of 661 million due to approximately 1630 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior convertible notes 100 million of longterm debt proceeds from a loan in japan and 157 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans these increases were partially offset by 1225 million of cash used for the repayment of our revolving credit facility and 11 million of cash used for principal payment on longterm debt 

on april 6 2009 we completed a registered public offering of 1900 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes “notes” and settled the related convertible bond hedge and warrant transaction and received approximately 1630 million as a result of these financing transactions the notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per annum payable semi annually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year the first interest payment was on september 15 2009 the notes will mature on march 15 2014 unless earlier repurchased by us or converted the notes may be converted under certain circumstances and during certain periods at an initial conversion rate of approximately 18265 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 548 the convertible note hedge and warrant transaction will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the notes to approximately 767 per share of our common stock representing a 75 conversion premium based upon the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity holders of the notes may require us to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the company 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months we do not have significant cash outside the us that if repatriated would incur additional taxes in addition the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in the us and our operations in the us provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities in the us inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

asc 71520 “compensation – retirement benefits – defined benefit plans” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 150 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the largest portion of our 2011 pension expense was 70 million for our us plan pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment managers and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 55 was an appropriate rate to use for 2011 we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust the rate as necessary the december 31 2011 asset allocation for our us plan is 87 invested in fixed income securities 12 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other 

  

securities our investment managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 

we base our determination of pension expense on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2011 under the us plan we had cumulative gains of approximately 233 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 42 at december 31 2011 down from 53 at december 31 2010 we estimate that in 2012 we will recognize approximately 124 million of pension expense for the us plan the us plan related pension expense estimate for 2012 is based on a 42 discount rate and 50 return on us plan assets future pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans as of december 31 2011 we had unrecognized pension losses and prior service costs of 1341 million of which 1177 million is for the us plan 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential us plan expense for the year ending december 31 2012 that would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 

 

 the assets of the us plan consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities the value of our us plan assets has increased from 2757 million at december 31 2010 to 3191 million at december 31 2011 our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2011 we made a contribution of 17 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 85 million contribution to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries we expect to contribute approximately 18 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan in 2012 contributions that will be made in 2012 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately 17 million we do not expect to make any contributions to the us plan in 2012 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note n “stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have the 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 the 2006 equity plan replaced our 1996 nonemployee director stock option plan our 1997 employee stock option plan and our 1991 employee stock option plan each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 equity plan we may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise vesting or expiration as applicable 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 28 2009 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 

  

220 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 254 million shares issuable thereunder 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2011 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

      the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers directors consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2011 was 12160945 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock 

  

options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 24 2016 

as of december 31 2011 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested awards and options totaled 603 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 26 years

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 “comprehensive income” this asu intends to enhance comparability and transparency of other comprehensive income components the guidance provides an option to present total comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements this asu eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income components as part of the statement of changes in shareowners’ equity the provisions of this asu will be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 early application is permitted this asu requires changes in presentation only and we do not expect it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 “ intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment ” this new guidance is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the current twostep goodwill impairment test this new guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 early adoption is permitted and we adopted the standard in the fourth quarter of 2011 the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in euro british pound japanese yen and the taiwan dollar these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10 fluctuation in interest rates was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2011 and 2010

see also “item 1a risk factors” and “note p operating segment geographic and significant customer information” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments competitors in the semiconductor test segment include among others advantest corporation “advantest” verigy inc “verigy” and ltx–credence corporation “ltx” the potential mergers between verigy and ltx or between advantest and verigy may result in a combined company that may be a stronger competitor in certain markets competitors in the systems test group include among others agilent technologies inc and xyratex ltd some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

  

  

backlog 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 our backlog of unfilled orders in our two reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2010 approximately 98 of the semiconductor test backlog and 88 of systems test group backlog is expected to be delivered in 2011 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers certain of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers’ delays or ceases to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we employed approximately 3000 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances we have no collective bargaining contracts 

  

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were 1970 million 1648 million and 2165 million respectively these expenditures amounted to approximately 12 20 and 20 of consolidated net revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated the amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of investigation estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

  

our executive officers 

pursuant to general instruction g3 of form 10k the following table is included in part i of this annual report on form 10k in lieu of being included in the proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders the table sets forth the names of all of our executive officers and certain other information relating to their positions held with teradyne and other business experience our executive officers do not have a specific term of office but rather serve at the discretion of the board of directors 

 

 


 item 1a risk factors 

risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles which are difficult to predict 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies and resulting reductions in customer capital investments the duration of slowdowns in customer capital investments are difficult to predict 

the global economy and financial markets experienced disruption in 2009 including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world these economic developments affect businesses such as ours and those of our customers and vendors in a number of ways that could result in unfavorable consequences to us disruption and deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse decline in economic conditions may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 

  

in 2009 and 2008 we took actions to address the effects of the economic crisis including implementing cost control and reduction measures if our business has another downturn we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures 

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics which historically has been highly cyclical 

our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products as evidenced by our 2009 and 2008 business and results of operations the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems we manufacture and market we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 

the potential mergers between verigy and ltxcredence or between advantest and verigy may result in a combined company that may be a stronger competitor in certain markets moreover increased competitive pressure resulting from one of these mergers could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability the following factors are expected to impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform  

we depend on flextronics international ltd “flextronics” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china if for any reason flextronics cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time difficulties their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could result in a decline in our stock price 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances 

in january 2008 we acquired nextest and in november 2008 we acquired eagle test we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and 

  

cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

we have increased our indebtedness 

on april 6 2009 we completed a registered underwritten offering of 1900 million aggregate principal amount of 450 convertible senior notes the “notes” due march 15 2014 and received net proceeds of approximately 1630 million we used approximately 1233 million of the net proceeds of this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility although we are no longer subject to the restrictive covenants under the revolving credit facility we have incurred approximately 1900 million principal amount of new indebtedness that the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the company in addition on march 31 2009 our whollyowned subsidiary in japan teradyne kk incurred approximately 100 million in indebtedness that we guaranteed the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

  

 our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with goldman sachs  co the “hedge counterparty” with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the notes the convertible note hedges cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 34703196 shares of our common stock 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into a warrant transaction with the hedge counterparty with a strike price of 76650 per share which was 75 higher than the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 the warrants will be net share settled and cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 31963470 shares of our common stock on april 1 2009 the hedge counterparty exercised its option to purchase warrants covering subject to customary antidilution adjustments an additional 2739726 shares of our common stock however we will not be obligated to deliver to the hedge counterparty more than 34526500 shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants which amount represented less than 1999 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of march 31 2009 without giving effect to any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrant transaction subject to customary antidilution adjustments 

the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transaction could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent 

  

that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant the net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction to us after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 217 million 

in connection with establishing its initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the hedge counterparty has entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor purchased shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the hedge counterparty may modify its hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

we have taken measures to significantly lower our fixed costs which could have longterm negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 

we have taken measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products these measures include shifting more of our operations to lower cost regions outsourcing manufacturing processes divesting of certain businesses implementing material cost reduction programs reducing the number of our employees and reducing planned capital expenditures and expense budgets we cannot ensure that the measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete to operate effectively to operate profitably during slowdowns or to effectively meet a rapid increase in customer demand these measures may have longterm negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in our products making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and to quickly respond to customers or competitors in an upward cycle 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2010 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 

  

both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations and financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our product or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by our failure to expand operations or earnings in certain countries the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to obtain or maintain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

  

we have significant guarantees and indemnification obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results for additional information see “note i commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may have additional pension funding obligations as a result of the weak performance of financial markets and its effect on plan assets 

our future funding obligations for our us defined benefit pension plan qualified with the internal revenue service “irs” depend upon the future performance of assets for this plan the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations our us defined benefit pension plan currently holds a significant amount of fixed income and equity securities as of december 31 2010 our us qualified defined benefit pension plan had a funded status of approximately 104 due to significant declines in financial markets and deterioration in the value of our plan assets in 2008 we made additional discretionary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plan in 2009 and 2010 and may have to make additional contributions in future reporting periods which may negatively affect our cash flow 

acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact our business 

acts of war and terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees facilities customers suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition we as well as our outsourced manufacturing providers and our suppliers sell and manufacture products both in the united states and internationally the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at these locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems we have completed some emergency preparedness planning and have a business continuity plan in case some of these events occur however we cannot be certain that our plans will be effective in the event of a disaster or other situation all of these conditions make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

overview 

we are a leading global supplier of automatic test equipment we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test complex electronics in the consumer electronics automotive computing telecommunications and aerospace and defense industries our automatic test equipment products and services include 

 

  

   

we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced subassembly and test providers “osats” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” manufacturers of circuit boards automotive companies hdd manufacturers aerospace and military contractors as well as the united states department of defense 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations this was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 where we saw a significant decrease in revenue in our semiconductor test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy which negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry the sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 

commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009 we experienced improvement in our semiconductor test business we believe our acquisitions of nextest and eagle test and our entry into the high speed memory and hdd markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth we will continue to invest in our business to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs as 2010 demonstrated with our current cost structure we can achieve significantly higher profitability than we achieved at comparable revenue levels in the past 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes deferred tax assets pensions warranties contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing nonsoftware and software components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality from the scope of industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance in october 2009 the fasb also amended the accounting standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of 2010 on a prospective basis adoption had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations in 2010 

we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and 

  

collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 

our equipment has nonsoftware and software components that function together to deliver the equipment’s essential functionality revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “besp” for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 

our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customers’ ability to use the product we defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 60520 “separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts” 

our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

for transactions involving the sale of software revenue is recognized in accordance with asc 985605 “software revenue recognition” we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements revenue related to the undelivered elements is deferred to the extent that vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for such elements in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under asc 60535 “revenue recognition constructiontype and productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

  

inventories 

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

stockbased compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 71810 as required by asc 71810 we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest 

on may 26 2005 our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding unvested “out of the money” stock options awarded to employees officers and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of 1326 the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may 26 2005 and ranged in exercise price from 1373 to 4137 per share as a result of the vesting acceleration options to purchase approximately 76 million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under asc 71810 by approximately 486 million in the aggregate on a pretax basis over fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance as a result of this review undertaken at december 31 2002 we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions most notably the united states due to the continued uncertainty of realization we have maintained our valuation allowance at december 31 2010 and 2009 we will assess the level of the valuation allowance required in future periods should more positive than negative evidence regarding the realizability of tax attributes exist in a future period the valuation allowance may be reduced or eliminated altogether reduction of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a noncash income tax benefit during the period of reduction 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities ” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

 we determined that we did not intend to hold certain marketable securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value and recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss in the amount of 07 million and 110 million respectively in the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 primarily related to mortgage and asset backed debt securities 

  

  

as a result of our november 14 2008 acquisition of eagle test we acquired 265 million of auction rate securities “ars” at fair value 300 million par value in addition we acquired 1 the right “ubs put” to sell our ars back to ubs at par plus interest at our sole discretion during a twoyear period beginning on june 30 2010 and 2 received an option to borrow up to 75 of the fair value of the ars at no cost we classified the ars as trading securities under asc 32010 the ars portfolio was repurchased by ubs in 2010 and we no longer own any ars securities 

on november 14 2008 we also recognized the ubs put as an asset measured at a fair value of 27 million the ubs put was exercised in june 2010 at december 31 2009 the fair value of the ubs put was 28 million during 2009 we recorded a 05 million loss in interest expense for the decrease in the fair value of the ubs put during 2008 we recorded 06 million gain in interest income for an increase in the fair value 

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

we considered the significant adverse change in the business climate for our products at the end of 2008 a triggering event for testing the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets based upon a review of the operations and activities associated with our longlived assets we determined that our longlived assets should be grouped with other assets and liabilities and identified four asset groups system on a chiphigh speed memory nextest eagle test and assembly test that resulted in the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we identified developed technology as the primary asset for the nextest and eagle test asset groups test system fixed assets as the primary asset for the system on a chiphigh speed memory asset group and fixed assets as the primary asset for the assembly test asset group 

we tested the recoverability of our asset groups by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to the asset group’s carrying amount the projections utilized in the undiscounted cash flows to test the recoverability of the asset groups were consistent with the underlying projections utilized in our 2008 goodwill impairment evaluation except that the undiscounted cash flows included only the future cash flows directly associated with the direct use and eventual disposition of the asset group the sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the asset groups and as a result the carrying amount of asset groups was deemed recoverable as a result no impairment loss was recognized no impairment indicators were present in 2010 or 2009

 results of operations 

book to bill ratio 

book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows 

 

 revenues 

net revenues for our two reportable segments were as follows 

 

   

semiconductor test revenue increased 8609 million or approximately 156 from 2009 to 2010 due to a strong recovery in the semiconductor market particularly in soc test and due to our strong market share in the higher growth semiconductor test segments such as power management wireless and microcontroller 

semiconductor test revenue decreased 3479 million or approximately 39 from 2008 to 2009 due to excess test capacity at our customers as a result of the global economic downturn the eagle test acquisition which was completed in november of 2008 added 610 million of revenue in 2009 compared to 25 million in 2008 

the decrease in systems test group revenue of 716 million or approximately 27 from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to the decrease in sales of hard disk drive test systems and milaero systems and instruments partially offset by an increase in commercial board test sales while diagnostic solutions product and service sales remained flat 

the increase in systems test group revenue of 603 million or approximately 29 from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to sales of hard disk drive test systems partially offset by a decrease in commercial board test and diagnostic solutions sales while milaero product and service sales remained flat 

our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years 

 

 net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue was as follows 

 

 the breakout of product and service revenue for the past three years was as follows 

 

 our product revenue increased 7540 million or 127 in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher sales across all semiconductor test products the increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of hard disk 

  

drive test systems and milaero systems and instruments service revenue which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 353 million or 16 

our product revenue decreased 2407 million or 29 in 2009 from 2008 due to lower sales across all semiconductor test commercial board test and diagnostic solutions products as a result of excess test capacity at our customers due to the global economic downturn the decrease was partially offset by sales of hard disk drive test systems the eagle test acquisition which was completed in november of 2008 added 526 million of product revenue in 2009 service revenue decreased 469 million or 17 due to the global economic downturn 

in 2010 and 2008 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenue in 2009 revenues from one customer accounted for approximately 12 of our consolidated net revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 21 26 and 14 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

gross profit 

 

 gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 2009 to 2010 by 163 percentage points this increase in gross profit was the result of an increase of 89 points due to higher product sales volume an increase of 66 points related to product mix and an increase of 18 points due to lower inventory provisions these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 12 points primarily due to higher variable compensation 

gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2008 to 2009 by 70 percentage points this decrease in gross profit was the result of a decrease of 52 points due to lower product sales volume a decrease of 41 points related to higher product revenue as a percentage of total revenue which included the growth of hard disk drive test system revenues and a decrease of 15 points for a charge to adjust eagle test acquired inventory to fair value these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 38 points primarily from lower operations spending due to workforce reductions and lower freight and warranty charges which were the result of lower product sales 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

  

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded an inventory provision of 62 million included in cost of revenues due to the downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels of the 62 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2010 45 million was related to semiconductor test and 17 million was related to systems test group 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded an inventory provision of 280 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

  

 of the 280 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2009 203 million was related to semiconductor test and 77 million was related to systems test group 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded an inventory provision of 294 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

 of the 294 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2008 249 million was related to semiconductor test and 45 million was related to systems test group 

during the year ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we scrapped 53 million 316 million and 98 million of inventory respectively and sold 86 million 43 million and 24 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2010 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1261 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

   

the increase of 322 million in engineering and development expenses from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to an 186 million increase in variable compensation and 62 million increase from the restoration of temporary salary reductions 

the decrease of 517 million in engineering and development expenses from 2008 to 2009 was mainly due to a 549 million decrease in spending as a result of workforce reductions and lower project spending and a 62 million decrease due to temporary salary reductions this decrease was partially offset by additional costs of 94 million related to the acquisition of eagle test in november 2008 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 297 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to a 251 million increase in variable compensation and 99 million from the restoration of temporary salary reductions partially offset by a 53 million decrease in other spending related to workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives taken in 2009 

the decrease in selling and administrative spending of 474 million from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to a 573 million decrease from workforce reductions and ongoing cost reduction initiatives and a 99 million decrease due to temporary salary reductions partially offset by additional costs of 198 million related to the acquisition of eagle test in november 2008 

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2009 to 2010 because intangible assets related to the 2001 genrad acquisition were fully amortized in 2009 acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2008 to 2009 due to the eagle test acquisition which was completed in november of 2008 

goodwill impairment 

we experienced a worsening in our demand outlook during the fourth quarter of 2008 this sharp decline led to a 3297 million noncash impairment of all our goodwill balance 

inprocess research and development 

in 2008 we recorded an expense of 16 million related to inprocess research and development related to the acquisition of nextest and eagle test 

  

restructuring and other 

restructuring 

in response to a downturn in the industry in 2008 and 2009 we implemented restructuring activities across all segments to reduce costs principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations the remaining accrual for severance and benefits of 18 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by the end of first quarter of 2011 the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities of 39 million is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the longterm other accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2013 we expect to pay approximately 19 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months our future lease commitments as of december 31 2010 are net of expected sublease income of 10 million as of december 31 2010 we have subleased approximately 53 of our unoccupied space 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded restructuring charges of 53 million related to ongoing efforts to lower expenses and our cost structure 27 million credit related to the early exit of previously impaired facilities and 03 million related to a change in estimated severance benefits for the q2 2009 action the restructuring charges consisted of the following activities

 interest and other 

 

 interest income increased by 47 million from 34 million in 2009 to 81 million in 2010 due primarily to a gain on sale of auction rate securities of 27 million and an increase in cash and marketable securities balances in 2010 interest income decreased by 92 million from 126 million in 2008 to 34 million in 2009 due primarily to lower cash balances as a result of the acquisitions of nextest and eagle test and lower interest rates 

interest expense and other increased by 35 million from 236 million in 2009 to 271 million in 2010 due primarily to a 60 million increase in interest expense related to our convertible senior notes a loss of 27 million on the exercise of the auction rate security related ubs put and a 26 million increase primarily in marketable securities amortization due to the higher marketable securities balance in 2009 interest expense and other included 25 million for the write off of the remaining revolving credit facility issue costs due to the termination of our revolving credit facility agreement 21 million in interest expense related to the revolving credit facility and 28 million realized loss on sale and impairment of marketable securities

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

   

the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to higher revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 and lower restructuring and other costs in 2010 the decrease in loss from continuing operations before income taxes from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2008 lower spending and lower restructuring and other costs in 2009 compared to 2008 partially offset by lower revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 

income taxes 

the income tax expense from continuing operations for 2010 of 148 million was related primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes the income tax benefit from continuing operations of 88 million for 2009 was primarily due to federal net operating loss carryback claims the income tax expense from continuing operations for 2008 of 126 million was related primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes 

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 

 

  

    

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased 5367 million in 2010 from 2009 to 10555 million cash activity for 2010 2009 and 2008 was as follows in millions 

 

 in 2010 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses acquired provided cash of 516 million this was due to a 382 million increase in operating assets and an 898 million increase in operating liabilities the increase in operating assets was due to an increase in accounts receivable of 512 million due to higher sales volume partially offset by a 46 million decrease in inventories and a decrease in other current assets of 84 million the increase in operating liabilities was due to a 577 million increase in customer advance payments due primarily to an advanced payment received from one of our semiconductor test customers a 445 million increase in accrued employee compensation due to higher variable compensation a 152 million increase in accounts payable a 137 million increase in deferred revenue an 85 million increase in accrued income taxes and a 27 million increase in other accrued liabilities partially offset by 525 million of retirement plan contributions 

investing activities during 2010 used cash of 6277 million due to 8708 million used for purchases of marketable securities and 760 million used for purchases of property plant and equipment partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 3181 million and proceeds from life insurance that provided cash of 11 million 

financing activities during 2010 provided cash of 424 million due to 447 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans which was partially offset by 23 million of cash used for payments on longterm debt related to the japan loan 

in 2009 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired provided cash of 785 million this was due to a decrease in operating assets of 471 million and an increase in operating liabilities of 314 million the decrease in operating assets consisted mainly of a decrease in inventory of 634 million partially offset by an increase of 156 million in accounts receivable due to higher sales volume the increase in operating liabilities consisted of an increase in advanced customer payments accounts payable deferred revenue and other accrued expenses of 467 million partially offset by retirement plan contributions of 153 million the 464 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advances in 2009 is due to an advanced payment of approximately 682 million received from one of our semiconductor test customers the customer received an incremental discount and also wanted to secure its position in our manufacturing slot plan this increase in customer advances was partially offset by a 218 million decrease in deferred revenue 

  

investing activities in 2009 used cash of 939 million due to investments in property plant and equipment of 419 million payment of transaction fees related to the eagle test acquisition of 37 million and purchases of marketable securities of 904 million partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of 410 million and proceeds from life insurance policies that provided cash of 11 million 

during 2009 financing activities provided cash of 661 million due to approximately 1630 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior convertible notes 100 million of longterm debt proceeds from a loan in japan and 157 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans these increases were partially offset by 1225 million of cash used for the repayment of our revolving credit facility and 11 million of cash used for principal payment on longterm debt 

on april 6 2009 we completed a registered public offering of 1900 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes “notes” and settled the related convertible bond hedge and warrant transaction and received approximately 1630 million as a result of these financing transactions the notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year the first interest payment was on september 15 2009 the notes will mature on march 15 2014 unless earlier repurchased by us or converted the notes may be converted under certain circumstances and during certain periods at an initial conversion rate of approximately 18265 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 548 the convertible note hedge and warrant transaction will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the notes to approximately 767 per share of our common stock representing a 75 conversion premium based upon the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity holders of the notes may require us to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the company 

in 2008 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired provided cash of 386 million this was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable of 1182 million as a result of a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a decrease in days sales outstanding from 66 days in 2007 to 51 days in 2008 as a result of improved collections this was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accruals of 316 million and an increase in other assets of 327 million 

in 2008 investing activities used cash of 4491 million we completed the acquisition of nextest and eagle test for a total cash purchase price and related fees net of cash acquired of 5743 million capital expenditures were 872 million in 2008 proceeds from asset disposals were 617 million and primarily consisted of sales of real estate 

in 2008 financing activities provided cash of 463 million in november of 2008 we obtained a revolving credit facility that provided net cash of 1197 million the credit facility had a three year term that was to end on november 14 2011 as of december 31 2008 the outstanding balance under the credit facility was 1225 million the credit facility contained customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants including the financial measures of a leverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio and available domestic cash to total revolving borrowings ratio as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility on april 7 2009 we repaid and terminated our revolving credit facility agreement we used approximately 1233 million of the net proceeds of the convertible senior notes transaction to repay 1225 million of principal and 08 million of accrued interest outstanding under the revolving credit facility agreement 

in 2008 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans provided cash of 178 million 

in november 2007 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to spend an aggregate of 4000 million to repurchase shares of our common stock during 2008 we repurchased 75 million 

  

shares of common stock for 912 million at an average price of 1220 per share as of november 4 2008 the board of directors suspended the stock repurchase program in november 2010 our board cancelled the november 2007 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to 200 million during the year ended december 31 2010 we did not repurchase any shares of common stock 

we expect that our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of 10555 million will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

we adopted the funded status recognition provision of asc 71520 “compensation – retirement benefits – defined benefit plans” effective december 31 2006 asc 71520 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan “us plan” certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a us supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 78 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the largest portion of our 2010 pension expense was 28 million for our supplemental executive defined benefit plan pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on us plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment managers and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 75 was an appropriate rate to use for 2010 we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust the rate as necessary the december 31 2010 asset allocation for our us plan is 57 invested in fixed income securities 37 invested in equity securities and 6 invested in other securities the february 18 2011 asset allocation for our us plan is 69 invested in fixed income securities 30 invested in equity securities and 1 invested in other securities our investment managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 

we base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2010 under the us plan we had cumulative losses of approximately 201 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the us plan’s expected cash flows and was 53 at december 31 2010 down from 585 at december 31 2009 we estimate that in 2011 we will recognize approximately 69 million of pension expense for the us plan the us plan related pension expense estimate for 2011 is based on a 53 discount rate and 55 return on us plan assets future pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans as of december 31 2010 we had unrecognized pension losses and prior service costs of 1295 million of which 1201 million is for the us plan 

  

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential change in our us plan expense for the year ending december 31 2011 that would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 

 

 the assets of the us plan consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities the value of our us plan assets has increased from 2171 million at december 31 2009 to 2757 million at december 31 2010 our funding policy is to make contributions to the pension plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2010 we made a discretionary contribution of 450 million to the us plan 17 million contribution to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 38 million contribution to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries we expect to contribute approximately 17 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan in 2011 contributions that will be made in 2011 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately 22 million we do not expect to make any contributions to the us plan in 2011 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in “note m stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have the 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 the 2006 equity plan replaced our 1996 nonemployee director stock option plan our 1997 employee stock option plan and our 1991 employee stock option plan each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 equity plan we may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise vesting or expiration as applicable 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 28 2009 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 220 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 254 million shares issuable thereunder 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2010 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

   

     the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers directors consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2010 was 15183151 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 24 2016 in 2010 and 2009 we granted restricted stock units to employees and directors and restricted stock units and stock options to executive officers in 2008 we granted restricted stock unit awards to our employees executive officers and directors 

as of december 31 2010 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested awards and options totaled 382 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in euro british pound japanese yen and the taiwan dollar these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10 fluctuation in interest rates was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2010 and 2009

competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments competitors in the semiconductor test segment include among others advantest corporation verigy inc and ltx–credence corporation competitors in the systems test group include among others agilent technologies inc and xyratex ltd some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2009 and 2008 our backlog of unfilled orders in our two reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2009 approximately 99 of the semiconductor test backlog and 85 of systems test group backlog is expected to be delivered in 2010 

  

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers certain of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delays or ceases to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 2900 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances we have no collective bargaining contracts 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were 1648 million 2165 million and 2043 million respectively these expenditures amounted to approximately 20 20 and 19 of consolidated net revenue in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated the amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of investigation estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles which are difficult to predict 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies and resulting reductions in customer capital investments the duration of slowdowns in customer capital investments are difficult to predict 

the global economy and financial markets experienced disruption in 2009 including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others governments have taken historic actions intended to address extreme market conditions that include severely restricted credit there may be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world these economic developments affect businesses such as ours and those of our customers and vendors in a number of ways that could result in unfavorable consequences to us further disruption and deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse decline in economic conditions may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues in 2009 

  

and 2008 we took actions to address the effects of the economic crisis including implementing cost control and reduction measures it is possible that we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset certain of the negative trends that might affect our business 

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics which historically has been highly cyclical 

our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products as evidenced by our current business and results of operations the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems we manufacture and market we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability the following factors are expected to impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependant upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements many of our suppliers implemented cost reduction strategies to address the slowdowns in the market in the second half of 2009 several of our suppliers had material shortages which increased the lead times for certain of our products we implemented programs to minimize the impact of these shortages however it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform  

we depend on flextronics international ltd “flextronics” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china if for any reason flextronics cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time difficulties their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully 

  

coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could result in a decline in our stock price 

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisition of nextest eagle test and other businesses that we may acquire or strategic alliances that we may form in the future 

in january 2008 we acquired nextest and in november 2008 we acquired eagle test we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of nextest eagle test and other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

we have increased our indebtedness 

on april 6 2009 we completed a registered underwritten offering of 1900 million aggregate principal amount of 450 convertible senior notes the “notes” due march 15 2014 and received net proceeds of approximately 1630 million we used approximately 1233 million of the net proceeds of this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility although we are no longer subject to the restrictive covenants under the revolving credit facility we have incurred approximately 1900 million principal amount of new indebtedness that the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the company in addition on march 31 2009 our whollyowned subsidiary in japan teradyne kk incurred approximately 100 million in indebtedness that we guaranteed the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

  

 our convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock 

concurrent with the offering of the notes we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with goldman sachs  co the “hedge counterparty” with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the notes the convertible note hedges cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments approximately 34703196 shares of our common stock 

separately and concurrent with the pricing of the notes we entered into a warrant transaction with the hedge counterparty with a strike price of 76650 per share which is 75 higher than the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 the warrants will be net share settled and cover subject to customary 

  

antidilution adjustments approximately 31963470 shares of our common stock on april 1 2009 the hedge counterparty exercised its option to purchase warrants covering subject to customary antidilution adjustments an additional 2739726 shares of our common stock however we will not be obligated to deliver to the hedge counterparty more than 34526500 shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants which amount represents less than 1999 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of march 31 2009 without giving effect to any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrant transaction subject to customary antidilution adjustments 

the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes however the warrant transaction could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant the net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction to us after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately 217 million 

in connection with establishing its initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the hedge counterparty has entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock andor purchase shares of our common stock or other securities including the notes concurrent with or shortly after the pricing of the notes in addition the hedge counterparty may modify its hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities including the notes in secondary market transactions and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the notes these activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the notes 

we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 

if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of our other obligations we would be in default under the terms thereof which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial position and operating results in addition we cannot be certain that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations or if the holders of the notes require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving us moreover we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 

we have taken measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products which could have longterm negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 

we have taken measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products these measures include shifting more of our operations to lower cost regions outsourcing manufacturing processes divesting of certain businesses implementing material cost reduction programs reducing the number of our employees and reducing planned capital expenditures and expense budgets we cannot ensure that the measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete to operate effectively to operate profitably during slowdowns or to effectively meet a rapid increase in customer demand these measures may have longterm negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in our products making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and to quickly respond to customers or competitors in an upward cycle 

  

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or cost including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2009 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations and financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our product or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

  

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and such other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by our failure to expand operations or earnings in certain countries the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions in certain foreign jurisdictions we qualify for tax incentives based on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various tests relating to our employment levels research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results in addition we may incur additional costs including headcount expenses in order to obtain or maintain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction 

we have significant guarantees and indemnification obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results for additional information see “note j commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property “ip” we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

we may have additional pension funding obligations as a result of the weak performance of financial markets and its effect on plan assets 

our future funding obligations for our us defined benefit pension plan qualified with the internal revenue service “irs” depend upon the future performance of assets for this plan the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations our defined benefit pension plan currently holds a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities due to our contributions and the strong performance of these assets during prior periods our us defined benefit pension plan has been over funded prior to 2008 which allowed us to maintain a surplus without making additional contributions to the plan however due to significant declines in financial markets and deterioration in the value of our plan assets we made additional discretionary contributions to our us defined benefit pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2010 and may make additional contributions in future reporting periods which would negatively affect our cash flow 

acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact our business 

acts of war and terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees facilities customers suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as we our outsourced manufacturing providers and our suppliers sell and manufacture products both in the united states and internationally the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at these locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems we have completed some emergency preparedness planning and have a business continuity plan in case some of these events occur however we cannot be certain that our plans will be effective in the event of a disaster or other situation all of these conditions make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

during 2007 we made several important corporate governance changes which included declassification of our board of directors adoption of majority voting standard for the election of our directors and early termination of our shareholder rights plan despite these changes there are still provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 11 2008 xyratex technology ltd “xyratex” filed a complaint against us in the united states district court in los angeles california alleging that certain of our disk drive test products infringe one of xyratex’s patents the suit sought temporary preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as unspecified monetary damages including treble damages for patent infringement we filed separate complaints in the united states district court in los angeles alleging that xyratex’s disk drive test products infringe two of our patents and that xyratex had engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of the federal antitrust laws prior to trial 

  

on december 14 2009 the parties entered into a settlement agreement agreeing to settle all of the pending litigation between them the settlement had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations although there can be no assurance we do not expect the settlement to negatively impact our business 

on september 5 2001 after our august 2000 acquisition of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc the former owners of those companies filed a complaint against us and two of our then executive officers in the united states district court in san diego california asserting securities fraud and breach of contract related to the acquisition the district court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs’ claims granted partial summary judgment against them with respect to their breach of contract claim and denied their motion for reconsideration in july 2007 after an appeal by the plaintiffs the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court rulings we petitioned the ninth circuit for rehearing which was denied and the case was remanded back to the district court on august 29 2008 the district court granted us motion for judgment on the pleadings on september 11 2008 the plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal in august 2009 the parties agreed to settle the litigation the settlement had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

in november 2008 we received a general notice letter from the california department of toxic substances control “dtsc” that informed us of potential liability with respect to contamination at the bkk corporation landfill facility site in west covina california this claim arose out of our acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 neither we nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the west covina site we have asked the dtsc and the group of settling defendants to remove us as a potentially responsible party “prp” for this site 

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as but not limited to patent employment commercial and environmental matters we believe that we have meritorious defenses against all pending claims and intend to vigorously contest them while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of any pending claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise we believe the potential losses associated with all of these actions are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations

overview 

we design develop manufacture and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test complex electronics in the consumer electronics automotive computing telecommunications and aerospace and defense industries our automatic test equipment products and services include 

 

  

 we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers “idms” outsourced subassembly and test providers “osats” wafer foundries fabless companies that design but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits “ics” manufacturers of circuit boards automotive companies hdd manufacturers aerospace and military contractors as well as the united states department of defense 

the sales of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products these cyclical periods have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry historically these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations this was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 where we saw a significant decrease in revenue in our semiconductor test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy which has negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry the sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 

in response to the business downturn we implemented significant permanent and temporary cost reduction measures we reduced headcount worldwide cut capital spending and imposed temporary salary reductions and furloughs on our workforce 

due to the continued improvement in our business we removed the temporary salary reductions and furloughs we imposed over the last year we believe the permanent costcutting measures we took in the last several quarters will be of long term value in addition we believe our acquisitions of nextest and eagle test and our entry into the high speed memory and hdd markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth we will continue to invest in our business in anticipation of a broader recovery in our markets and to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs as the fourth quarter of 2009 demonstrated with our current cost structure we can achieve significantly higher profitability than we achieved at comparable revenue levels in the past 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories 

  

investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes pensions warranties contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 

our equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 

for multiple element arrangements we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customer’s ability to use the product we defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 60520 “separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts” 

our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product revenue is recognized in accordance with asc 985605 “software revenue recognition” we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements revenue related to the undelivered elements is deferred to the extent that vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for such elements in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

  

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under asc 60535 “revenue recognition constructiontype and productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

inventories 

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provision of asc 71810 “stock compensation”  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods under this transition method stock based compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 includes compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of asc 71810 stockbased compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted after january 1 2006 is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 71810 as required by asc 71810 we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of asc 71810 was not material prior to the adoption of asc 71810 we recognized stockbased compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “apb 25” 

on may 26 2005 our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding unvested “out of the money” stock options awarded to employees officers and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of 1326 the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may 26 2005 and ranged in exercise price from 1373 to 4137 per share as a result of the vesting acceleration options to purchase approximately 76 million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under asc 71810 by approximately 486 million in the aggregate on a pretax basis over fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance as a result of this review undertaken at december 31 2002 we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions most notably the united states due to the continued uncertainty of realization we have maintained our valuation allowance at december 31 2009 and 2008 

  

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 32010 “ investments—debt and equity securities ” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

 we determined that we did not intend to hold certain marketable securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value and recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss in the amount of 07 million and 110 million in the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 primarily related to mortgage and asset backed debt securities 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted asc 82010 “ fair value measurements and disclosures” for financial assets and liabilities as defined in asc 82010 fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants we use the market and income approach techniques to value our financial instruments asc 82010 requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories 

level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets as of the reporting date 

level 2 inputs other than level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly as of the reporting date for example a common approach for valuing fixed income securities is the use of matrix pricing matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices and therefore is considered a level 2 input 

level 3 unobservable inputs that are not supported by market data unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available which might include teradyne’s own data 

as a result of our november 14 2008 acquisition of eagle test we acquired 265 million of auction rate securities “ars” at fair value 300 million par value in addition we acquired 1 the right “ubs put” to sell our ars back to ubs at par plus interest at our sole discretion during a twoyear period beginning on june 30 2010 and 2 received an option to borrow up to 75 of the fair value of the ars at no cost 

beginning in february 2008 and continuing through december 31 2009 the majority of the securities in our acquired ars portfolio have experienced failed auctions resulting in inability to sell these securities consequently as set forth in the trust indentures the coupon rate resets to a contractual rate which may not equal the current market rate a failed auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not necessarily represent a deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer all of our ars are aaa aa or a rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a us department of education agency or a third party insurer at december 31 2009 the underlying securities for the ars have remaining maturities ranging from five to thirty years substantially all of these securities are collateralized by student loans 

because the ubs put is expected to allow us to sell our ars securities at par within a relatively short time period and provides ubs with the ability to require us to sell the securities to them at any time between acceptance of the ubs put through july 2012 we do not anticipate holding these investments to the earlier of maturity or redemption by the issuer we intend to exercise the ubs put and require ubs to repurchase our ars at par at the earliest possible time june 2010 as a result as of the eagle test acquisition date november 14 

  

2008 we classified the ars as trading securities under asc 32010 during 2009 we recorded a net gain of 07 million in interest income and during 2008 we recorded a loss of 05 million in interest expense and other in our consolidated statement of operations for the changes in the ars fair value 

in determining the fair value of our ars and other investments we utilize the provisions of asc 82010 in determining the value of our ars as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we utilized a discounted cash flow valuation model with the major inputs to such model based on our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing these instruments specifically we used the following key inputs to our valuation model as of december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

  

  

  

 based on these key inputs we estimated the fair value of our ars portfolio at 236 million and 260 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

on november 14 2008 we recognized the ubs put as an asset measured at a fair value of 27 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 the fair value of the ubs put was 28 million and 33 million respectively we recorded a 05 million loss in interest expense during 2009 for the decrease in the fair value of the ubs put and a 06 million gain in interest income during 2008 for an increase in the fair value in determining the fair value of the ubs put as of december 31 2009 we assumed we would redeem the auction rate securities at par at the earliest possible time june 30 2010 we utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the ubs put using the following assumptions 1 a time period of 05 years representing the period from december 31 2009 to the earliest date we can expect to be able to redeem the ubs put june 30 2010 and 2 a discount rate of 085 which included a spread based on the credit default swap of ubs in order to account for the credit risk of ubs as of december 31 2008 the following assumptions were used 1 a time period of 15 years and 2 a discount rate of 379 

we have elected fair value treatment for the ubs put under asc 82510 “financial instruments” the ubs put is the only instrument of this nature or type that we hold and for which we have elected the fair value option under asc 82510 

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit 

  

basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

we considered the significant adverse change in the business climate for our products at the end of 2008 a triggering event for testing the recoverability of the carrying amount of our longlived assets based upon a review of the operations and activities associated with our longlived assets we determined that our longlived assets should be grouped with other assets and liabilities and identified four asset groups system on a chiphigh speed memory nextest eagle test and assembly test that resulted in the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we identified developed technology as the primary asset for the nextest and eagle test asset groups test system fixed assets as the primary asset for the system on a chiphigh speed memory asset group and fixed assets as the primary asset for the assembly test asset group 

we tested the recoverability of our asset groups by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to the asset group’s carrying amount the projections utilized in the undiscounted cash flows to test the recoverability of the asset groups were consistent with the underlying projections utilized in our 2008 goodwill impairment evaluation except that the undiscounted cash flows included only the future cash flows directly associated with the direct use and eventual disposition of the asset group the sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the asset groups and as a result the carrying amount of asset groups was deemed recoverable as a result no impairment loss was recognized

on august 1 2007 we completed the sale of the broadband test division to tollgrade communications inc for 113 million in cash broadband test division had revenues for the seven month period ended july 31 2007 of 112 million loss from discontinued operations of our broadband test division for the year ended december 31 2007 was 63 million in 2007 we recorded a gain on the sale of broadband test division of 59 million net of a tax provision of 04 million 

in accordance with asc 36010 we are reporting broadband test division as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this annual report on form 10k unless indicated otherwise the discussion and amounts provided in this “results of operations” section and elsewhere in this form 10k relate to continuing operations only 

book to bill ratio 

book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows 

 

   

revenues 

net revenues for our two reportable segments were as follows 

 

 semiconductor test revenue decreased 3479 million or approximately 39 from 2008 to 2009 due to excess test capacity at our customers as a result of the global economic downturn the eagle test acquisition which was completed in november of 2008 added 610 million of revenue in 2009 compared to 25 million in 2008 

semiconductor test revenue increased 238 million or approximately 3 from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to 794 million of sales from our nextest acquisition partially offset by lower sales due to decreased demand related to soc device units growing at a lower rate in 2008 compared to 2007 

the increase in systems test group revenue of 603 million or approximately 29 from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to sales of hard disk drive test systems partially offset by a decrease in commercial board test and diagnostic solutions sales while milaero product and service sales remained flat 

systems test group revenue decreased 191 million or approximately 8 from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to a lower milaero board test programrelated sales 

our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years 

 

 net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue was as follows 

 

 the breakout of product and service revenue for the past three years was as follows 

 

   

our product revenue decreased 2407 million or 29 in 2009 from 2008 due to lower sales across all semiconductor test commercial board test and diagnostic solutions products as a result of excess test capacity at our customers due to the global economic downturn the decrease was partially offset by sales of hard disk drive test systems the eagle test acquisition which was completed in november of 2008 added 526 million of product revenue in 2009 service revenue which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support decreased 469 million or 17 due to the global economic downturn 

our product revenue decreased 256 million or 3 in 2008 from 2007 due to decreased demand service revenue increased 303 million or 13 due to a larger installed base 

in 2009 revenues from one customer accounted for approximately 12 of total revenue in 2008 and 2007 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenue 

in 2009 2008 and 2007 our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 26 14 and 16 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

gross profit 

 

 gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2008 to 2009 by 70 percentage points this decrease in gross profit was the result of a decrease of 52 points due to lower product sales volume a decrease of 41 points related to higher product revenue as a percentage of total revenue which included the growth of hard disk drive test system revenues and a decrease of 15 points for a charge to adjust eagle test acquired inventory to fair value these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 38 points primarily from lower operations spending due to workforce reductions and lower freight and warranty charges which were the result of lower product sales 

gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2007 to 2008 by 16 percentage points a decrease of 25 points was due to a 276 million increase in provision for excess inventory recorded as a result of the significant decrease in forecasted semiconductor demand coupled with a product transition this decrease was partially offset by improved service margins in our semiconductor test group 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

  

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded an inventory provision of 280 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

  

 of the 280 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2009 203 million was related to semiconductor test and 77 million was related to systems test group 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded an inventory provision of 294 million included in cost of revenues due to the following factors 

 

  

 of the 294 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2008 249 million was related to semiconductor test and 45 million was related to systems test group 

the provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 was 18 million of the 18 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 05 million related to semiconductor test and 13 million related to systems test group 

during the year ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we scrapped 316 million 98 million and 335 million of inventory respectively and sold 43 million 24 million and 11 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2009 we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1297 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

  

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 the decrease of 517 million in engineering and development expenses from 2008 to 2009 was mainly due to a 549 million decrease in spending as a result of workforce reductions and lower project spending and a 62 million decrease due to temporary salary reductions this decrease was partially offset by additional costs of 94 million related to the acquisition of eagle test 

the increase of 122 million in engineering and development expenses from 2007 to 2008 was mainly due to an increase of 103 million in spending related to investments in adjacent markets an increase of 129 million due to the acquisition of nextest and eagle test partially offset by a decrease in other semiconductor test spending primarily related to headcount reduction of 83 million and lower variable employee compensation of 28 million 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the decrease in selling and administrative spending of 474 million from 2008 to 2009 is due primarily to a 573 million decrease from workforce reductions and ongoing cost reduction initiatives and a 99 million decrease due to temporary salary reductions partially offset by additional costs of 198 million related to the acquisition of eagle test 

the decrease in selling and administrative spending of 03 million from 2007 to 2008 consists primarily of the following 147 million decrease due to lower labor costs from reductions in headcount 70 million decrease due to lower variable employee compensation partially offset by 185 million increase due to the acquisition of nextest and 30 million increase related to the acquisition of eagle test 

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2008 to 2009 due to the eagle test acquisition which was completed in november of 2008 acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2007 to 2008 due to the acquisitions of nextest and eagle test 

  

goodwill impairment 

in 2008 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 3297 million we experienced a worsening in our demand outlook during the fourth quarter of 2008 this sharp decline led to a noncash impairment of our goodwill of 3297 million as of december 31 2008 

inprocess research and development 

in 2008 we recorded an expense of 16 million related to inprocess research and development related to the acquisition of nextest and eagle test 

on march 7 2007 we purchased inprocess enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from mosaid technologies inc for 176 million which includes 06 million in fees directly related to the acquisition of the purchase price 167 million has been allocated to inprocess research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations the balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets in the year ended december 31 2008 as a result of a workforce reduction we recorded an impairment charge of 06 million to writeoff the acquired workforce asset

in response to a downturn in the industry we implemented restructuring activities across all segments to reduce costs principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations the remaining accrual for severance and benefits of 29 million is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by the end of the first quarter of 2010 the remaining accrual for lease payments of 105 million on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the longterm other accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2013 we expect to pay approximately 35 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months our future lease commitments as of december 31 2009 are net of expected sublease income of 58 million as of december 31 2009 we have subleased approximately 54 of our unoccupied space 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded restructuring charges of 379 million related to 2009 activities as part of ongoing efforts to lower expenses and our cost structure in light of the industry wide decline in orders for semiconductor equipment and a credit of 04 million due to a change in sublease income estimate related to q208 activity the restructuring charges credit recorded in 2009 consisted of the following activities

interest and other 

 

 interest income decreased by 92 million from 126 million in 2008 to 34 million in 2009 due primarily to lower cash balances as a result of the acquisitions of nextest and eagle test and lower interest rates interest income decreased by 265 million from 391 million in 2007 to 126 million in 2008 due primarily to lower cash balances as a result of the acquisitions of nextest and eagle test and stock repurchase activity 

interest expense and other increased by 94 million from 142 million in 2008 to 236 million in 2009 due primarily to the following 139 million of interest expense related to our convertible senior notes 25 million related to the write off of the remaining revolving credit facility debt issue costs due to the termination of our revolving credit facility agreement an increase of 12 million in interest expense related to the revolving credit facility partially offset by a decrease of 126 million in losses on marketable securities in 2008 interest expense and other included 28 million for the gain on sale of an equity investment and a 13 million life insurance gain 

loss income from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

 the decrease in loss from continuing operations before income taxes from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2008 lower spending and lower restructuring and other costs in 2009 compared to 2008 partially offset by lower revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2008 and increased restructuring and other costs in 2008 compared to 2007 

income taxes 

the income tax benefit from continuing operations of 88 million for 2009 was primarily due to federal net operating loss carryback claims the income tax expense from continuing operations for 2008 and 2007 of 126 and 74 million respectively related primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

  

  liquidity and capital resources 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased 1445 million in 2009 from 2008 to 5188 million cash activity for 2009 2008 and 2007 was as follows in millions 

 

   

in 2009 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired provided cash of 785 million this was due to a decrease in operating assets of 471 million and an increase in operating liabilities of 314 million the decrease in operating assets consisted mainly of a decrease in inventory of 634 million partially offset by an increase of 156 million in accounts receivable due to higher sales volume the increase in operating liabilities consisted of an increase in advanced customer payments accounts payable deferred revenue and other accrued expenses of 467 million partially offset by retirement plan contributions of 153 million the 464 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advances in 2009 is due to an advanced payment of approximately 682 million received from one of our semiconductor test customers the customer received an incremental discount and also wanted to secure its position in our manufacturing slot plan this increase in customer advances was partially offset by a 218 million decrease in deferred revenue 

investing activities in 2009 used cash of 939 million due to investments in property plant and equipment of 419 million payment of transaction fees related to the eagle test acquisition of 37 million and purchases of marketable securities of 904 million partially offset by sales of marketable securities that provided cash of 410 million and proceeds from life insurance policies that provided cash of 11 million 

during 2009 financing activities provided cash of 661 million due to approximately 1630 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior convertible notes 100 million of longterm debt proceeds from a loan in japan and 157 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans these increases were partially offset by 1225 million of cash used for the repayment of our revolving credit facility and 11 million of cash used for principal payment on longterm debt 

on april 6 2009 we completed a registered public offering of 1900 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes “notes” and settled the related convertible bond hedge and warrant transaction and received approximately 1630 million as a result of these financing transactions the notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year the first interest payment was on september 15 2009 the notes will mature on march 15 2014 unless earlier repurchased by us or converted the notes may be converted under certain circumstances and during certain periods at an initial conversion rate of approximately 18265 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 548 the convertible note hedge and warrant transaction will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the notes to approximately 767 per share of our common stock representing a 75 conversion premium based upon the closing price of our common stock on march 31 2009 we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity holders of the notes may require us to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the company 

in 2008 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired provided cash of 386 million this was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable of 1182 million as a result of a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a decrease in days sales outstanding from 66 days in 2007 to 51 days in 2008 as a result of improved collections this was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accruals of 316 million and an increase in other assets of 327 million 

  

in 2007 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired used cash of 442 million this was due to a number of factors including an increase in accounts receivable of 337 million due to an increase in days sales outstanding from 55 days in 2006 to 66 days in 2007 a reduction of accrued income taxes of 309 million due to the payments of 2006 foreign income taxes around the world and an increase in other assets of 250 million primarily related to balances due for inventory provided to our outsourced subcontract manufacturer of 157 million these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in our inventory balances due to shorter cycle times for our flex products 

in 2008 investing activities used cash of 4491 million and in 2007 investing activities provided cash of 1166 million in 2008 we completed the acquisition of nextest and eagle test for a total cash purchase price and related fees net of cash acquired of 5743 million in march 2007 we bought an enabling technology from mosaid technologies inc for a purchase price and related costs totaling 176 million capital expenditures were 872 million in 2008 and 861 million in 2007 proceeds from asset disposals were 617 million and 88 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively and primarily consisted of sales of real estate investing activities of discontinued operations provided 108 million of cash in 2007 included in this balance are the net proceeds we received related to the sale of our broadband test division to tollgrade communications inc in august 2007 

in 2008 financing activities provided cash of 463 million and in 2007 financing activities used cash of 2505 million in november of 2008 we obtained a revolving credit facility that provided net cash of 1197 million the credit facility had a three year term that was to end on november 14 2011 as of december 31 2008 the outstanding balance under the credit facility was 1225 million the credit facility contained customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants including the financial measures of a leverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio and an available domestic cash to total revolving borrowings ratio as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility on april 7 2009 we repaid and terminated our revolving credit facility agreement we used approximately 1233 million of the net proceeds of the convertible senior notes transaction to repay 1225 million of principal and 08 million of accrued interest outstanding under the revolving credit facility agreement 

during 2008 and 2007 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans provided cash of 178 million and 232 million respectively 

in july 2006 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program which was completed in october 2007 in total 4000 million of common stock was repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions during 2007 we repurchased 183 million shares of common stock for 2737 million for an average price per share of 1494 in november 2007 our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase program allowing us to spend an aggregate of 4000 million to repurchase shares of our common stock during 2008 we repurchased 75 million shares of common stock for 912 million at an average price of 1220 per share as of november 4 2008 the board of directors suspended the stock repurchase program 

we operate in a highly cyclical industry and we may experience with relatively short notice significant fluctuations in demand for our products this could result in a material effect on our liquidity position we expect that our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of 5188 million will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

we adopted the funded status recognition provision of asc 71520 “compensation – retirement benefits – defined benefit plans” effective december 31 2006 asc 71520 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 71520 the pension asset or liability 

  

represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 90 million including a settlement charge of 16 million and a curtailment gain of 06 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the largest portion of our 2009 pension expense was 28 million for our supplemental executive defined benefit plan pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 775 was an appropriate rate to use for 2009 we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust the rate as necessary the current asset allocation for our us qualified pension plan is 460 invested in equity securities 426 invested in fixed income securities and 114 invested in other securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 

we base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2009 under the us qualified pension plan we had cumulative losses of approximately 347 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the plan’s expected cash flows and was 585 at december 31 2009 down from 62 at december 31 2008 we estimate that in 2010 we will recognize approximately 33 million of pension expense for the us qualified pension plan the pension expense estimate for 2010 is based on a 585 discount rate and 75 return on plan assets future pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans as of december 31 2009 we had unrecognized pension losses and prior service costs of 1366 million of which 1207 million is for the us qualified pension plan 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the potential change in our us qualified pension plan expense for the year ending december 31 2010 that would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 

 

 the assets of the us qualified pension plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities the value of our us qualified pension plan assets has increased from 1845 million at december 31 2008 to 

  

2171 million at december 31 2009 our funding policy is to make contributions to the pension plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2009 we made a discretionary contribution of 75 million to the us qualified pension plan 15 million contribution to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and 34 million contribution to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries on february 18 2010 we made a discretionary contribution of 50 million to the us qualified pension plan and we expect to contribute approximately 15 million to the us supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan in 2010 contributions that will be made in 2010 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately 33 million 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in “note n stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have the 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 the 2006 equity plan replaced our 1996 nonemployee director stock option plan our 1997 employee stock option plan and our 1991 employee stock option plan each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 equity plan we may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise vesting or expiration as applicable 

at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 28 2009 our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 100 million for an aggregate of 220 million shares issuable thereunder and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 50 million for an aggregate of 254 million shares issuable thereunder 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2009 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

      

   the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers directors consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2009 was 12652940 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 24 2016 in 2009 we granted restricted stock units to employees and directors and restricted stock units and stock options to executive officers in 2008 we only issued restricted stock unit awards to our employees executive officers and directors 

as of december 31 2009 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested awards and options totaled 388 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 18 years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies all of our auction rate marketable securities are aaa aa or a rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a us department of education agency or a third party insurer our fixed income availableforsale marketable securities purchased during 2009 and held as of december 31 2009 have a minimum rating of aa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in euro british pound japanese yen and the taiwan dollar these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10 fluctuation in interest rates was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio on these bases the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of december 31 2009 and 06 million as of december 31 2008

see also “item 1a risk factors” and “note s operating segment and geographic information” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments these competitors include among others advantest corporation verigy inc and ltx–credence corporation some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2008 and 2007 our backlog of unfilled orders in our two reportable segments was as follows 

 

   

of the backlog at december 31 2008 approximately 89 of the semiconductor test backlog and 84 of systems test group backlog is expected to be delivered in 2009 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers certain of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers’ delays or ceases to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we employed approximately 3800 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances we have no collective bargaining contracts 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were 2165 million 2043 million and 2024 million respectively these expenditures amounted to approximately 20 19 and 15 of consolidated net revenue in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated the amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of investigation estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing site conditions and environmental remediation laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

the risks described below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles which are difficult to predict 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies and resulting reductions in customer capital investments the duration of slowdowns in customer capital investments are difficult to predict 

the global economy and financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others governments have taken historic actions intended to address extreme market conditions that include severely restricted credit there may be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets credit availability and adverse economic conditions throughout the world these economic developments affect businesses such as ours and those of our customers and vendors in a number of ways that could result in unfavorable consequences to us further disruption and deterioration in economic conditions may further reduce customer purchases of our products thereby reducing our revenues and earnings in addition such adverse economic conditions may among other things result in increased price competition for our products increased risk of excess and obsolete 

  

inventories increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues we are taking actions to address the effects of the current economic crisis including implementing cost control and reduction measures such as the reduction in force we announced on january 28 2009 it is possible that we may experience difficulties in successfully implementing these cost controls and reduction measures in a timely manner or at all and that we may experience delays and unexpected costs and expenses in implementing the reduction plan because of these and other factors we cannot predict whether these cost control and reduction measures will be sufficient to offset certain of the negative trends that might affect our business 

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics which historically has been highly cyclical 

our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products as evidenced by our current business and results of operations the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems we manufacture and market we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we cannot assure that the level of revenues or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the current economic environment has adversely affected our business financial condition and operating results we are actively taking steps to minimize the impact of this downturn but we cannot be certain those steps will have the desired impact or of how long the downturn will continue and when our results will improve if at all 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability 

the following factors are expected to impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependant upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements many of our suppliers have implemented cost reduction strategies just as we have to address the slowdowns in the market it may be difficult for these suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform 

we depend on flextronics international ltd “flextronics” to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china if for any reason flextronics cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time difficulties their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse affect on our operations which could result in a decline in our stock price 

  

we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisition of nextest systems corporation eagle test systems inc and other businesses that we may acquire or strategic alliances that we may form in the future 

in january 2008 we acquired nextest systems corporation and in november 2008 we acquired eagle test systems inc we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of nextest systems corporation eagle test systems inc and other businesses or technologies that we may acquire in addition the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies we cannot assure you that following an acquisition we will achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs or restructuring charges or in the future impairment of goodwill that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means 

we may need additional financing which could be difficult to obtain  

we expect based upon our current estimate of our revenue and operating results for fiscal year 2009 that our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of 3743 million will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months if our estimates of revenue and operating results for fiscal year 2009 significantly decrease we could be required to obtain additional financing however if financing is necessary we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such financing or that the terms will be acceptable to us in addition financings may place restrictions on how we operate our business if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms if and when needed we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services take advantage of future opportunities grow our business or respond to competitive pressures which could adversely harm our business 

restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our senior credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies 

the agreement governing our senior credit facility limits our ability among other things to incur additional indebtedness sell transfer license or dispose of assets consolidate or merge enter into transactions with our affiliates and incur liens in addition our senior credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest such as subject to permitted exceptions making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds making investments loans and other advances and prepaying our other indebtedness while our indebtedness under our senior credit facility is outstanding our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness 

we have taken measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products which could have longterm negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 

we have taken and continue to take measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products these measures include shifting more of our operations to lower cost regions outsourcing manufacturing processes divesting of certain businesses implementing material cost reduction programs reducing both the number of our employees and the compensation paid to our employees and reducing planned capital expenditures and expense budgets we cannot assure that the measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete to operate effectively to operate 

  

profitably during slowdowns or to effectively meet a rapid increase in customer demand these measures may have longterm negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in our products making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and to quickly respond to customers or competitors in an upward cycle 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or costs including penalties or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2008 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations and financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

for example in connection with our august 2000 acquisition of each of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc a complaint was filed on or about september 5 2001 by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of our then executive officers additionally in 2001 we were designated as a “potentially responsible party” at a cleanup site in los angeles california and in 2008 we were notified of potential liability relating to contamination at a disposal site in west covina california both of these claims also arise out of our acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated october 20 1992 these matters are further described in “item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 

we receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others in october 2008 we were served with patent infringement litigation from xyratex technology ltd “xyratex” the xyratex matter is further described in “item 3 legal proceedings” an assertion of patent infringement against us such as the xyratex suit if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our new hard disk drive testing product or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such product so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical additionally patent litigation such as the xyratex suit could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense even if we eventually prevail if we do not prevail we might be forced to pay significant damages obtain licenses modify our products or stop making our products each of which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and operating results 

we have significant guarantees and indemnification obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results for additional information see “note k commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products “ip” in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or require a significant use of management resources and necessitate a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect our operating results 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact our business 

acts of war and terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees facilities customers suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as we our outsourced manufacturing providers and our suppliers sell and manufacture products both in the united states and internationally the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at these locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business such conflicts may 

  

also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems we have completed some emergency preparedness planning and have a business continuity plan in case some of these events occur however we cannot be certain that our plans will be effective in the event of a disaster or other situation all of these conditions make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

during 2007 we made several important corporate governance changes which included declassification of our board of directors adoption of majority voting standard for the election of our directors and early termination of our shareholder rights plan despite these changes there are still provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 11 2008 xyratex technology ltd “xyratex” filed a complaint against us in the united states federal district court in los angeles california alleging that certain of our disk drive test products infringe one of xyratex’s patents the complaint was served on teradyne on october 29 2008 the suit seeks temporary preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as unspecified monetary damages including treble damages for patent infringement on december 17 2008 we filed our answer and counterclaims denying that our disk drive test products infringe the asserted xyratex patent and asking the court to declare such patent invalid the case is currently in the discovery phase and trial is scheduled to begin in november 2009 we intend to vigorously defend against the xyratex claim and to vigorously pursue our counterclaims against xyratex 

on september 5 2001 after our august 2000 acquisition of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc the former owners of those companies filed a complaint against teradyne and two of our then executive officers in the federal district court in san diego california asserting securities fraud and breach of contract related to the acquisition the district court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs’ claims granted partial summary judgment against them with respect to their breach of contract claim and denied their motion for reconsideration in july 2007 after an appeal by the plaintiffs the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court rulings we petitioned the ninth circuit for rehearing which was denied and the case was remanded back to the district court on august 29 2008 the district court granted teradyne’s motion for judgment on the pleadings on september 11 2008 the plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal 

in 2001 we were designated as a potentially responsible party “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arose out of our acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement in 1992 neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site we have asked the state of california to drop the prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so 

in november 2008 we received a general notice letter from the california department of toxic substances control “dtsc” which informed us of potential liability with respect to contamination at the bkk corporation landfill facility site in west covina california similar to the prp claim discussed above this claim arose out of our acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 neither we nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the west covina site we have asked the dtsc and the group of settling defendants to remove us as a prp for this site 

we believe that we have meritorious defenses against the above unsettled claims and intend to vigorously contest them while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of the unsettled claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise we believe the potential losses associated with all of these actions are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations and of cash flows of any one period 

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as but not limited to patent employment commercial and environmental matters although there can be no assurance there are no such matters pending that we expect to be material with respect to our business financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the historical information contained in this document the discussion in this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements made pursuant to section 21e of the exchange act that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans expectations and intentions the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as being applicable to all related forwardlooking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forwardlooking statements factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in “item 1a risk factors” and elsewhere herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

  

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes pensions warranties contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 

our equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 

for multiple element arrangements we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customer’s ability to use the product we defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” technical bulletin 901 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 

our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop no 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for such elements in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered vsoe is 

  

the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

inventories 

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provision of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “share based payment” “sfas 123r” using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods under this transition method stock based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 includes compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stock based compensation” “sfas 123” stockbased compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted after january 1 2006 is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of sfas 123r as required by sfas 123r we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of sfas 123r was not material 

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r we recognized stockbased compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “apb 25” in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” regarding the sec’s interpretation of sfas 123r and the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies we have applied provisions of sab 107 in our adoption of sfas 123r 

on may 26 2005 our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding unvested “out of the money” stock options awarded to employees officers and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of 1326 the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may 26 2005 and ranged in exercise price from 1373 to 4137 per share as a result of the vesting acceleration options to purchase approximately 76 million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under sfas 123r by approximately 486 million in the aggregate on a pretax basis over fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance as a result of this review undertaken at december 31 2002 we concluded under 

  

applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions most notably the united states due to the continued uncertainty of realization we have maintained our valuation allowance at december 31 2008 and 2007 

investments 

we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” “sfas no 115” and fasb staff position nos fas 1151 and fas 1241 the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential otherthantemporary impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is otherthantemporary include 

 

  

  

 we have determined that we do not intend to hold certain marketable securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value and recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss in the amount of 110 million in the year ended december 31 2008 primarily related to mortgage and asset backed debt securities 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” for financial assets and liabilities as defined in sfas no 157 fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants we use the market and income approach techniques to value our financial instruments sfas no 157 requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories 

level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets as of the reporting date 

level 2 inputs other than level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly as of the reporting date for example a common approach for valuing fixed income securities is the use of matrix pricing matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices and therefore is considered a level 2 input 

level 3 unobservable inputs that are not supported by market data unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available which might include teradyne’s own data 

as a result of our november 14 2008 acquisition of eagle test we acquired 265 million of auction rate securities ars at fair value 300 million par value in addition we acquired 1 the right “ubs put” to sell our ars back to ubs at par plus interest at our sole discretion during a twoyear period beginning on june 30 2010 and 2 received an option to borrow up to 75 of the fair value of the ars at no cost 

beginning in february 2008 and continuing through december 31 2008 the securities in our acquired ars portfolio have experienced failed auctions resulting in inability to sell these securities consequently as set forth in the trust indentures the coupon rate resets to a contractual rate which may not equal the current market rate a failed auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not necessarily represent a deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer all of our ars are aaa aa or a rated by one or more of the major credit rating 

  

agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a us department of education agency or a third party insurer at december 31 2008 the underlying securities for the ars have remaining maturities ranging from five to thirtyone years substantially all of these securities are collateralized by student loans the estimated fair value of our ars portfolio was 260 million as of december 31 2008 

because the ubs put is expected to allow us to sell our ars securities at par within a relatively short time horizon and provides ubs with the ability to require us to sell the securities to them at any time between acceptance of the ubs put through july 2012 we do not anticipate holding these investments to the earlier of maturity or redemption by the issuer we intend to exercise the ubs put and require ubs to repurchase our ars at par at the earliest possible time june 2010 as a result as of the eagle test acquisition date november 14 2008 we classified the ars as trading securities under sfas no 115 during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded a loss of 05 million in interest expense and other net in our consolidated statement of operations for the decrease in the ars fair value from november 14 2008 to december 31 2008 future changes in fair value of the ars will be recorded in operating results 

in determining the fair value of our ars and other investments we utilize the provisions of sfas no 157 in determining the value of our ars as of december 31 2008 we utilized a discounted cash flow valuation model with the major inputs to such model based on our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing these instruments specifically we used the following key inputs to our valuation model 

 

  

  

  

 based on these key inputs we estimated the fair value of our ars portfolio was 260 million as of december 31 2008 representing a 05 million decrease in fair value since november 14 2008 our ars securities and the related put option were the only investments as of december 31 2008 in which we utilized level 3 valuation techniques under sfas no 157 

on november 14 2008 we recognized the ubs put as an asset measured at a fair value of 27 million at december 31 2008 the fair value of the ubs put was 33 million we recorded a 06 million gain in interest income during the fourth quarter of 2008 for the increase in the fair value of the ubs put since november 14 2008 in determining the fair value of the ubs put as of december 31 2008 we assumed we would redeem the auction rate securities at par at the earliest possible time june 30 2010 we utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the ubs put using the following assumptions 1 a time period of 15 years representing the period from december 31 2008 to the earliest date we can expect to be able to redeem the ubs put june 30 2010 and 2 a discount rate of 379 which included a spread based on the credit default swap of ubs in order to account for the credit risk of ubs 

we have elected fair value treatment for the ubs put under sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas no 159” the ubs put is the only instrument of its naturetype that we hold and for which we have elected the fair value option under sfas no 159 

  

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

we determined that the worsening in our demand outlook experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 was a significant event that indicated that the carrying amount of certain longlived and intangible asset groups might not be recoverable we conducted recoverability tests in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas no 144” as the undiscounted future cash flows of the longlived asset groups exceeded their carrying amount we determined that no impairment of our longlived assets had occurred at december 31 2008

statements of operations 

 

 results of operations 

discontinued operations 

on august 1 2007 we completed the sale of the broadband test division to tollgrade for 113 million in cash broadband test division had revenues for the seven month period ended july 31 2007 of 112 million 

  

and for the year ended december 31 2006 of 206 million loss from discontinued operations of our broadband test division for the year ended december 31 2007 was 63 million and loss for the year ended december 31 2006 was 56 million in 2007 we recorded a gain on the sale of broadband test division of 59 million net of a tax provision of 04 million 

in accordance with sfas 144 we are reporting broadband test division as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this annual report on form 10k unless indicated otherwise the discussion and amounts provided in this “results of operations” section and elsewhere in this form 10k relate to continuing operations only 

bookings 

net bookings for our two reportable segments were as follows 

 

 the semiconductor test business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for test equipment which historically has been highly cyclical semiconductor test bookings decreased 1316 million or 15 from 2007 to 2008 due primarily to lower demand across all customer groups in 2008 nextest contributed 676 million of bookings and eagle test contributed 10 million of bookings 

the semiconductor test bookings decreased 1129 million or 11 from 2006 to 2007 due to lower demand across a wide range of end markets applications and geographies as soc device units grew at a lower rate in 2007 than in 2006 the lower demand in soc market was lessened by our increase in soc market share during 2007 by approximately 2 to 3 points 

systems test group bookings increased 33 million or 2 from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to an increase in milaero board test program related bookings partially offset by decreases in commercial board test and diagnostic solutions 

systems test group bookings decreased 623 million or 23 from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to decreases across all business units diagnostic solutions orders are program related and have significant fluctuations there was a large program rollout in 2006 for the vehicle measurement module product line milaero bookings are also often program related and there was also a significant military program that took place in 2006 commercial board test bookings decreased in 2007 due to a contraction in the size of the ict market 

order cancellations and backlog adjustments for our two reportable segments for the last three years were as follows 

 

 customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties in 2008 2007 and 2006 there were no significant cancellation penalties received 

  

due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

net bookings by region as a percentage of our total net bookings were as follows 

 

 for the past three years our backlog of unfilled orders for our two reportable segments was as follows 

 

 revenue 

net revenues for our two reportable segments were as follows 

 

 semiconductor test revenue increased 238 million or 3 from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to 794 million of sales from our nextest acquisition partially offset by lower sales due to decreased demand due to soc device units growing at a lower rate in 2008 compared to 2007 

semiconductor test revenue decreased 2124 million or 20 from 2006 to 2007 due to soc device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006 this resulted in decreased demand across a wide range of end markets applications and geographies the lower demand rate was lessened by an increase in soc market share during 2007 by approximately 2 to 3 points 

systems test group revenue decreased 191 million or 8 from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to a lower milaero board test programrelated sales 

systems test group revenue decreased 415 million or 16 from 2006 to 2007 due to decreased sales in diagnostic solutions the decrease was related to a large program rollout for the vehicle measurement module product line that took place in 2006 and was concluded in 2007 

  

our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years 

 

 net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue was as follows 

 

 the breakout of product and service revenue for the past three years was as follows 

 

 our product revenue decreased 256 million or 3 in 2008 from 2007 due to decreased demand service revenue which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support increased 303 million or 13 due to a larger installed base 

our product revenue decreased 2572 million or 23 in 2007 from 2006 due to soc device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006 service revenue increased 33 million or 1 in 2007 from 2006 

in the past three years no single customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net revenue in 2008 2007 and 2006 our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 14 16 and 18 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

gross profit 

 

   

gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2007 to 2008 by 16 percentage points a decrease of 25 points was due to a 276 million increase in provision for excess and obsolete inventory recorded as a result of the significant decrease in forecasted semiconductor demand coupled with a product transition this decrease was partially offset by improved service margins in our semiconductor test group 

gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2006 to 2007 by 15 percentage points a reduction in semiconductor test sales volume contributed to a decrease of 15 points a shift in product mix primarily related to higher service revenue as a percentage of total revenue contributed to a decrease of 2 points these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 1 point related to lower semiconductor test inventory provision in 2007 and an increase of 1 point resulting from lower fixed costs and employee compensation across both segments 

the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value 

the provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 was 294 million of the 294 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 249 million was related to semiconductor test and 45 million was related to systems test group 

the provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 was 18 million of the 18 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 05 million related to semiconductor test and 13 million related to systems test group 

the provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 was 128 million of the 128 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 115 million related to semiconductor test including an 80 million provision for the writedown of excess nonflex inventory and 13 million related to systems test group 

during the year ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we scrapped 13 million 335 million and 295 million of inventory respectively and sold 24 million 11 million and 28 million of previously writtendown or writtenoff inventory respectively as of december 31 2008 we have inventory related reserves for amounts which had been writtendown or writtenoff totaling 1249 million we have no predetermined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory 

  

engineering and development 

engineering and development expenses were as follows 

 

 the increase of 122 million or 6 in engineering and development expenses from 2007 to 2008 was mainly due to an increase of 103 million in spending related to investments in adjacent markets an increase of 129 million due to the acquisition of nextest and eagle test partially offset by a decrease in other semiconductor test spending primarily related to headcount reduction of 83 million and lower variable employee compensation of 28 million 

the increase of 19 million or 1 in engineering and development expenses from 2006 to 2007 was due in part to a 103 million increase in spending related to new products and entry into adjacent markets primarily in the semiconductor test segment this was partially offset by lower variable employee compensation of 84 million 

selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

 the decrease in selling and administrative spending of 03 million from 2007 to 2008 consists of the following 147 million decrease due to lower labor costs from reductions in headcount 70 million decrease due to lower variable employee compensation partially offset by 185 million increase due to the acquisition of nextest and 30 million increase related to the acquisition of eagle test 

the decrease in selling and administrative spending of 307 million or 11 from 2006 to 2007 consists of the following 135 million decrease due to lower variable employee compensation 172 million decrease due to lower transition expenses including the consolidation of facilities in massachusetts and costs associated with the outsourcing of certain information technology functions both of which occurred in 2006 

acquired intangible assets amortization 

acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows 

 

 acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2007 to 2008 due to the acquisitions of nextest and eagle test 

goodwill impairment 

in 2008 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 3333 million we experienced a worsening in our demand outlook during the fourth quarter of 2008 this sharp decline is not expected to recover in the near term consequently this has led to an impairment of our goodwill of 3333 million as of december 31 2008 

  

inprocess research and development 

in 2008 we recorded an expense of 16 million related to inprocess research and development related to the acquisition of nextest and eagle test 

on march 7 2007 we purchased inprocess enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from mosaid technologies inc for 176 million which includes 06 million in fees directly related to the acquisition of the purchase price 167 million has been allocated to inprocess research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations the balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets in the year ended december 31 2008 as a result of a workforce reduction teradyne recorded an impairment charge of 06 million to writeoff the acquired workforce asset 

restructuring and other net 

in response to a downturn in the industry we initiated restructuring activities across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations the tables below represent activities related to these actions the remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid in 2009 the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the longterm other accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2013 we expect to pay out approximately 24 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months our future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of 77 million as of december 31 2008 we have subleased approximately 64 of our unoccupied space as of december 31 2008 

2008 activities 

 

 we recorded the following activities related to the 2008 restructuring activities 

 

  

  

   

  

 the restructuring actions taken during the year ended december 31 2008 are expected to generate quarterly cost savings of approximately 112 million across all segments

pre2006 activities 

 

 for pre2006 restructuring activity we recorded the following activity in 2008 

 

 interest and other net 

 

 the interest income decreased by 265 million from 391 million in 2007 to 126 million in 2008 due primarily to lower cash balances as a result of the acquisition of nextest and eagle test and stock repurchase activity the interest income decrease of 55 million from 446 million in 2006 to 391 million in 2007 was primarily attributable to lower cash balances due to the stock repurchase activity in 2007 

the increase in interest expense and other net of 131 million from 11 million in 2007 to 142 million in 2008 was due primarily to recognizing otherthantemporary losses related to marketable securities and realized losses from sales of marketable securities the decrease in interest expense and other net of 105 million from 116 million in 2006 to 11 million in 2007 was due primarily to the repayment of our 375 senior convertible notes in the fourth quarter of 2006 

loss income from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

 the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2008 and increased restructuring and other costs in 2008 compared to 2007 

  

the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2006 to 2007 was mainly due to the 20 reduction in revenue in the semiconductor test segment which was a result of soc device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in corporate from 2006 to 2007 is primarily related to the elimination of our interest expense due to the repayment of our notes in 2006 and gains from sales of real estate which totaled 36 million 

income taxes 

the income tax expense from continuing operations for 2008 and 2007 totaled 126 million and 74 million respectively the expense relates primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes during 2006 the income tax expense from continuing operations totaled 279 million the expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes offset by benefits from a 60 million credit related to us pension funding and the settlement of a california income tax audit for 1998 through 2000 

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased 3686 million in 2008 from 2007 to 3743 million cash activity for 2008 2007 and 2006 was as follows in millions 

 

   

in 2008 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired provided cash of 386 million this was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable of 1182 million due to a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a decrease in days sales outstanding from 66 days in 2007 to 51 days in 2008 as a result of improved collections this was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accruals of 344 million and an increase in other assets of 299 million 

in 2007 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired used cash of 442 million this was due to a number of factors including an increase in accounts receivable of 337 million due to an increase in days sales outstanding from 55 days in 2006 to 66 days in 2007 a reduction of accrued income taxes of 309 million due to the payments of 2006 foreign income taxes around the world and an increase in other assets of 250 million primarily related to balances due for inventory provided to our outsourced subcontract manufacturer of 157 million these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in our inventory balances due to shorter cycle times with our flex products 

in 2006 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired provided cash of 1691 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable balances of 679 million resulting mostly from the decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 additionally there was a decrease in inventory of 793 million due to shorter cycle times with our flex products and an increase of 328 million in accrued income taxes due to higher foreign income taxes in 2006 compared to 2005 these providers of cash were partially offset by retirement plan contributions of 302 million of which 200 million was a contribution to our us qualified pension plan 

investing activities consist of purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities cash paid for acquisitions of businesses or technology proceeds from the sale of land and buildings proceeds from asset and product line disposals cash paid for purchases of capital assets in 2008 we completed the acquisition of nextest and eagle test for a total cash purchase price and related fees net of cash acquired of 5743 million in march 2007 we bought an enabling technology from mosaid technologies inc for a purchase price and related costs totaling 176 million capital expenditures were 872 million in 2008 861 million in 2007 and 1100 million in 2006 capital expenditures decreased by 239 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a decrease of internally manufactured systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in semiconductor test of approximately 181 million the remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across teradyne proceeds from asset disposals were 617 million 88 million and 850 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and primarily consist of sales of real estate investing activities of discontinued operations provided 108 million of cash in 2007 included in this balance is the net proceeds we received related to the sale of our broadband test division to tollgrade in august 2007 

financing activities include proceeds from revolving credit facility issuance of our common stock repurchases of our common stock as well as repayments of debt 

in november of 2008 we obtained a revolving credit facility that provided net cash of 1197 million the credit facility will be available on a revolving basis until november 14 2011 as of december 31 2008 the outstanding balance under the credit facility was 1225 million we may optionally prepay loans or reduce the credit facility commitments at any time without penalty borrowings under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of teradyne currently nextest and eagle test the obligations of teradyne and the guarantors are collateralized by i all personal property of teradyne and each guarantor ii all present and future shares of capital stock of or other ownership or profit interest in each of teradyne’s present and future subsidiaries limited to 65 of the capital stock of each firsttier foreign subsidiary and iii all real property of teradyne and each guarantor if the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated indebtedness for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 25 to 10 the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants including the financial measures of a leverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio and an available domestic cash to total revolving borrowings ratio as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility 

  

during 2008 2007 and 2006 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans provided cash of 178 million 232 million and 233 million respectively 

in july 2006 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program which was completed in october 2007 in total 400 million of common stock was repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions during 2006 we repurchased 106 million shares of common stock for 1378 million for an average price per share of 1298 during 2007 we repurchased 183 million shares of common stock for 2737 million for an average price per share of 1494 in november 2007 our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase program allowing us to spend an aggregate of 400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock during 2008 we repurchased 75 million shares of common stock for 912 million at an average price of 1220 per share 

in october 2001 we issued 400 million principal amount of the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of 389 million the notes were convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2600 per share which was equal to a conversion rate of approximately 384615 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes we made annual interest payments of 15 million paid semiannually on the notes commencing on april 15 2002 during 2004 and 2005 we repurchased 100 million of the outstanding notes pursuant to authorization from our board of directors the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the return we would earn on high grade investment securities on january 26 2006 management was given further authorization by our board to repurchase up to the full 300 million of the principal amount that remained outstanding under the notes through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon during 2006 repayments of longterm debt and notes payable used cash of 3046 million in the first and third quarter of 2006 we repurchased notes of 150 million and 240 million respectively and we repaid the remaining 261 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 

we operate in a highly cyclical industry and we may experience with relatively short notice significant fluctuations in demand for our products this could result in a material effect on our liquidity position we expect based upon our current estimate of our revenue and operating results for fiscal year 2009 that our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of 3743 million will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months if our estimates of revenue and operating results for fiscal year 2009 significantly decrease we could be required to obtain additional financing however if financing is necessary there can be no assurance that such capital will be available or that the terms will be acceptable to us inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

we adopted the funded status recognition provision of sfas 158 effective december 31 2006 this standard amends sfas 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by sfas 158 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 34 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the largest portion of our 2008 pension expense was 28 million for our supplemental executive defined benefit plan pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations two assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of pension plan expense and 

  

assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 775 was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal year 2008 we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust the rate as necessary the current asset allocation for our us qualified pension plan is 37 invested in equity securities and 63 invested in fixed income securities our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 

we base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2008 under the us qualified pension plan we had cumulative losses of approximately 625 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on citigroup pension index adjusted for the plan’s expected cash flows and was 62 at december 31 2008 down from 65 at december 31 2007 we estimate that in 2009 we will recognize approximately 11 million of pension expense for the us qualified pension plan the pension expense estimate for 2009 is based on a 62 discount rate and 775 return on plan assets future pension expense or benefit will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans as of december 31 2008 we had unrecognized pension losses of 1446 million of which 1273 million is for the us qualified pension plan 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense benefit that would have resulted for the year ended december 31 2008 if we changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 

 

 the assets of the us qualified pension plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities the value of our us qualified pension plan assets has decreased from 2540 million at december 31 2007 to 1845 million at december 31 2008 our funding policy is to make contributions to the pension plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2008 there were no additional contributions made to the us qualified pension plan and we made 43 million of additional contributions to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries based upon the us qualified pension plan funded status as of december 31 2008 we do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in 2009 contributions that will be made in 2009 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately 31 million 

  

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in “note o stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have the 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 the 2006 equity plan replaces our 1996 nonemployee director stock option plan our 1997 employee stock option plan and our 1991 employee stock option plan each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 equity plan we may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise vesting or expiration as applicable 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2008 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

        

the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers directors consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2008 was 6875000 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 24 2016 in 2008 and 2007 we only issued restricted stock unit awards to our employees and directors 

as of december 31 2008 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested awards and options totaled 403 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 265 years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies all of our auction rate marketable securities are aaa aa or a rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a us department of education agency or a third party insurer we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the european euro great britain pound japanese yen and the taiwan dollar these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures in addition we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in shortterm and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10 fluctuation in interest rates was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio on these bases the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is 06 million and 03 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively

on november 30 2005 we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of our interconnection systems products business that designs and manufactures backplane systems printed circuit boards and highspeed highdensity connectors “connection systems” including the capital stock of our whollyowned subsidiaries teradyne connection systems malaysia sdn bhd teradyne connection sys de mexico sa de cv and teradyne ireland ltd to amphenol corporation pursuant to an asset and stock purchase agreement dated as of october 10 2005 between teradyne and amphenol as amended 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” we are reporting connection systems and broadband test division as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented see “note e discontinued operations” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the connection systems and broadband test division divestitures unless indicated otherwise amounts provided throughout this form 10k relate to continuing operations only 

on march 7 2007 we purchased inprocess enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from mosaid technologies inc for 176 million which includes 06 million in fees directly related to the acquisition of the purchase price 167 million has been allocated to inprocess research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations the balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets 

this technology was purchased for the development of a new semiconductor test product as of the acquisition date the technology had not reached technical feasibility had no alternative future use and its fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability and therefore has been classified as inprocess research and development the technology is unique to the semiconductor test market and requires significant development the estimated fair value of the inprocess technology was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model using an income approach estimated cash flows were probability adjusted to take into account the stage 

  

of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the inprocess technology such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the inprocess project as well as the estimated cash flows to be generated as a result of completing the project development

products 

semiconductor test 

we design manufacture sell and support semiconductor test products and services on a world wide basis the test systems we provide are used both for wafer level and device package testing these chips are used in automotive communications consumer computer and electronic game applications among others semiconductor devices span a broad range of functionality from very simple lowcost devices such as appliance microcontrollers operational amplifiers or voltage regulators to complex digital signal processors and microprocessors semiconductor test products and services are sold to integrated device manufacturers “idms” that integrate the fabrication of silicon wafers into their business “fabless” companies that outsource the manufacturing of silicon wafers “foundries” that cater to the processing and manufacturing of silicon wafers and subcontractors “subcons” that provide test and assembly services for the final packaged devices to both fabless companies and idms fabless companies perform the design of integrated circuits without manufacturing capabilities and use foundries for wafer manufacturing and subcons for test and assembly these customers obtain the overall benefit of both comprehensively testing devices and reducing the total costs associated with testing by using our semiconductor test systems to 

 

  

  

  

 we have made significant investments in the last several years to introduce the new flex™ test platform architecture the flex test platform architecture advances our core technologies to produce test equipment 

  

that is designed for high efficiency multisite testing multisite testing involves the simultaneous testing of more devices and functions in parallel leading semiconductor manufacturers are using multisite testing to significantly improve their “cost of test” economics the flex test platform architecture addresses customer requirements through four key capabilities 

1 a high efficiency multisite architecture that eliminates tester overhead such as instrument setup synchronization and data movement and signal processing 

2 the igxl™ software operating system which provides fast program development including instant conversion from single to multisite test 

3 broad technology coverage by instruments designed to cover the range of test parameters coupled with a universal slot test head design that allows easy test system reconfiguration to address changing test needs and 

4 an open architecture design openflex ™ which complements the flex test platform’s broad set of highdensity instrumentation by allowing third parties and customers to create customized test instrumentation that can further enhance system performance and test economics 

flex test platform purchases are being made by idms subcons and fabless customers the flex test platform has become a widely used test solution at subcons and test houses by providing versatile testers that can handle the widest range of devices allowing subcons to leverage their capital investments the broad consumer automotive and broadband markets have been driving most of the device volume growth in the semiconductor industry these markets include cell phones set top boxes hdtvs game controllers computer graphics and automotive controllers to name a few these end use markets are continuing to be a strong growth driver for the flex test platform family of products because they require a wide range of technologies and instrument coverage the flex test platform has an installed base of more than 1500 customer systems to date 

our j750 ™ test system shares the igxl software environment with the family of flex test platform systems the j750 is designed to address the highest volume semiconductor devices such as microcontrollers that are central to the functionality of almost every consumer electronics product from small appliances to automotive engine controllers j750 test systems combine compact packaging high throughput and ease of production test these benefits are possible due to the high level of integration in the design a single circuit board in the j750 test system provides up to 64 digital inputoutput channels we extended the j750 platform technology to create the ip750 image sensor ™ test system the ip750 is focused on testing image sensor devices used in digital cameras and other imaging products the j750 platform has an installed base of over 2500 systems and it continues to grow 

we continued to invest in the j750 platform with a set of j750ex ™ instrumentation that was released in 2007 with additional instrument releases planned for 2008 these instruments are bringing new capabilities to existing market segments and expanding the j750 platform to critical new devices that include high end microcontroller lcd drivers and the latest generation of cameras these new j750ex instruments are designed to be compatible with our customer’s existing hardware and software investments and deliver industry leading parallel test economics while providing customers with flexibility to address next generation functional requirements 

systems test group 

our systems test group segment is comprised of 3 business units militaryaerospace “milaero” test commercial board test and diagnostic solutions 

milaero test 

our expertise in the test and diagnosis of printed circuit boards “pcb” and subsystems has proven to be essential in supporting the everdemanding military and aerospace markets our test solutions for these markets include highperformance systems instruments and software solutions that manufacturers and repair depots depend on to ensure the readiness of commercial and military electronic systems 

  

new programs from tactical aircraft to missile systems as well as widespread enhancement programs continue to fuel the demand for high performance test systems we are a leading provider of test instrumentation and systems with performance well suited to the demands of militaryaerospace electronics manufacturers and repair depots worldwide success in this market is illustrated by our penetration into major department of defense programs across all us military service branches and many allied military services worldwide 

commercial board test 

we also produce a variety of test and inspection systems sold to many of the industry’s leading pcb original equipment manufacturers “oems” and subcons around the world because today’s pcbs and electronic assemblies handle more functionality than ever before they contain highly integrated circuits and more complex components that operate faster use lower voltages and are more susceptible to assembly problems our assembly test and inspection systems combine the advanced diagnostic hardware and operating software needed to ensure product quality sustain high manufacturing yield verify functional operation diagnose faults and effectively reduce manufacturing costs our products are sold to the electronics manufacturers of cell phones servers computers internet switches automobiles and military avionics systems worldwide 

incircuit test systems 

we manufacture incircuit test “ict” systems that are used to assess electrical interconnections verify interoperation and find faulty circuits aboard fully assembled and soldered pcbs fast accurate and costeffective diagnostic capabilities are hallmark features of our ict systems including the teststation™ and spectrum™ product families used in a variety of inline highvolume pcb test applications these systems are also used in sample test environments for prototype testing and earlystage pcb design and development supporting technologies such as our patented safetest™ technology allow teststation users to safely troubleshoot the lowvoltage components and interconnects commonly found in batterypowered portable consumer electronics and lowpower commercial equipment in addition to standard ict equipment we offer combinational test platforms and handlerready inline test systems for highvolume board manufacturing 

imaging inspection systems 

pcb assembly trends are expected to force board manufacturers to reassess their inspection strategies due to the growing use of highly integrated system on chips and higher density doublesided boards a high percentage of all solder connections are invisible to optical inspection systems combine this growing loss of visual and electrical access with the difficulties associated with detecting leadfree solder voids on doublesided boards and the inspection problem is compounded our newly introduced xstation™ mx a fully automated xray inspection “axi” system addresses these problems when inspecting pcbs for manufacturing defects including improper component placement and orientation electrical opens and shorts and a host of other board quality issues the xstation mx uses clearvue™ a patented threedimensional xray imaging technique to more accurately detect subtle defects and manufacturing flaws even as board complexities grow 

diagnostic solutions 

we provide electronic test and diagnostic systems to the automotive oems and their major subcontractors the systems are used throughout the vehicle’s lifecycle from design through manufacture to after sale service and consist of highly integrated software and hardware components as the number and complexity of electronic systems and embedded software proliferate in vehicles the ability to manufacture and service those vehicles becomes increasingly dependent on electronic diagnostic equipment our diagnostic solutions’ products fall into two categories 

oem service diagnostics 

oem dealer service technicians use our systems to find faults in vehicles in use by their customers and to reduce oem warranty costs historically the focus has been on fixing faults in the service bay but is now growing to include the programming of vehicle software 

  

vehicle configuration and test solutions 

our vcats™ products are used on automotive and major automotive subassembly production lines these products connect to the vehicle to test and program or “configure” the electronic systems on vehicles these vehicle electronic systems include engine control modules and subsystems such as braking navigation and climate control our vcats products are also able to link to an oem’s manufacturing control system in order to provide statistical quality reports to operators and management 

both vcats and oem service diagnostics products utilize our gradex™ authoring software enabling the manufacturing and service phases of vehicle development diagnostics for electronic modules and systems used on vehicles of our customers can be developed and written using the gradex authoring software the actual diagnosis of a customer’s vehicle occurs in the oem dealer’s service bay utilizing a runtime portion of the software to facilitate the service and repair of the vehicle 

discontinued operations 

on august 1 2007 our broadband test division business was sold to tollgrade communications inc this business provided test systems for testing lines and qualifying lines for dsl telephone networks on november 30 2005 our connection systems business was sold to amphenol corporation this business designed and manufactured highperformance connection systems including backplane systems printed circuit boards and highspeed highdensity connectors connection systems and broadband test division have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 

summary of net revenue by reportable segment 

our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of last three years 

 

 during the third quarter of 2007 our internal management reporting changed to better align with our operational management structure resulting in a change in our reportable segments segment reporting has been restated for all periods presented to reflect this change see “note s operating segments and geographic information” in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

sales and distribution 

prices for our systems can reach 2 million or more in 2007 2006 and 2005 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenue in each of the years 2007 2006 and 2005 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 16 18 and 18 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

direct sales to united states government agencies accounted for 5 3 and 3 of consolidated net revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively approximately 23 14 and 15 of systems test group’s revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively was to united states government agencies and 16 13 and 17 of systems test group’s revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively was to government contractor customers 

we have sales and service offices located throughout north america asia and europe as our customers outside the united states are located primarily in these geographic areas we sell in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force our manufacturing activities are primarily conducted through subcontractors and outsourced contract manufacturers with a significant operation concentrated in china 

  

sales to customers outside the united states accounted for 77 77 and 78 of consolidated net revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively sales to customers located in singapore were 15 11 and 14 of consolidated net revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively sales to customers located in taiwan were 13 14 and 13 of consolidated net revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively sales to customers located in japan were 12 12 and 9 of consolidated net revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site

competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments these competitors include among others advantest corporation verigy inc credence systems corporation ltx corporation and eagle test systems inc some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 our backlog of unfilled orders in our two reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2007 approximately 97 of the semiconductor test backlog and 96 of systems test group backlog is expected to be delivered in 2008 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers certain of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delays or ceases to deliver products 

  

intellectual property and licenses 

the development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we employed approximately 3600 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances we have no collective bargaining contracts 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 were 2043 million 2024 million and 2164 million respectively these expenditures amounted to approximately 19 15 and 21 of consolidated net revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated the amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of investigation estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which 

  

may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics which historically has been highly cyclical 

our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems we manufacture and market we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we cannot assure that the level of revenues or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability 

the following factors are expected to impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

  

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on 

  

our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependant upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements many of our suppliers have implemented cost reduction strategies just as we have to address the slowdowns in the market it may be difficult for these suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform 

we depend on flextronics international ltd “flextronics” to manufacture and test our flex family of products from their facility in china if for any reason flextronics cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion or at all we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business 

we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers many of which are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time difficulties their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse affect on our operations which could result in a decline in our stock price 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and such other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by our failure to expand operations or earnings in certain countries the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

we may continue to acquire new businesses or form strategic alliances in the future and we may not always realize the benefits of such acquisitions 

in january 2008 we acquired nextest systems corporation we may continue to acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses if we acquire businesses or technologies we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate it with our existing operations and company culture we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize value from expected synergies we cannot assure that following an acquisition we will achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition additionally we may fund the acquisition of new businesses strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or by other means the financing of such transactions may affect our stock price or significantly dilute our shareholders 

  

we have taken measures to ensure that we are prepared to address slowdowns in the market for our products which could have longterm negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 

we have taken and continue to take measures to ensure that we are prepared to address slowdowns in the market for our products these measures include shifting more of our operations to lower cost regions outsourcing manufacturing processes divesting of certain businesses implementing material cost reduction programs and reducing planned capital expenditures and expense budgets we cannot assure that the measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete to operate effectively to operate profitably during slowdowns or to effectively meet a rapid increase in customer demand these measures may have longterm negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in our products making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and to quickly respond to customers or competitors in an upward cycle 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2007 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations and financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of 

  

an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

for example in connection with our august 2000 acquisition of each of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc a complaint was filed on or about september 5 2001 by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of our then executive officers additionally in 2001 we were designated as a “potentially responsible party” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim also arises out of our acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated october 20 1992 these matters are further described in “item 3 legal proceedings” 

we have significant guarantees and indemnification obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results for additional information see “note k commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products “ip” in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or require a significant use of management resources and necessitate a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect our operating results 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles which are difficult to predict 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies and resulting reductions in customer capital investments the duration of slowdowns in global economies and reductions in customer capital investments which may adversely impact our business are difficult to predict 

acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact our business 

acts of war and terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees facilities customers suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or 

  

financial condition as we our outsourced manufacturing providers and our suppliers sell and manufacture products both in the united states and internationally the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at these locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems we have completed some emergency preparedness planning and have a business continuity plan in case some of these events occur however we cannot be certain that our plans will be effective in the event of a disaster or other situation all of these conditions make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

during 2007 we made several important corporate governance changes which included declassification of our board of directors adoption of majority voting standard for the election of our directors and early termination of our shareholder rights plan despite these changes there are still provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

in 2001 we were designated as a potentially responsible party “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arose out of our acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement in 1992 neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site we have asked the state of california to drop the prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so 

we believe that we have meritorious defenses against the above unsettled claims and intend to vigorously contest them while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of the unsettled claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise we believe the potential losses associated with all of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to its consolidated results of operations of any one period 

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as but not limited to patent employment commercial and environmental matters although there can be no assurance there are no such matters pending that we expect to be material with respect to its business financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the historical information contained in this document the discussion in this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements made pursuant to section 21e of the exchange act that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans expectations and intentions the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as being applicable to all related forwardlooking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forwardlooking statements factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in “item 1a risk factors” and elsewhere herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes pensions warranties 

  

contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 

our equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 

for multiple element arrangements we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customer’s ability to use the product we defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” technical bulletin 901 

our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop no 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” “sop 972” we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for such elements in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

  

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

inventories 

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses our inventory balance at december 31 2007 was 803 million net of writedowns to net realizable value of 1056 million 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provision of sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods under this transition method stock based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 includes compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stock based compensation” “sfas 123” stockbased compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted after january 1 2006 is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of sfas 123r as required by sfas 123r we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of sfas 123r was not material 

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r we recognized stockbased compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “apb 25” in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” regarding the sec’s interpretation of sfas 123r and the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies we have applied provisions of sab 107 in our adoption of sfas 123r see “note b accounting policies” and “note o stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stockbased compensation 

on may 26 2005 our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding unvested “out of the money” stock options awarded to employees officers and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of 1326 the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may 26 2005 and ranged in exercise price from 1373 to 4137 per share as a result of the vesting acceleration options to purchase approximately 76 million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under sfas 123r by approximately 486 million in the aggregate on a pretax basis over fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance as a result of its review undertaken at december 31 2002 we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized 

  

and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions most notably the united states due to the continued uncertainty of realization we maintained our valuation allowance at december 31 2007 and 2006 this valuation allowance may reverse at some time in the future if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized we continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis any reversal of the valuation allowance will result in an increase in our net income but not to the full extent of the reversal in the quarter in which reversal of the tax asset valuation allowance is made 

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess

results of operations 

discontinued operations 

on august 1 2007 we completed the sale of the broadband test division to tollgrade for 113 million in cash broadband test division had revenues for the seven month period ended july 31 2007 of 112 million for the year ended december 31 2006 of 206 million and for the year ending december 31 2005 of 301 million loss from discontinued operations of our broadband test division for the year ended december 31 2007 was 63 million loss for the year ended december 31 2006 was 55 million and income for the year ended december 31 2005 was 32 million in 2007 we recorded a gain on the sale of broadband test division of 59 million net of a tax provision of 04 million 

on november 30 2005 we completed the sale of our connection systems to amphenol corporation for an adjusted purchase price of 3847 million connection systems had revenues for the eleven month period ended november 30 2005 of 3310 million loss from discontinued operations of connection systems for the year ended december 31 2006 was 39 million relating to a change in estimate to tax expenses from the sale under applicable accounting guidance there is an offsetting tax benefit recorded in continuing operations for the same amount this tax provision results from the finalization of the 2005 us tax return income from connection systems through the date of sale in 2005 was 1511 million including a gain on sale of connection systems of 1370 million net of a tax provision of 310 million 

in accordance with sfas 144 we are reporting broadband test division and connection systems as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this annual report on form 10k unless indicated otherwise the discussion and amounts provided in this “results of operations” section and elsewhere in this form 10k relate to continuing operations only 

bookings 

our net orders for our two reportable segments for 2007 2006 and 2005 are as follows 

 

 the semiconductor test business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for test equipment which historically has been highly cyclical the semiconductor test bookings decrease of 1129 million or 11 from 2006 to 2007 was driven by less demand across a wide range of end markets applications and geographies as soc device units grew at a lower rate in 2007 than in 2006 this decrease was lessened by our semiconductor test increase in soc market share during 2007 by approximately 2 to 3 points the increase of 1322 million or 15 in semiconductor test bookings from 2005 to 2006 was attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets as customers invested in soc test equipment principally in the first half of 2006 during 2006 the flex family of testers moved into mainstream production and along with the j750 platform contributed to almost all of the growth experienced we also saw a customer shift in orders from 2005 to 2006 with subcontractors making up a larger percentage of orders 

the systems test group’s decrease of 623 million or 23 in orders from 2006 to 2007 was due to decreases in each business unit diagnostic solutions orders are program related and have significant fluctuations bookings were down due to a large program rollout in 2006 for the vehicle measurement module product line milaero test bookings are also often program related and bookings decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a significant military program concluded during 2007 commercial board test bookings decreased in 

  

2007 due to a contraction in the size of the ict market the systems test group’s increase of 98 million or 4 in orders from 2005 to 2006 was primarily driven by demand in the milaero test business due to the cyclical nature of the milaero test program buys offset slightly by a decrease in diagnostic solutions 

our order cancellations and backlog adjustments for our two reportable segments for the last three years are as follows 

 

 customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties in 2007 and 2006 there were no significant cancellation penalties received due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows 

 

 for the past three years our backlog of unfilled orders for our two reportable segments is as follows 

 

 revenue 

our net revenue for our two reportable segments for 2007 2006 and 2005 is as follows 

 

   

semiconductor test decrease in revenue of 2124 million or 20 from 2006 to 2007 is due to soc device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006 this decrease was lessened by our semiconductor test increase in soc market share during 2007 by approximately 2 to 3 points this resulted in decreased demand across a wide range of end markets applications and geographies semiconductor test revenue increase of 2747 million or 34 from 2005 to 2006 can be attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets as customers invested in soc test equipment almost the entire increase in 2006 is related to our flex family and j750 products and is distributed across all regions the increase is partially offset by a decrease of certain nonflex test systems 

systems test group revenue decrease of 415 million or 16 from 2006 to 2007 can be attributed to a decrease in diagnostic solutions sales due to a large program rollout in 2006 for the vehicle measurement module product line the systems test group increase of 364 million or 16 in revenue from 2005 to 2006 was driven by a strong increase in diagnostic solutions sales due primarily to the vehicle measurement module product line 

our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years 

 

 our net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows 

 

 our product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows 

 

 although product revenue decreased 2572 million or 23 in 2007 from 2006 due to soc device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006 service revenue which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products remained relatively flat from 2006 service revenue includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support 

in the past three years no single customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 16 18 and 18 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

  

gross margin 

 

 the decrease in gross margin of 15 points from 2006 to 2007 was the result of several factors a reduction in semiconductor test sales volume contributed to a decrease of 15 points a shift in product mix primarily related to higher service revenue as a percentage of total revenue contributed to a decrease of 2 points these decreases were offset by an increase of 1 point due to lower semiconductor test inventory provisions in 2007 and an increase of 1 point resulting from lower fixed costs and employee compensation across both segments 

the increase in gross margin of approximately 10 points from 2005 to 2006 was the result of several factors an increase in semiconductor test sales volume contributed 4 points a shift in product mix within semiconductor test contributed 2 points an improvement in service margins primarily within semiconductor test contributed 2 points the remaining 2 point increase was due to lower inventory provisions in 2006 as we recorded a 385 million charge for nonflex products in the semiconductor test segment in 2005 compared to an 80 million charge for nonflex products in 2006 

the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value these writeoffs and writedowns consist of raw materials and components sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision which is recorded in cost of revenues during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we sold inventory previously reserved of 12 million 28 million and 15 million respectively 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded inventory provisions of 18 million in cost of revenues of which 03 million was for excess inventory and 15 million was for obsolete inventory of the 18 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 05 million related to semiconductor test and 13 million related to systems test group 

  

during the year ended december 31 2006 we recorded inventory provisions of 128 million in cost of revenues of which 117 million was for excess inventory and 11 million was for obsolete inventory of the 128 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 115 million related to semiconductor test including an 80 million provision for the writedown of excess nonflex inventory and 13 million related to systems test group 

during the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded inventory provisions of 490 million in cost of revenues of which 369 million was for excess inventory and 121 million was for obsolete inventory of the 490 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 455 million related to semiconductor test including a 385 million provision for the writedown of excess nonflex inventory and 35 million related to systems test group 

we scrapped 335 million 295 million and 341 million of inventory which had been previously writtendown or writtenoff during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we have no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory that has been previously writtendown to net realizable value as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had inventory reserves for amounts which have been writtendown to net realizable value of 1056 million and 1384 million respectively of the reserves at december 31 2007 18 million 113 million 469 million and 456 million relate to inventory provisions recorded in 2007 2006 2005 and prior to 2005 respectively 

engineering and development 

 

 the increase of 19 million in engineering and development expenses from 2006 to 2007 was due in part to a 103 million increase in spending related to new products and entry into adjacent markets primarily in the semiconductor test segment this was partially offset by lower variable employee compensation of 84 million 

during 2006 and 2005 we reduced our levels of investment in engineering and development spending more than 80 of our total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test segment where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between 150 and 250 million during 2005 semiconductor test completed its ultraflex platform development and shifted its focus to increasing the instrumentation set on its flex test platform ultraflex and flex which requires lower levels of engineering and development expenditures 

the decrease of 140 million in engineering and development spending from 2005 to 2006 consists of the following amounts 

 

  

 these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

   

selling and administrative 

 

 the decrease in selling and administrative spending of 322 million from 2006 to 2007 consists of the following 

 

  

 the increase in selling and administrative spending of 370 million from 2005 to 2006 consists of the following 

 

  

  

 these increases from 2005 to 2006 were partially offset by the following 

 

  

 inprocess research and development 

on march 7 2007 we purchased inprocess enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from mosaid technologies inc for 176 million which includes 06 million in fees directly related to the acquisition of the purchase price 167 million has been allocated to inprocess research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations the balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets 

this technology was purchased to be used in the development of a new semiconductor test product as of the acquisition date the technology had not reached technical feasibility had no alternative future use and its fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability and therefore has been classified as inprocess research and development the technology is unique to the semiconductor test market and requires significant development the estimated fair value of the inprocess technology was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model using an income approach estimated cash flows were probability adjusted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the inprocess technology such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the inprocess project as well as the estimated cash flows to be generated as a result of completing the project development 

restructuring and other net 

in response to a downturn in the industry we initiated restructuring activities in 2002 across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations further 

  

actions were initiated in 2003 to a lesser extent in 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 additionally in 2005 2006 and 2007 as part of our facility consolidation we sold certain real estate the tables below represent activity related to these actions the remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the longterm other accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2012 we expect to pay out approximately 22 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months our future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of 78 million as of december 31 2007 we have subleased approximately 55 of our unoccupied space as of december 31 2007 and are actively attempting to sublease the remaining space 

2007 activities 

 

 we recorded the following activity related to the 2007 restructuring activities 

 

  

  

 the restructuring actions taken during the year ended december 31 2007 are expected to generate quarterly cost savings of approximately 35 million across all segments 

2006 activities 

 

 we recorded the following activity related to the 2006 restructuring activities 

 

  

   

 2005 activities 

 

 we recorded the following activity related to the 2005 restructuring activities 

 

  

  

  

  

 pre2005 activities 

 

   

for pre2005 restructuring activities we recorded the following activity in 2007 

 

  

 during february 2008 we implemented reductioninforce activities across all reportable segments functions and geographies this will include a reduction of approximately 175 employees and a severance charge during the first quarter of 2008 of approximately 95 million these actions are expected to result in annual savings of approximately 25 million 

interest income and expense 

 

 the decrease in interest income from 2006 to 2007 was primarily attributable to lower cash balances due to the stock repurchase activity in 2007 the increase in interest income from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributable to higher cash balances primarily from the proceeds received from the divestiture of connection systems 

the decrease in interest expense from 2006 to 2007 was due primarily to the repayment of our 375 senior convertible notes the “notes” in 2006 the decrease in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 was due primarily to the repayment of notes in the fourth quarter of 2006 and repurchases made earlier in the year 

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

 the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2006 to 2007 was mainly due to the 20 reduction in revenue in the semiconductor test segment which was a result of soc device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in corporate from 2006 to 2007 is primarily related to the elimination of our interest expense due to the repayment of our notes in 2006 and gains from sales of real estate which totaled 36 million the change to an income position from 2005 to 2006 was mainly attributable to increased sales in semiconductor test and to a lesser extent gains on the sale of real estate primarily in semiconductor test and additional interest income net included in corporate of 320 million 

income taxes 

during 2007 the income tax expense from continuing operations totaled 74 million the expense relates primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes offset by benefits related to the utilization of foreign tax credits in the us during 2006 the income tax expense from continuing operations totaled 279 million the expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes offset by benefits from a 60 million credit related to us pension funding and the settlement of a california income tax audit for 1998 through 2000 for the year ended december 31 2005 there was a tax benefit from continuing operations that totaled 197 million under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” a benefit for 292 million was recognized for losses 

  

relating to 2005 continuing operations as a result of the sale of connection systems there was an equal and offsetting tax provision in the gain on sale of connection system in discontinued operations the remaining portion of the net tax benefit includes a tax provision that related primarily to foreign taxes 

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 

 

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased 2017 million in 2007 from 2006 to 7429 million cash activity for 2007 2006 and 2005 was as follows in millions 

 

 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired used cash of 442 million in 2007 this was due to a number of factors including an increase in accounts receivable of 337 million due to an increase in days sales outstanding from 55 days in 2006 to 66 days in 2007 a reduction of accrued income taxes of 309 million due to the payments of 2006 foreign income taxes around the world and an increase in other assets of 250 million primarily related to balances due for inventory provided to our outsourced subcontract manufacturer of 157 million these uses of cash were offset by a decrease in our inventory balances due to shorter cycle times with our flex products changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired provided cash of 1691 million in 2006 

  

primarily due to a decrease of accounts receivable balances of 679 million resulting mostly from the decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 additionally there was a decrease in inventory of 793 million due to shorter cycle times with our flex products and an increase of 328 million in accrued income taxes due to higher foreign income taxes in 2006 compared to 2005 these providers of cash were partially offset by retirement plan contributions of 302 million of which 200 million was a contribution to our us qualified pension plan changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired used cash of 492 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of 587 million and retirement plan contributions of 401 million partially offset by a 699 million decrease in inventory 

investing activities consist of purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities proceeds from the sale of businesses proceeds from asset disposals proceeds from the sale of product lines cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets capital expenditures were 861 million in 2007 1100 million in 2006 and 1127 million in 2005 capital expenditures decreased by 239 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a decrease of internally manufactured systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in semiconductor test of approximately 181 million the remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across teradyne proceeds from asset disposals were 88 million and 850 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively and primarily consist of sales of real estate in march 2007 we bought an enabling technology from mosaid technologies inc for a purchase price and related costs totaling 176 million investing activities of discontinued operations provided 108 million of cash in 2007 included in this balance is the net proceeds we received related to the sale of our broadband test division to tollgrade in august 2007 investing activities of discontinued operations provided 3664 million of cash in 2005 and includes the net proceeds related to our sale of connection systems to amphenol corporation in november 2005 

financing activities include issuance of our common stock repurchases of teradyne’s common stock as well as repayments of debt during 2006 and 2005 repayments of longterm debt used cash of 3046 million and 987 million respectively upon maturity in the fourth quarter of 2006 we paid off the outstanding balance of our outstanding notes which approximated 261 million aggregate principal we also repurchased portions of our outstanding notes in the first and third quarters of 2006 in the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and the third quarter of 2004 during 2007 2006 and 2005 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated 232 million 233 million and 347 million respectively in july 2006 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program which was completed in october 2007 in total 400 million of common stock was repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions during 2006 we repurchased 106 million shares of common stock for 1378 million for an average price per share of 1298 during 2007 we repurchased 173 million shares of common stock for 2622 million for an average price per share of 1513 in november 2007 our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase program allowing us to spend an aggregate of 400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock as of december 31 2007 we repurchased 10 million shares of our common stock under this program for an average price per share of 1166 

in october 2001 we issued 400 million principal amount of the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of 389 million the notes were convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2600 per share which was equal to a conversion rate of approximately 384615 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes we made annual interest payments of 15 million paid semiannually on the notes commencing on april 15 2002 in august 2004 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 10150 of the principal amount the board subsequently amended its authorization on october 21 2005 to authorize repurchases through open market purchases privately negotiated transaction auctions by redemption pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture or other means as determined by our ceo or cfo at prices below 10075 of the principal amount the 100 million authorization for repurchase was fully utilized by management during the third quarter of 2004 and the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to repurchase 85 million 200 million and 715 million of the notes respectively the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below 

  

the return we would earn on high grade investment securities on january 26 2006 management was given further authorization by our board to repurchase up to the full 300 million of the principal amount that remained outstanding under the notes through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon during 2006 we repurchased notes of 150 million in the first quarter 240 million in the third quarter and we repaid the remaining 261 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 

unrealized losses related to our marketable securities totaled 12 million at december 31 2007 approximately 337 million of our total investment portfolio of marketable securities were invested in debt securities that have an unrealized loss that has existed for greater than one year as of december 31 2007 of the securities 15 million mature within the first quarter of 2008 we review our investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in market value based on our review we have determined that the unrealized losses are temporary 

on january 24 2008 we completed the acquisition of nextest for an estimated purchase price of 325 million this estimated purchase price is net of the cash acquired and includes the fair value of fully vested employee equity instruments and transaction costs 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at december 31 2007 of 7429 million will be sufficient to fund the acquisition of nextest as well as meet the working capital and expenditure needs for at least the foreseeable future inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

we adopted the funded status recognition provision of sfas 158 effective december 31 2006 this standard amends sfas 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by sfas 158 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 72 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the largest portion of our 2007 pension expense was 31 million for our supplemental executive defined benefit plan pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations two assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of pension plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 

in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 775 was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2007 we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust the rate as necessary the current asset allocation for our us qualified pension plan is 463 invested in equity securities and 537 invested in fixed income securities which is in accordance with the plan’s asset allocation requirements our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2007 was virtually identical to the plan’s asset allocation model our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 

  

we base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2007 under the us qualified pension plan we had cumulative gains of approximately 32 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index which was 65 at december 31 2007 up from 59 at december 31 2006 as a result we selected 65 for our december 31 2007 discount rate up from 60 as of december 31 2006 the duration of the citigroup pension liability index at december 31 2007 was 151 years which approximates the duration of the portfolio of pension liabilities we estimate that in 2008 we will recognize approximately 22 million of pension benefit for the us qualified pension plan the pension benefit estimate for 2008 is based on a 65 discount rate and 775 return on plan assets future pension expense or benefit will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans as of december 31 2007 we had unrecognized pension losses of 471 million of which 342 million is for the us qualified pension plan 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense benefit that would have resulted for the year ended december 31 2007 if we changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 

 

 the assets of the us qualified pension plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities the value of our us qualified pension plan assets has increased from 2490 million at december 31 2006 to 2540 million at december 31 2007 our funding policy is to make contributions to the pension plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2007 there were no additional contributions made to the us qualified pension plan and we made 26 million of additional contributions to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries based upon the us qualified pension plan funded status as of december 31 2007 we do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in 2008 contributions that will be made in 2008 to certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately 24 million 

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in “note o stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have the 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 the 2006 equity plan replaces our 1996 nonemployee director stock option plan our 1997 employee stock option plan and our 1991 employee stock option plan each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 equity plan we may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise vesting or expiration 

  

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2007 share numbers in thousands 

 

  

    the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers directors consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31 2007 was 9980000 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 24 2016 in 2007 and 2006 we only issued restricted stock unit awards to our employees and directors 

as of december 31 2007 total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested awards and options totaled 249 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 291 years 

performance graph 

the following graph compares the change in our cumulative total shareholder return in our common stock with the standard  poor’s 500 index and the sp information technology 500 index the comparison assumes 10000 was invested on december 31 2002 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and assumes reinvestment of dividends if any 

  

 

  

  

 related party transaction 

during 2007 paul tufano a member of our board of directors was executive vice president chief financial officer and interim chief executive officer of solectron corporation until it was acquired by flextronics in october 2007 mr tufano is no longer an employee of solectron or flextronics in the ordinary course of business we have for the last ten years purchased printed circuit board assemblies from solectron and have also sold incircuit testers to solectron which we refer to as flextronics in august 2007 prior to the flextronics acquisition we expanded our contract with solectron to have it provide additional manufacturing and test services including areas of final configuration and test for most of our flex family of products in the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we purchased 2078 million 2299 million and 1531 million of printed circuit board assemblies and services from flextronics respectively sales of incircuit testers to flextronics for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 were 40 million 57 million and 57 million respectively as of december 31 2007 and 2006 198 million and 70 million respectively was included in accounts payable and 175 million and 13 million respectively was included in accounts receivable representing amounts due tofrom flextronics we believe that these purchases and sales were made on terms and conditions that were fair and not less favorable than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements this accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” this statement replaces fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r establishes new principles and requirements for how an acquiring company 1 recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 2 recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3 determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective for business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year beginning on or after december 15 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments forward currency contracts and accounts receivable we maintain cash and marketable securities investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities rated a or higher which have minimal credit risk the overall weighted average portfolio quality will be maintained at a minimum of aa or better at all times we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the european euro great britain pound japanese yen and the taiwan dollar these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures in addition we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates investments with interest rate risk include short and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10 fluctuation in interest rates was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio on these bases the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is 03 million and 26 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets doubtful accounts income taxes pensions warranties and loss contingencies management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to teradyne’s customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur 

teradyne’s equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received

for multiple element arrangements teradyne defers the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of teradyne teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately teradyne’s postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customer’s ability to use the product teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and teradyne defers revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” technical bulletin 901 

teradyne’s products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

teradyne generally does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products

inventories 

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value teradyne records a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses teradyne’s inventory balance at december 31 2007 was 803 million net of writedowns to net realizable value of 1056 million 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements and major renewals are capitalized and included in property plant and equipment accounts while expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense when assets are retired the assets and related allowances for depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 

teradyne provides for depreciation of its assets principally on the straight line method with the cost of the assets being charged to expense over their useful lives as follows 

 

 test systems manufactured internally are used by teradyne for customer evaluations and manufacturing and support of its customers teradyne depreciates the test systems manufactured internally over a sixyear life to cost of revenues and selling and administrative expenses teradyne often sells internally manufactured test equipment to customers upon the sale of an internally manufactured test system the net book value of the system is transferred to inventory and expensed as cost of revenues the net book value of internally manufactured test systems sold in the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was 330 million 400 million and 476 million respectively

teradyne inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

   

in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” teradyne reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset if impairment is indicated the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment if any contain management’s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time 

engineering and development costs 

teradyne’s products are highly technical in nature and require a large and continuing engineering and development effort software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to expense software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized until the product is available for release to customers to date the period between achieving technological feasibility and general availability of the product has been short and software development costs eligible for capitalization have not been material engineering and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of salaries contractor fees building costs depreciation and tooling costs

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when 

  

teradyne inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

   

the differences are expected to reverse the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if based upon weighted available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized us income taxes are not provided for on the earnings of nonus subsidiaries which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the us for intraperiod tax allocations teradyne has elected the tax law ordering approach which utilizes net operating loss carryforwards both income and equity prior to tax credit carryforwards 

translation of nonus currencies 

the functional currency for all nonus subsidiaries is the us dollar except for the systems test group business unit diagnostic solutions for which the local currency is its functional currency all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a quarterly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period all foreign currency denominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in operations and were immaterial for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 for diagnostic solutions assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period revenue and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

net income loss per common share 

basic net income loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period except where the result would be antidilutive to income before continuing operations diluted net income loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income loss by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares plus common stock equivalents if applicable 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the volatility of the industries that teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows which can impact their ability to make required payments teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customer’s recent payment history the customer’s current financial statements and other information regarding the customer’s credit worthiness account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is determined the receivable will not be recovered 

comprehensive income loss 

comprehensive income loss includes net income loss unrealized pension gains and losses unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt equity and derivative securities and cumulative translation adjustments 

 

 in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 establishes a

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

   

framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements this accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 teradyne is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” this statement replaces fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r establishes new principles and requirements for how an acquiring company 1 recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 2 recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3 determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective for business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year beginning on or after december 15 2008 teradyne is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard

 on march 7 2007 teradyne purchased inprocess enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from mosaid technologies inc for 176 million which includes 06 million in fees directly related to the acquisition of the purchase price 167 million has been allocated to inprocess research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations the balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets 

this technology was purchased to be used in the development of a new semiconductor test product as of the acquisition date the technology had not reached technical feasibility had no alternative future use and its fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability and therefore has been classified as inprocess research and development the technology is unique to the semiconductor test market and requires significant development the estimated fair value of the inprocess technology was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model using an income approach estimated cash flows were probability adjusted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the inprocess technology such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the inprocess project as well as the estimated cash flows to be generated as a result of completing the project development

derivatives 

teradyne conducts business in a number of foreign countries with certain transactions denominated in local currencies the purpose of teradyne’s foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign denominated net monetary assets and anticipated cash flows the terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged teradyne does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies teradyne enters into foreign currency forward contracts the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded directly in earnings and is used to offset the change in fair value of the net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies 

to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the future cash flows of revenue contracts denominated in a foreign currency teradyne enters into foreign currency forward contracts these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on teradyne’s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged transaction occurs these forward contracts generally expire within 24 months

the effective portion of derivative gains and losses related to cash flow hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs during fiscal 2007 teradyne did not enter into any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2006 01 million of losses were reclassified to revenue no cash flow hedges were derecognized or discontinued during fiscal 2007 and 2006 during 2006 and 2005 there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedges due to ineffectiveness 

concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of marketable securities forward currency contracts and accounts receivable teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities rated aa or higher which have minimal credit risk teradyne places forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable

 legal claims 

on september 5 2001 after teradyne’s august 2000 acquisition of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc the former owners of those companies filed a complaint against teradyne and two of our then executive officers in the federal district court in san diego california asserting securities fraud and breach of contract related to the acquisition the district court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs’ claims granted partial summary judgment against them with respect to their breach of contract claim and denied their motion for reconsideration in july 2007 after an appeal by the plaintiffs the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court rulings teradyne petitioned the ninth circuit for rehearing of the ruling that it reversed in october 2007 the ninth circuit denied teradyne’s petition for rehearing teradyne will continue to defend the claim that was sent back to the district court 

in 2001 teradyne was designated as a potentially responsible party “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arose out of teradyne’s acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement in 1992 neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site teradyne asked the state of california to drop the prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so 

teradyne believes that is has meritorious defenses against the above unsettled claims and intends to vigorously contest them while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of the unsettled claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise teradyne believes the potential losses associated with all of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to its consolidated results of operations of any one period 

in addition teradyne is subject to legal proceedings claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as but not limited to patent employment commercial and environmental matters although there can be no assurance there are no such matters pending that teradyne expects to be material with respect to its business financial position or results of operations

as a matter of ordinary business course teradyne warrants that its products including software products will substantially perform in accordance with its standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery most warranties have a one year duration commencing from installation a provision is recorded upon revenue recognition to cost of revenue for estimated warranty expense upon historical experience when teradyne receives revenue for extended warranties beyond the standard duration it is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period related costs are expensed as incurred as of december 31 2007 and 2006 teradyne had a product warranty accrual of 93 million and 129 million respectively in other accrued liabilities and revenue deferrals related to extended warranties of 66 million and 84 million respectively in deferred revenue 

in addition and in the ordinary course of business teradyne provides minimum purchase guarantees to certain of its vendors to ensure continuity of supply against the market demand although some of these guarantees provide penalties for cancellations andor modifications to the purchase commitments as the market demand decreases most of the guarantees do not therefore as the market demand decreases teradyne reevaluates these guarantees and determines what charges if any should be recorded

based on historical experience and information known as of december 31 2007 except for product warranty teradyne has not recorded any liabilities for these guarantees and obligations as of december 31 2007 because the amount would be immaterial 

 

 the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income loss per common share from continuing and discontinued operations 

 

 the computation of diluted net income per common share for the year ended december 31 2007 and 2006 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of options to purchase approximately 138 million and 153 million shares respectively because the exercise price of the option was greater than the average market price of the common shares as the effect would have been antdilutive the effect of teradyne’s outstanding convertible notes on diluted net income per share for the year ended december 31 2006 was calculated using the “if

converted” method as required by sfas no 128 “earnings per share” in using the “if converted” method 83 million of interest expense related to the convertible notes for the year ended december 31 2006 net of tax and profit sharing expenses was added back to net income to arrive at diluted net income accordingly 85 million incremental shares from the assumed conversion of the convertible debt are added to shares when calculating diluted net income per common share for the year ended december 31 2006 

the computation of diluted net loss per common share for the year ended december 31 2005 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of all options because the effect would have been antidilutive diluted loss income per common share for the year ended december 31 2005 also excludes 115 million shares related to teradyne’s convertible notes outstanding because the effect would have been antidilutive 

 

 in response to a downturn in the industry teradyne initiated restructuring activities in 2002 across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations further actions were initiated in 2003 to a lesser extent in 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 additionally in 2005 2006 and 2007 as part of teradyne’s facility consolidation teradyne began selling certain real estate the tables below represent activity related to these actions the remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the other longterm accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2012 teradyne expects to pay out approximately 22 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months with the remaining balance to be paid through 2012 our future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of 78 million as of december 31 2007

 in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review teradyne believes that 775 was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2007 for the us qualified pension plan

teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2007 under the us qualified pension plan teradyne had cumulative gains of approximately 32 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index which was at 65 at december 31 2007 up from 59 at december 31 2006 as a result teradyne selected 65 for its december 31 2007 discount rate up from 60 as of december 31 2006 

plan assets 

teradyne’s weighted average asset allocation at december 31 2007 and 2006 by asset category is as follows 

 

 teradyne employs a total return investment approach for its pension plan assets whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to ensure the preservation of capital and to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments the investment portfolio will not at any time have a direct investment in teradyne stock it may have an indirect investment in teradyne stock if one of the funds selected by the investment manager invests in teradyne stock 

the target asset allocation and index for each asset category for the us qualified pension plan per policy for the portfolio is as follows 

 

 teradyne’s investment manager regularly reviews teradyne’s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances teradyne’s portfolio to ensure alignment to the targeted allocation the investment return objectives are to achieve a rate of return which exceeds the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index by 3 per year and to avoid excessive volatility and produce a rate of return that at least matches the policy index identified above the manager’s investment performance is reviewed at least annually results for the total

semiconductor test systems 

we design manufacture sell and support semiconductor test systems on a world wide basis the test systems we provide are used both for wafer level and device package testing these chips are used in automotive communications consumer computer and electronic game applications among others semiconductor devices span a broad range of functionality from very simple lowcost devices such as appliance microcontrollers operational amplifiers or voltage regulators to complex digital signal processors and microprocessors semiconductor test systems are sold to integrated device manufacturers “idms” that integrate the fabrication of silicon wafers into their business “fabless” companies that outsource the manufacturing of silicon wafers “foundries” that cater to the processing and manufacturing of silicon wafers and subcontractors “subcons” that provide test and assembly services for the final packaged devices to both fabless companies and idms fabless companies perform the design of integrated circuits without manufacturing capabilities and use foundries for wafer manufacturing and subcons for test and assembly these customers obtain the overall benefit of comprehensively testing advanced performance devices while reducing their total costs associated with testing by using our semiconductor test systems to 

 

  

  

  

 we have made significant investments in the last several years to introduce the new flex™ test platform architecture the flex ™ test platform architecture advances our core technologies to produce test equipment that is designed for high efficiency multisite testing multisite testing involves the simultaneous testing of more devices and functions in parallel leading semiconductor manufacturers are using multisite testing to significantly improve their “cost of test” cot economics the flex test platform architecture addresses customer requirements through four key capabilities 

1 a high efficiency multisite architecture that eliminates tester overhead such as instrument setup synchronization and data movement and signal processing 

2 the igxl™ software operating system which provides fast program development including instant conversion from single to multisite test 

3 broad technology coverage by instruments designed to cover the range of test parameters coupled with a universal slot test head design that allows easy test system reconfiguration to address changing test needs and 

4 an open architecture design openflex which complements the flex test platform’s broad set of highdensity instrumentation by allowing third parties and customers to create customized test instrumentation that can further enhance system performance and test economics 

flex test platform purchases are being made by idms subcons and fabless customers the flex test platform has become a widely used test solution at subcons and test houses by providing versatile testers that can handle the widest range of devices allowing subcons to leverage their capital investments the broad consumer 

  

automotive and broadband markets have been driving most of the device volume growth in the semiconductor industry these markets include cell phones set top boxes hdtvs game controllers computer graphics and automotive controllers to name a few these end use markets are continuing to be a strong growth driver for the flex test platform family of products because they require a wide range of technologies and instrument coverage the flex test platform has an installed base of more than 1000 customer systems to date 

assembly test systems 

we also produce a variety of test and inspection systems sold to many of the industry’s leading printed circuit board “pcb” original equipment manufacturers “oems” and subcons around the world the demand for these products is being driven by rapid technological advances and the constant need to improve assembly quality because today’s pcbs and electronic assemblies bundle more functionality than ever before they contain highly integrated circuits and more complex components that operate faster use lower voltages and are more susceptible to assembly problems our assembly test and inspection systems combine the advanced diagnostic hardware and operating software needed to ensure product quality sustain high manufacturing yield verify functional operation diagnose faults and effectively reduce manufacturing costs our products are sold to the electronics manufacturers of cell phones servers computers internet switches automobiles and military avionics systems worldwide 

incircuit test systems 

we manufacture incircuit test “ict” systems that are used to assess electrical interconnections verify interoperation and find faulty circuits aboard fully assembled and soldered pcbs fast accurate and costeffective diagnostic capabilities are hallmark features of our ict systems including the teststation ™ and spectrum ™ product families used in a variety of inline highvolume pcb test applications these systems are also used in sample test environments for prototype testing and earlystage pcb design and development supporting technologies such as our patented safetest ™ technology allow teststation users to safely troubleshoot the lowvoltage components and interconnects commonly found in batterypowered portable consumer electronics and lowpower commercial equipment in addition to standard ict equipment we offer combinational test platforms and handlerready inline test systems for highvolume board manufacturing 

imaging inspection systems 

pcb assembly trends are expected to force board manufacturers to reassess their inspection strategies due to the growing use of highly integrated system on chips and higher density doublesided boards a high percentage of all solder connections are invisible to optical inspection systems combine this growing loss of visual and electrical access with the difficulties associated with detecting leadfree solder voids on doublesided boards and the inspection problem is compounded 

our newly introduced xstation ™ mx a fully automated xray inspection “axi” system addresses these problems when inspecting pcbs for manufacturing defects including improper component placement and orientation electrical opens and shorts and a host of other board quality issues the xstation mx uses clearvue ™  a patented threedimensional xray imaging technique to more accurately detect subtle defects and manufacturing flaws even as board complexities grow

diagnostic solutions 

diagnostic solutions provides electronic test and diagnostic systems to the automotive oems and their major subcontractors the systems are used throughout the vehicle’s lifecycle from design through manufacture to after sale service and consist of highly integrated software and hardware components as the number and complexity of electronic systems and embedded software proliferate in vehicles the ability to manufacture and service those vehicles becomes increasingly dependent on electronic diagnostic equipment diagnostic solutions’ products fall into two categories 

oem service diagnostics 

oem dealer service technicians use diagnostic solutions systems to find faults in vehicles in use by their customers and to reduce oem warranty costs historically the focus has been on fixing faults in the service bay but is now growing to include constant monitoring of the vehicle to predict and prevent failure 

vehicle configuration and test solutions 

diagnostic solutions’ vcats ™ products are used on automotive and major automotive subassembly production lines diagnostic solutions’ vcats connects to the vehicle to test and program or “configure” the electronic systems on vehicles these vehicle electronic systems include engine control modules and subsystems such as braking navigation and climate control diagnostic solutions is also able to link to an oem’s manufacturing control system in order to provide statistical quality reports to operators and management 

both vcats and oem service diagnostics products utilize diagnostic solutions’ gradex ™ authoring software enabling the manufacturing and service phases of vehicle development diagnostics for electronic modules and systems used on vehicles of diagnostic solutions’ customers can be developed and written using the gradex authoring software the actual diagnosis of a customer’s vehicle occurs in the oem dealer’s service bay utilizing a runtime portion of the software to facilitate the service and repair of the vehicle 

broadband test systems 

broadband test provides test systems for testing lines and qualifying lines for digital subscriber line “dsl” telephone networks as telephone companies deploy new technologies to provide “triple play” voice data and video services the tasks of qualifying installing and maintaining subscriber service becomes more complex and costly our systems are used to support the delivery of responsive customer service while improving technician productivity 

our products within the broadband test systems market include 

4tel ™ line service test system 

testing more than 130 million subscriber lines for many of the world’s largest telecommunications companies our 4tel line test service assurance system dramatically improves field repair productivity and reduces call center costs by quickly and accurately determining fault locations in the network and whether or not an expensive field dispatch is required 

celerity ™ dsl test system 

telephone companies need to know which lines in their network are qualified for broadband dsl service before committing service to the consumer our patented celerity system in use on more than 60 million lines 

  

worldwide uses accurate insertion loss length and load coil detection to quickly qualify lines for dsl service enabling targeted marketing programs and low cost provisioning processes celerity also provides ondemand testing for inservice dsl lines to support quick fault isolation and efficient field repair dispatches 

discontinued operations 

on november 30 2005 our connection systems business was sold to amphenol corporation this business designed and manufactured highperformance connection systems including backplane systems printed circuit boards and highspeed highdensity connectors connection systems has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements 

summary of net revenue by reportable segment 

our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of last three years 

 

 sales and distribution 

prices for our systems can reach 2 million or more in 2006 2005 and 2004 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenue in each of the years 2006 2005 and 2004 our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 18 18 and 21 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

direct sales to united states government agencies accounted for less than 3 of consolidated net revenue in 2006 and 2005 and less than 2 in 2004 approximately 23 22 and 23 of assembly test systems’ revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively was to united states government agencies and 20 26 and 24 of assembly test systems’ revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively was to government contractor customers 

we have sales and service offices located throughout north america asia and europe as our customers outside the united states are located primarily in these geographic areas we sell in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force although we conduct some manufacturing activities outside the united states as detailed in “item 2 properties” our manufacturing activities are primarily conducted in the united states 

sales to customers outside the united states accounted for 77 of consolidated net revenue in 2006 78 in 2005 and 79 in 2004 sales to customers located in singapore were 10 13 and 16 of consolidated net revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively sales to customers located in taiwan were 14 12 and 19 of consolidated net revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively sales to customers located in japan were 12 9 and 6 of consolidated net revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site

competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments these competitors include among others advantest corporation verigy inc a new company spun out from agilent 

  

technologies inc credence systems corporation and ltx corporation some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics see also “item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 our backlog of unfilled orders in each of our three reportable segments was as follows 

 

 of the backlog at december 31 2006 approximately 96 of the semiconductor test systems backlog 95 of assembly test systems backlog and 98 of the other test systems backlog is expected to be delivered in 2007 

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

raw materials 

our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers certain of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to our specifications we can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources we may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delays or ceases to deliver products 

intellectual property and licenses 

our development of our products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information our brands and technology we protect our rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes we do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 3800 people since the inception of our business we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances we have no collective bargaining contracts 

engineering and development activities 

the highly technical nature of our products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 were 2087 million 2230 million and 2500 million respectively these expenditures amounted to approximately 15 21 and 18 of consolidated net revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

environmental affairs 

we are subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment we accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated the amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of investigation estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

in 2001 we were designated as a “potentially responsible party” “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arose out of our acquisition of perception laminates inc in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement in 1992 neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site we have asked the state of california to drop the prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so 

in 2006 we received a general notice letter from the us environmental protection agency “epa” which informed us that the epa believes we are a de minimis prp with respect to the casmalia disposal site in california we are currently waiting for further details from the epa regarding the terms of the deminimis settlement offer that we expect to receive 

we believe that we have meritorious defenses against the above unsettled claims and intend to vigorously contest them while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of the unsettled claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise we believe the potential losses associated with all of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period 

ceo certification 

an annual ceo certification was filed with the new york stock exchange by our ceo on june 22 2006 in accordance with the new york stock exchange’s listing standards

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our business 

we are subject to intense competition 

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which 

  

may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics which historically has been highly cyclical 

our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems we manufacture and market we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we cannot assure that the level of revenues or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

our annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability 

the following factors are expected to impact future operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

  

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

a significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on 

  

our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

to a certain extent we are dependant upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements many of our suppliers have implemented cost reduction strategies just as we have to address the slowdowns in the market it may be difficult for these suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers demands 

we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced service providers fail to perform 

in an effort to increase efficiencies and decrease costs we have outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions including information technology to reputable service providers in some cases we have used service providers that we have historically used before but in other cases service providers may be new to us new relationships may initially increase the time for such service providers to learn our systems policies and procedures and create difficulty in effectively implementing a fully outsourced solution many of our outsourced service providers are in foreign countries sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time difficulties their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk additionally there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers it may cause an adverse affect on our operations which could result in a decline in our stock price 

we have significant guarantees and indemnification obligations 

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results for additional information see “note j commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have taken measures to ensure that we are prepared to address slowdowns in the market for our products which could have longterm negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 

we have taken and continue to take measures to ensure that we are prepared to address slowdowns in the market for our products these measures include reducing our workforce the relocation of our headquarters to our north reading massachusetts facility real estate consolidation which resulted in closing andor selling facilities outsourcing general and administrative functions discontinuing certain product lines implementing material cost reduction programs and reducing planned capital expenditures and expense budgets we cannot assure that the measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete to operate effectively to operate profitably during slowdowns or to effectively meet a rapid increase in customer demand these measures may have longterm negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in 

  

our products making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and to quickly respond to customers or competitors in an upward cycle 

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

 

  

  

  

  

 pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2006 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6 2006 both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union other jurisdictions such as china have followed the european union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal ensuring compliance with the rohs directive the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations and financial condition 

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

for example in connection with our august 2000 acquisition of each of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc a complaint was filed on or about september 5 2001 and is now pending on appeal before the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of our then executive officers additionally in 2001 we were designated as a “potentially responsible party” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim also arises out of our acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated october 20 1992 in 2006 we were also notified that we are a de minimis “potentially responsible party” with respect to the casmalia disposal site in california these matters are further described in “item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products “ip” in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or require a significant use of management resources and necessitate a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect our operating results 

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur higher tax rates than we expect 

we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and such other countries we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by our failure to expand operations or earnings in certain countries the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results 

our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles which are difficult to predict 

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies and resulting reductions in customer capital investments the duration of slowdowns in global economies and reductions in customer capital investments which may adversely impact our business are difficult to predict 

acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact our business 

acts of war and terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees facilities customers suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as we and our suppliers sell and manufacture products both in the united states and internationally the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at these locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems we have completed some emergency preparedness planning and have a business continuity plan in case some of these events occur however we cannot be certain that our plans will be effective in the event of a disaster or other situation all of these conditions make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

our basic corporate documents and massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders 

we may acquire new businesses or form strategic alliances in the future and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions 

we may acquire additional businesses form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses if we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate it with our existing operations and company culture we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize value from expected synergies we cannot assure that following an acquisition we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justify the acquisition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the historical information contained in this document the discussion in this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements made pursuant to section 21e of the exchange act that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans expectations and intentions the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as being applicable to all related forwardlooking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forwardlooking statements factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in “item 1a risk factors” and elsewhere herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent 

  

liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes pensions warranties contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

in accordance with the guidance provided by the sec’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 

for equipment that includes software that is incidental to the product revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment or in the case of new products revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 

for multiple element arrangements we defer the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately our postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customer’s ability to use the product we defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with fasb technical bulletin 901 

our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 

for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop no 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” “sop 972” we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” 

  

exists for such elements in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

inventories 

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provision of sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods under this transition method stock based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 includes compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stock based compensation” “sfas 123” stockbased compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted after january 1 2006 is based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of sfas 123r as required by sfas 123r we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stockbased compensation awards expected to vest the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of sfas 123r was not material 

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r we recognized stockbased compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “apb 25” in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” regarding the sec’s interpretation of sfas 123r and the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies we have applied provisions of sab 107 in our adoption of sfas 123r see “note b accounting policies” and “note o stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stockbased compensation 

on may 26 2005 our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding unvested “out of the money” stock options awarded to employees officers and other eligible participants under teradyne’s various stock option plans in effect at that time the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of 1326 the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may 26 2005 and ranged in exercise price from 1373 to 4137 per share as a result of the vesting acceleration options to purchase approximately 76 million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under sfas 123r by approximately 486 million in the aggregate on a pretax basis over fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 

  

income taxes 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance as a result of its review undertaken at december 31 2002 we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions most notably the united states due to the continued uncertainty of realization we maintained our valuation allowance at december 31 2005 and 2006 we do not expect to significantly reduce our valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists including sustained profitability that realization is more likely than not 

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess

results of operations 

discontinued operations 

on october 10 2005 we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement to sell our connection systems segment to amphenol corporation for 3900 million in cash subject to a postclosing net asset value adjustment on november 30 2005 the sale was completed for an adjusted purchase price of 3847 million 

connection systems had revenues for the eleven month period ended november 30 2005 of 3310 million and for the year ended december 31 2004 of 3817 million net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2006 was 39 million relating to a change in estimate to tax expenses from the sale of connection systems under applicable accounting guidance there is an offsetting tax benefit recorded in continuing operations for the same amount this tax provision results from the finalization of the 2005 us tax return net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2005 was 142 million and for the year ended december 31 2004 was 326 million in 2005 we recorded a gain on the sale of connection systems of 1370 million net of a tax provision of 310 million 

in accordance with sfas 144 we are reporting connection systems as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this annual report on form 10k unless indicated otherwise the discussion and amounts provided in this “results of operations” section and elsewhere in this form 10k relate to continuing operations only 

bookings 

our net orders for our three reportable segments for 2006 2005 and 2004 are as follows 

 

 the semiconductor test systems’ increase of 15 in orders from 2005 to 2006 was attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets as customers invested in systemonachip “soc” test equipment principally in the first half of 2006 the flex family of testers has moved into mainstream production and along with the j750 platform contributed to almost all of the growth experienced we also saw a customer shift in orders from period to period with subcontractors making up a larger percentage of orders the 15 decrease in semiconductor test systems bookings from 2004 to 2005 was driven by less demand from our subcon customers primarily in the first half of 2005 the second half of 2005 showed a 50 increase over the first half although total semiconductor test systems bookings declined from 2004 to 2005 flex bookings increased over 100 during this period 

the assembly test systems’ increase of 9 in orders from 2005 to 2006 was primarily driven by demand in the milaero business due to the cyclical nature of the milaero program buys orders in the assembly test systems segment were flat from 2004 to 2005 

the decrease in other test systems’ orders of 17 from 2005 to 2006 resulted from a decrease in broadband test systems offset only slightly by an increase in diagnostic solutions the other test systems bookings increase from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to a large project booked in the second half of 2005 by a major customer in our diagnostic solutions business 

  

our order cancellations and backlog adjustments for our three reportable segments for the last three years are as follows 

 

 semiconductor test systems experienced 152 million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in 2005 approximately 70 of this amount was related to cancellations while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to management’s estimate of what may be canceled in future periods 

our net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows 

 

 for the past three years our backlog of unfilled orders for our three reportable segments is as follows 

 

 customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties in 2006 2005 and 2004 there were no significant cancellation penalties received due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

revenue 

our net revenue for our three reportable segments for 2006 2005 and 2004 is as follows 

 

   

semiconductor test systems’ revenue increase of 34 from 2005 to 2006 can be attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets as customers invested in soc test equipment almost the entire increase is in our flex family and j750 products and is distributed across all regions the increase is partially offset by a decrease of certain nonflex test systems the reduction in bookings at our subcon customers in the semiconductor test systems segment in the second half of 2004 drove the decrease in revenue in the first half of 2005 the bookings reduction was primarily the result of lower utilization of our testers at our subcon customers 

the assembly test systems increase of 6 from 2005 to 2006 in revenue was primarily driven by the incircuit commercial test systems market revenue in the assembly test systems segment was relatively flat from 2004 to 2005 

the increase in other test systems’ revenue resulted from a strong increase in diagnostic solutions sales due primarily to the vehicle measurement module product line offset by a decrease in broadband test systems sales other test systems revenue was relatively flat from 2004 to 2005 

our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years 

 

 our net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows 

 

 our product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows 

 

 service revenue is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support 

in the past three years no single customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net revenue in 2006 2005 and 2004 our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 18 18 and 21 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

  

gross margin 

 

 the increase in gross margin of approximately 10 points from 2005 to 2006 was the result of several factors an increase in semiconductor test systems sales volume contributed 4 points a shift in product mix within semiconductor test systems contributed 2 points an improvement in service margins primarily within semiconductor test systems contributed 2 points the remaining 2 point increase was due to lower inventory provisions in 2006 as we recorded a 385 million charge for nonflex products in the semiconductor test systems segment in 2005 compared to an 80 million charge for nonflex products in 2006 

the decrease in gross margin from 2004 to 2005 was the result of several factors a reduction in semiconductor test systems sales volume contributed 4 points a 385 million inventory provision recorded in semiconductor test systems for the writedown of excess nonflex inventory contributed 35 points and a shift in product mix within semiconductor test contributed 15 points these decreases were offset in part by lower variable employee compensation which contributed 1 point 

the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows 

 

 we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value these writeoffs and writedowns consist of raw materials and components sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision which is recorded in cost of revenues during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we sold inventory that was previously reserved which had a favorable gross margin impact of 28 million 15 million and 13 million respectively 

during the year ended december 31 2006 we recorded inventory provisions in cost of revenues of 147 million of which 117 million was for excess inventory and 30 million was for obsolete inventory of the 147 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 115 million related to semiconductor test systems including an 80 million provision for the writedown of excess nonflex inventory 07 million related to assembly test division and 25 million related to other test systems 

  

during the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded inventory provisions of 493 million in cost of revenues of which 369 million was for excess inventory and 124 million was for obsolete inventory of the 493 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 456 million related to semiconductor test systems including a 385 million provision for the writedown of excess nonflex inventory 29 million related to assembly test systems and 08 million related to other test systems 

during the year ended december 31 2004 we recorded inventory provisions of 97 million in cost of revenues of which 35 million was for excess inventory and 62 million was for obsolete inventory of the 97 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 62 million related to semiconductor test systems 30 million related to assembly test systems and 05 million related to other test systems 

we scrapped 309 million 343 million and 421 million of inventory which had been previously writtendown or writtenoff during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we have no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory 

as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we had inventory reserves for amounts which have been writtendown or writtenoff of 1393 million and 1584 million respectively of the reserves at december 31 2006 130 million 488 million 53 million and 722 million relate to inventory provisions recorded in 2006 2005 2004 and prior to 2004 respectively 

engineering and development 

 

 during 2006 and 2005 we reduced our levels of investment in engineering and development spending more than 80 of our total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test systems segment where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between 150 and 250 million during 2005 semiconductor test systems completed its ultraflex platform development and shifted its focus to increasing the instrumentation set on its flex test platform ultraflex and flex which requires lower levels of engineering and development expenditures during 2004 semiconductor test systems reduced the number of platforms under major development which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms 

the decrease of 143 million in engineering and development spending from 2005 to 2006 consists of the following amounts 

 

  

 these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

 the decrease of 270 million in engineering and development spending from 2004 to 2005 consists of the following amounts 

 

  

  

   

selling and administrative 

 

 the increase in selling and administrative spending of 362 million from 2005 to 2006 consists of the following 

 

  

  

 these increase were partially offset by the following 

 

  

 the decrease in selling and administrative spending of 16 million from 2004 to 2005 is due primarily to an 87 million decrease in variable compensation offset by a 55 million increase in sales support spending for the flex platform and a 16 million increase in salaries and fringe benefits due to salary increases 

restructuring and other net 

in response to a downturn in the industry we initiated restructuring activities in 2002 across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations further actions were initiated in 2003 to a lesser extent in 2004 2005 and in 2006 additionally in 2005 and 2006 as part of our facility consolidation we began selling certain real estate the tables below represent activity related to these actions the remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in the accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the other longterm accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2012 we expect to pay out approximately 24 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months our future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of 127 million as of december 31 2006 we have subleased approximately 15 of our unoccupied space as of december 31 2006 and are actively attempting to sublease the remaining space 

2006 activities 

 

   

during the year ended december 31 2006 we recorded the following activity related to the 2006 restructuring activities 

 

  

  

 the restructuring actions taken during the year ended december 31 2006 are expected to generate quarterly cost savings of approximately 24 million across all segments 

2005 activities 

 

 during the year ended december 31 2005 and subsequently we recorded the following activity related to the 2005 restructuring activities 

 

  

  

  

  

   

2004 activities 

 

 during the year ended december 31 2004 and subsequently we recorded the following activity related to the 2004 restructuring activities 

 

  

  

 pre2004 activities 

 

 during the year ended december 31 2004 and subsequently we recorded the following related to the pre2004 restructuring activities 

 

   

  

  

 interest income and expense 

 

 the increase in interest income from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributable to higher cash balances primarily from the proceeds received from the divestiture of connection systems the increase in interest income from 2004 to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates 

the decrease in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 was due primarily to the repayment of our 375 senior convertible notes the “notes” in the fourth quarter of 2006 and repurchases made earlier in the year the decrease in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to the repurchase of 200 million and 715 million of our notes in the first and fourth quarters of 2005 respectively 

other income and expense net 

other income and expense net for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 includes the following 

 

   income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 

 

   

the change to an income position from 2005 to 2006 was mainly attributable to increased sales in the semiconductor test systems segment and to a lesser extent gains on the sale of real estate primarily in the semiconductor test systems segment and additional interest income net in corporate of 320 million the change to a loss position from 2004 to 2005 was mainly attributable to decreased sales in the semiconductor test systems segment 

income taxes 

during 2006 the income tax expense from continuing operations totaled 278 million the expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes offset by benefits from a 60 million credit related to us pension funding and the settlement of a california income tax audit for 1998 through 2000 

for the year ended december 31 2005 there was a tax benefit from continuing operations that totaled 197 million under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” a benefit for 292 million was recognized for losses relating to 2005 continuing operations as a result of the sale of connection systems there was an equal and offsetting tax provision in the gain on sale of connection system in discontinued operations the remaining portion of the net tax benefit includes a tax provision that related primarily to foreign taxes for the year ended december 31 2004 tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes and also included an irs settlement related to the closing out of tax years 1999 through 2001 

contractual obligations 

the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

     

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased 169 million in 2006 from 2005 to 9446 million cash activity for 2006 2005 and 2004 was as follows in millions 

 

 changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired provided cash of 1722 million in 2006 primarily due to a decrease of accounts receivable balances of 733 million resulting mostly from the decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 and to a lesser extent a decrease in days sales outstanding based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues from 61 days in 2005 to 55 days in 2006 additionally there was a decrease in inventory of 785 million due to shorter final cycle times with our flex products and an increase of 328 million in accrued income taxes due to higher foreign taxes in 2006 the increase of cash flow from changes in accounts receivable inventory and accrued taxes was partially offset by retirement plan contributions of 302 million of which 200 million was a contribution to our us qualified pension plan changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of 538 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of 630 million and retirement plan contributions of 401 million partially offset by a 705 million decrease in inventory changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of 237 million in 2004 primarily due to retirement plan contributions of 388 million 

investing activities consist of purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities proceeds from the sale of businesses proceeds from asset disposals proceeds from the sale of product lines cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets capital expenditures were 1104 million in 2006 1135 million in 2005 and 1546 million in 2004 capital expenditures decreased by 411 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a decrease of internally manufactured systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in the semiconductor test systems segment of approximately 202 million additions of internally manufactured systems peaked in 2004 due to the introduction of the flex test platform the remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across teradyne proceeds from asset disposals were 846 million and 340 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively and consist of sales of real estate investing activities of the discontinued operation provided 3664 million of cash in 2005 in november of 2005 we sold connection systems to amphenol corporation for net proceeds of 3847 million 

financing activities include issuance of our common stock repurchases of teradyne’s common stock as well as repayments of debt during 2006 2005 and 2004 repayments of longterm debt used cash of 3046 million 987 million and 115 million respectively upon maturity we paid off the outstanding balance of our 

  

outstanding notes approximately 261 million aggregate principal in the fourth quarter of 2006 we repurchased portions of our outstanding notes in the first and third quarters of 2006 in the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and the third quarter of 2004 during 2006 2005 and 2004 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated 233 million 347 million and 303 million respectively 

in july 2006 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under the program we may spend up to an aggregate of 400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market purchases in privately negotiated transactions or through other appropriate means through july 2008 shares are to be repurchased at our discretion subject to market conditions and other factors during 2006 we repurchased 106 million shares of common stock for 1376 million for an average price of 1296 subsequently we have repurchased 02 million shares of common stock for 24 million through february 28 2007 

on october 24 2001 we issued 400 million principal amount of the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of 389 million the notes were convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2600 per share which was equal to a conversion rate of approximately 384615 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes we made annual interest payments of 15 million paid semiannually on the notes commencing on april 15 2002 

on august 18 2004 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 10150 of the principal amount the board subsequently amended its authorization on october 21 2005 to authorize repurchases through open market purchases privately negotiated transaction auctions by redemption pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture or other means as determined by our ceo or cfo at prices below 10075 of the principal amount the 100 million authorization for repurchase was fully utilized by management during the third quarter of 2004 and the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to repurchase 85 million 200 million and 715 million of the notes respectively the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the return we would earn on high grade investment securities on january 26 2006 management was given further authorization by our board to repurchase up to the full 300 million of the principal amount that remained outstanding under the notes through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon during 2006 we repurchased notes of 150 million in the first quarter 240 million in the third quarter and we repaid the remaining 261 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 

on february 22 2007 we announced the signing of a definitive agreement with mosaid technologies inc of ottawa canada to acquire enabling test technology for a purchase price of 17 million the transaction is expected to close in march 2007 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of 9446 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the foreseeable future inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

retirement plans 

we adopted the funded status recognition provision of sfas 158 effective december 31 2006 this standard amends sfas 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by sfas 158 the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 for other postretirement benefit plans the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the 

accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 

our pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 119 million for the year 

  

ended december 31 2006 the largest portion of our 2006 pension expense was 41 million for our us qualified pension plan which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected return on plan assets for our us qualified pension plan assets of 75 in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review we believe that 75 was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2006 we will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust these returns as necessary 

the current asset allocation for our us qualified pension plan is 493 invested in equity securities and 507 invested in fixed income securities which is in accordance with the plan’s asset allocation requirements our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2006 was virtually identical to the plan’s asset allocation model our investment manager regularly reviews our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2006 under the us qualified pension plan we had cumulative gains of approximately 113 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index formerly salomon brothers pension liability index which was at 59 at december 31 2006 up from 555 at december 31 2005 as a result we selected 60 for its december 31 2006 discount rate which was up from 55 as of december 31 2005 the duration of the citigroup pension liability index at december 31 2006 was 159 years which approximates the duration of the portfolio of pension liabilities we estimate that our pension expense for the us qualified pension plan will be approximately 10 million in 2007 the pension expense estimate for 2007 is based on a 60 discount rate future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans as of december 31 2006 we had unrecognized pension losses of 594 million of which 444 million is for the us plan 

we performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended december 31 2006 if we changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 

 

 our funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible the assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities the value of our us qualified pension plan assets has increased from 2082 million at december 31 2005 to 2490 million at december 31 2006 our contributions and investment performance have eliminated the deficit of our us qualified pension plan net of benefit obligations of 202 million at december 31 2005 and created a surplus of 315 million at december 31 2006 during 2006 we contributed 200 million to the us qualified pension plan based upon the plan’s funded status as of december 31 2006 we do not expect to make any contributions in 2007 to this plan 

  

equity compensation plans 

in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in “note o stock based compensation” in notes to consolidated financial statements we have the 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan the “2006 equity plan” under which equity securities are authorized for issuance the 2006 equity plan was approved by stockholders on may 25 2006 the 2006 equity plan replaces our 1996 nonemployee director stock option plan our 1997 employee stock option plan and our 1991 employee stock option plan each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 equity plan we may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise vesting or expiration 

the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31 2006 share numbers in thousands 

 

     the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees officers directors consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan is 12000000 shares of our common stock the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stockbased awards in the form of 1 nonqualified and incentive stock options 2 stock appreciation rights 3 restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards 4 phantom stock and 5 other stockbased awards awards may be tied to timebased vesting schedules andor performancebased vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors which administers the 2006 equity plan awards may be made to any employee officer consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries as well as to our directors the maximum number of shares of stockbased awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2000000 shares of common stock the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 24 2016 

as mentioned above our 1997 employee stock option plan the “1997 plan” was terminated on may 25 2006 when we adopted our 2006 equity plan our 1997 plan was not approved by our shareholders the 1997 

  

plan allowed us to issue options and stock awards including restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees consultants and directors and also to issue deferred stock units to directors the compensation committee of our board of directors administered the 1997 plan and specified at the time of grant of an award the pertinent terms of such award including if such award is an option whether it was an incentive stock option or nonqualified stock option the exercise price and vesting provisions under the 1997 plan as of december 31 2006 there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 14911000 shares outstanding restricted stock units which can convert into an aggregate of 1030000 shares and 20774 shares reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding director deferred stock units most of the outstanding options issued under the 1997 plan vest in equal installments over two or four years and have a maximum term of either five or seven years the restricted stock units issued under the 1997 plan vest in equal installments over two years 

as of december 31 2006 total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested awards and options totaled 157 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 09 years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend concentration of credit risk 

financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments forward currency contracts and accounts receivable we maintain cash and marketable securities investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities rated aa or higher which have minimal credit risk we place forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 

exchange rate risk management 

we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the european euro great britain pound japanese yen and the taiwan dollar these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures in addition we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income we do not engage in currency speculation 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2006 and 2005 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk management 

we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates investments with interest rate risk include short and longterm marketable securities 

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10 fluctuation in interest rates was assumed market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio on these bases the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is 26 million and 13 million as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and shareholders of teradyne inc the “company”

consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule 

in our opinion the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under item 15a1 present fairly in all material respects the financial position of teradyne and its subsidiaries at december 31 2006 and 2005 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in addition in our opinion the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15a2 presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements these financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the company’s management our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement an audit of financial statements includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion 

as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements the company changed the manner in which it accounts for sharebased compensation in 2006 and the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans effective december 31 2006 

internal control over financial reporting 

also in our opinion management’s assessment included in management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 9a that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso is fairly stated in all material respects based on those criteria furthermore in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit we conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects an audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets doubtful accounts income taxes pensions warranties and loss contingencies management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 

revenue recognition 

in accordance with the guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to teradyne’s customers upon shipment in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur 

  

teradyne inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

   

for equipment that includes software that is incidental to the product revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment or in the case of new products revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 

for multiple element arrangements teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of teradyne teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately teradyne’s postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customer’s ability to use the product teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and teradyne defers revenue in accordance with fasb technical bulletin 901 

teradyne’s products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

teradyne generally does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products 

for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement of position no 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop no 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” “sop 972” teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for such elements in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageof completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be 

  

teradyne inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

   

reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order as of december 31 2006 and 2005 teradyne had 169 million and 243 million in unbilled amounts on longterm contracts included in accounts receivable respectively these amounts will be billed on a milestone basis in accordance with contractual terms 

inventories 

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value teradyne records a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or writeoffs are identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets leasehold improvements and major renewals are capitalized and included in property plant and equipment accounts while expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense when assets are retired the assets and related allowances for depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 

teradyne provides for depreciation of its assets principally on the straight line method with the cost of the assets being charged to expense over their useful lives as follows 

 

 test systems manufactured internally are used by teradyne for customer evaluations and manufacturing and support of its customers teradyne depreciates the test systems manufactured internally over a sixyear life to cost of revenues and selling and administrative expenses teradyne often sells internally manufactured test equipment to customers upon the sale of an internally manufactured test system the net book value of the system is transferred to inventory and expensed as cost of revenues the net book value of internally manufactured test systems sold in the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 was 400 million 476 million and 434 million respectively 

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

teradyne accounts for its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the 

  

teradyne inc 

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

   

book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” teradyne reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset if an impairment is indicated the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment if any contain management’s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time 

engineering and development costs 

teradyne’s products are highly technical in nature and require a large and continuing engineering and development effort software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to expense software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized until the product is available for release to customers to date the period between achieving technological feasibility and general availability of the product has been short and software development costs eligible for capitalization have not been material engineering and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of salaries contractor fees building costs depreciation and tooling costs 

advertising costs 

teradyne expenses all advertising costs as incurred advertising costs were 27 million 24 million and 31 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r teradyne accounted for its equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations “apb 25” in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” regarding the sec’s interpretation of sfas 123r and the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies teradyne has applied provisions of sab 107 in its adoption of sfas 123r the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of sfas 123r was not material 

the proforma table below reflects the effect of recording stockbased compensation for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 had teradyne applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123

weighted average assumptions to determine net periodic benefit cost 

 

 weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations 

 

 in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations based on this review teradyne believes that 75 was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2006 for the us qualified pension plan 

teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2006 under the us qualified pension plan teradyne had cumulative gains of approximately 113 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index formerly salomon brothers pension liability index which was at 59 at december 31 2006 up from 555 at december 31 2005 as a result teradyne selected 60 for its december 31 2006 discount rate which was up from 55 as of december 31 2005 

plan assets 

teradyne’s weighted average asset allocation at december 31 2006 and 2005 by asset category is as follows

income investments the investment portfolio will not at any time have a direct investment in teradyne stock it may have an indirect investment in teradyne stock if one of the funds selected by the investment manager invests in teradyne stock 

the target asset allocation and index for each asset category for the us qualified pension plan per policy for the portfolio is as follows 

 

 teradyne’s investment manager regularly reviews teradyne’s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances teradyne’s portfolio to ensure alignment to the targeted allocation 

the investment return objectives are to achieve a rate of return which exceeds the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index by 3 per year and to avoid excessive volatility and produce a rate of return that at least matches the policy index identified above 

the manager’s investment performance is reviewed at least annually results for the total portfolio and for each major category of assets are evaluated in comparison with appropriate market indices the policy index other similarly managed portfolios and the consumer price index 

the assets of teradyne’s foreign pension plans are invested in funds which seek to combine longterm growth potential offered through equity exposure with the relative security provided by equity bonds and cash 

contributions 

teradyne’s funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible during 2006 2005 and 2004 teradyne contributed 302 million 401 million and 388 million to the plans respectively based upon the plan’s funded status as of december 31 2006 teradyne does not expect to make any contributions in 2007 to this plan

semiconductor test systems 

  

teradyne produces semiconductor test systems which test a wide variety of “system on a chip” “soc” semiconductor devices during the manufacturing process the test systems provided by teradyne are used both for wafer level and device package testing these devices contain integrated analog digital and memory functions which allow an entire system or subsystem to reside on a single device or “chip” these chips are used in automotive communications consumer computer and electronic game applications among others soc devices span a broad range of functionality from very simple lowcost devices such as appliance microcontrollers operational amplifiers or voltage regulators to complex digital signal processors and microprocessors semiconductor test systems are sold to integrated device manufacturers “idms” that integrate the fabrication of silicon wafers into their business “fabless” companies that outsource the manufacturing of silicon wafers “foundries” that cater to the processing and manufacturing of silicon wafers and subcontractors “subcons” that provide test and assembly services for the final packaged devices to both fabless companies and idms fabless companies perform the design of integrated circuits without manufacturing capabilities and use foundries for wafer manufacturing and subcons for test and assembly these customers obtain the overall benefit of comprehensively testing advanced performance devices while reducing their total costs associated with testing by using teradyne’s semiconductor test systems to 

  

      

teradyne has made significant investments in the last several years to introduce the new flex ™ test platform architecture the flex test platform architecture advances core teradyne technologies to produce test equipment that is designed for high efficiency multisite testing multisite testing involves the simultaneous testing of more devices and functions in “parallel” leading semiconductor manufacturers are using multisite testing to significantly improve their “cost of test” cot economics the flex test platform multisite throughput performance is enabled by teradyne’s advanced instrument control technology and unique synclink ™ instrument synchronization capability in addition our igxl ™ pure parallel software enables developers to automatically generate multisite code these capabilities have allowed our customers to develop hundreds of multisite programs in the last year 

  

the flex test platform architecture is applied across the spectrum of semiconductor devices with the broadest coverage and expandability of any production test platform the flex test platform’s scalability is enabled by a comprehensive suite of ac dc and digital instrumentation in addition the flex test platform architecture delivers singleboard highdensity instruments and a universal slot test head the combination of single board instruments with a universal slot provides the user the flexibility to install the instrument into any of the tester “slots” adding a level of adaptability to production testing the flex test platform also employs 

  

openflex™ an open architecture initiative that allows for the straightforward integration of customer and thirdparty instrumentation to expand and customize the flex platform teradyne is working with several third parties and customers to develop instrumentation and has third party instruments in production at customers 

  

initially a majority of flex test platform purchases were made by idms but over the last year the percentage of purchases has been shifting towards subcons the flex test platform has become a widely used test solution at subcons and test houses by providing versatile testers that can handle the widest range of devices allowing subcons to leverage their capital investments the broad consumer automotive and broadband markets have been driving most of the device volume growth in the semiconductor industry these markets include cell phones set top boxes hdtvs game controllers computer graphics and automotive controllers to name a few these end use markets are continuing to be a strong growth driver for the flex test platform family of products because they require a wide range of technologies and instrument coverage the flex test platform has an installed base of more than 500 customer systems to date 

  

the flex test platform family of testers are optimized for customers’ performance and capital cost requirements the ultraflex ™ test system offers the digital speed and pin count needed for multisite test applications of complex highperformance devices operating at greater than 200 mhz ultraflex instruments can deliver over 2200 pins at gigahertz speeds with jitter injection and measurement including highspeed serial test over 6 gbps with standard bus protocols the flex test system delivers lowcost production test for most digital analog mixedsignal soc and sip systeminpackage devices operating at or below 200mhz digital speeds the microflex ™ test system is a smaller version of the flex test platform designed for applications where limited production space and lower cost are critical concerns the microflex system delivers a lowcost production test for a broad range of devices operating at or below 200mhz digital speeds especially for the consumer wireless and automotive market segments 

  

the teradyne j750 test system shares the igxl software environment with the family of flex test platform systems this system is designed to address the highest volume semiconductor devices such as microcontrollers that are at the heart of almost every consumer electronics product from small appliances to automotive engine controllers these devices are produced in enormous quantities j750 test systems combine compact packaging high throughput and ease of production test these benefits are possible due to the high level of integration in the design a single circuit board in the j750 test system provides up to 64 digital inputoutput channels the j750 has met with success in the marketplace and has an installed base of over 1900 systems the j750 platform technology also has been used to create the teradyne ip750 image sensor test system the ip750 is focused on testing image sensor devices used in digital cameras and other imaging products 

  

adding to the offerings of the flex test platform architecture are a number of established systems that teradyne continues to offer the catalyst ™ and catalysttiger test systems are designed to test a broad range of higher performance soc devices the catalyst is designed to test devices requiring data rates up to 400 mega bits per second “bps” with a broad range of analog performance over 1500 catalyst systems are in use today at idms and subcons testing integrated circuits for dvd players wireless cellular phones networking appliances telecommunications systems computer peripherals and many other applications 

  

the “tiger” version of catalyst provides similar analog capability but extends the digital performance up to 32 giga bps on up to 1264 inputoutput channels this extended digital performance enables complete functional testing of the world’s most demanding soc and highspeed logic integrated circuits used in computer graphics personal computer chip set microprocessor and networking applications over 100 tiger systems are installed at idms and subcons around the world 

  

assembly test systems 

  

teradyne also produces a variety of test and inspection systems sold to many of the industry’s leading printed circuit board “pcb” original equipment manufacturers “oems” and subcons around the world the 

  

demand for these products is being driven by rapid technological advances and the constant need to improve assembly quality because today’s pcbs and electronic assemblies bundle more functionality than ever before they contain highly integrated circuits and more complex components that operate faster use lower voltages and are more susceptible to assembly problems the teradyne assembly test and inspection systems combine the advanced diagnostic hardware and operating software needed to ensure product quality sustain high manufacturing yield verify functional operation diagnose faults and effectively reduce manufacturing costs our products are sold to the electronics manufacturers of cell phones servers computers internet switches automobiles and military avionics systems worldwide 

  

incircuit test systems 

  

teradyne manufactures incircuit test “ict” systems that are used to assess electrical interconnections verify interoperation and find faulty circuits aboard fully assembled and soldered pcbs fast accurate and costeffective diagnostic capabilities are hallmark features of teradyne’s ict systems including the teststation ™ and spectrum ™ product families used in a variety of inline highvolume pcb test applications these systems are also used in sample test environments for prototype testing and earlystage pcb design and development supporting technologies such as teradyne’s patented safetest ™ technology allow teststation users to safely troubleshoot the lowvoltage components and interconnects commonly found in batterypowered portable consumer electronics and lowpower commercial equipment in addition to standard ict equipment teradyne offers combinational test platforms and handlerready inline test systems for highvolume board manufacturing 

  

imaging inspection systems 

  

pcb assembly trends are expected to force board manufacturers to reassess their inspection strategies due to the growing use of highly integrated socs and higher density doublesided boards half of all solder connections are expected to be invisible to optical inspection systems by 2007 combine this growing loss of visual and electrical access with the difficulties associated with detecting leadfree solder voids on doublesided boards and the inspection problem is compounded 

  

teradyne’s newly introduced xstation ™ mx a fully automated xray inspection “axi” system solves these problems when inspecting pcbs for manufacturing defects including improper component placement and orientation electrical opens and shorts and a host of other board quality issues the xstation mx uses clearvue ™  a patented threedimensional xray imaging technique to more accurately detect subtle defects and manufacturing flaws even as board complexities grow 

  

militaryaerospace test systems  instrumentation 

  

teradyne’s expertise in the test and diagnosis of pcbs and subsystems has proven to be essential in supporting the everdemanding military and aerospace markets teradyne’s test solutions for these markets include highperformance systems instruments and software solutions that manufacturers and repair depots all depend on to ensure the readiness of commercial and military avionics systems 

  

the swift pace of technological advances continues in the military and aerospace market resulting in electronics assemblies of greater complexity speed and accuracy new programs from tactical aircraft to missile systems as well as widespread enhancement programs continue to fuel the demand for high performance test systems teradyne is a leading provider of test instrumentation and systems with performance well suited to the demands of militaryaerospace electronics manufacturers and repair depots worldwide success in this market is illustrated by teradyne’s penetration into major department of defense programs across all us military service branches and many allied military services worldwide 

  

diagnostic solutions 

  

diagnostic solutions provides electronic test and diagnostic systems to the automotive oems and their major subcontractors the systems are used throughout the vehicle’s lifecycle from design through manufacture to after sale service and consist of highly integrated software and hardware components as the number and complexity of electronic systems and embedded software proliferate in vehicles the ability to manufacture and service those vehicles becomes increasingly dependent on electronic diagnostic equipment diagnostic solutions’ products fall into two categories 

  

oem service diagnostics 

  

oem dealer service technicians use diagnostic solutions systems to find faults in vehicles in use by their customers and to reduce oem warranty costs historically the focus has been on fixing faults in the service bay but is now growing to include constant monitoring of the vehicle to predict and prevent failure 

  

vehicle configuration and test solutions 

  

diagnostic solutions’ vcats ™ products are used on automotive and major automotive subassembly production lines diagnostic solutions’ vcats connects to the vehicle to test and program or “configure” the electronic systems on vehicles these vehicle electronic systems include engine control modules and subsystems such as braking navigation and air conditioning diagnostic solutions is also able to link to an oem’s manufacturing control system in order to provide statistical quality reports to operators and management 

  

both vcats and oem service diagnostics products utilize diagnostic solutions’ gradex ™ authoring software enabling the manufacturing and service phases of vehicle development diagnostics for electronic modules and systems used on vehicles of diagnostic solutions’ customers can be developed and written using the gradex authoring software the actual diagnosis of a customer’s vehicle occurs in the oem dealer’s service bay utilizing a runtime portion of the software to facilitate the service and repair of the vehicle 

  

broadband test systems 

  

broadband test provides test systems for testing lines and qualifying lines for digital subscriber line “dsl” telephone networks as telephone companies deploy new technologies to provide “triple play” voice data and video services the tasks of qualifying installing and maintaining subscriber service becomes more complex and costly teradyne’s systems are used to support the delivery of responsive customer service while improving technician productivity 

  

teradyne products within the broadband test systems market include 

  

4tel ™ line service test system 

  

testing more than 130 million subscriber lines for many of the world’s largest telecommunications companies teradyne’s 4tel line test service assurance system dramatically improves field repair productivity and reduces call center costs by quickly and accurately determining fault locations in the network and whether or not an expensive field dispatch is required 

  

celerity ™ dsl test system 

  

telephone companies need to know which lines in their network are qualified for broadband dsl service before committing service to the consumer teradyne’s patented celerity system in use on more than 60 million lines worldwide uses accurate insertion loss length and load coil detection to quickly qualify lines for dsl service enabling targeted marketing programs and low cost provisioning processes celerity also provides ondemand testing for inservice dsl lines to support quick fault isolation and efficient field repair dispatches

on november 30 2005 teradyne’s connection systems business was sold to amphenol corporation this business designed and manufactured highperformance connection systems including backplane systems printed circuit boards and highspeed highdensity connectors connection systems has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements 

  

summary of net revenue by reportable segment 

  

teradyne’s three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of last three years 

  

   

sales and distribution 

  

prices for teradyne’s systems can reach 3 million or more in 2005 2004 and 2003 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of teradyne’s consolidated net revenue in each of the years 2005 2004 and 2003 teradyne’s three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 18 21 and 17 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

  

direct sales to united states government agencies accounted for less than 3 of consolidated net revenue in 2005 and less than 2 in 2004 and 2003 approximately 22 23 and 12 of assembly test systems’ revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively was to united states government agencies and 26 24 and 28 of assembly test systems’ revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively was to government contractor customers 

  

teradyne has sales and service offices located throughout north america asia and europe as teradyne’s customers outside the united states are located primarily in these geographic areas teradyne sells in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force although teradyne conducts some manufacturing activities outside the united states as detailed in “item 2 properties” teradyne’s manufacturing activities are primarily conducted in the united states 

  

sales to customers outside the united states accounted for 78 of consolidated net revenue in 2005 79 in 2004 and 73 in 2003 sales to customers located in singapore were 13 16 and 14 of consolidated net revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively sales to customers located in taiwan were 12 19 and 12 of consolidated net revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively sales to customers located in japan were 9 6 and 11 of consolidated net revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site 

  

we are subject to the inherent risks involved in international trade such as 

  

        

    

we attempt to reduce the effects of currency fluctuations by hedging those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and by conducting the majority of our international transactions in us dollars or dollar equivalents see also “item 1a risk factors” and “note f financial instruments” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

competition 

  

teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its reportable segments these competitors include among others advantest corporation agilent technologies inc credence systems corporation and ltx corporation some of teradyne’s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers some of teradyne’s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those teradyne currently offers teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of teradyne’s products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified pricebased competition which could materially adversely affect teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations see also “item 1a risk factors” 

  

backlog 

  

at december 31 2005 and 2004 teradyne’s backlog of unfilled orders in each of its three reportable segments was as follows 

  

   

of the backlog at december 31 2005 approximately 96 of the semiconductor test systems backlog 98 of assembly test systems backlog and 94 of the other test systems backlog is expected to be delivered in 2006 

  

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders teradyne’s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

raw materials 

  

teradyne’s products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers certain of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to teradyne’s specifications teradyne can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of teradyne’s components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources teradyne could experience a temporary adverse impact if any of its sole source suppliers ceased to 

  

deliver products any prolonged inability to obtain adequate supplies or any other circumstances that would require teradyne to seek alternative sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations see also “item 1a risk factors” 

  

intellectual property and licenses 

  

teradyne’s development of its products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information its brands and technology teradyne protects its rights in proprietary information brands and technology through various methods such as 

  

        

however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit teradyne’s proprietary information and its brands in countries where teradyne lacks enforceable intellectual property rights or enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes while teradyne does not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to its business if a significant portion of teradyne’s intellectual property or proprietary rights is invalidated or ineffective teradyne’s business could be materially adversely affected see also “item 1a risk factors” 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2005 teradyne employed approximately 4400 people including approximately 400 temporary employees since the inception of teradyne’s business there have been no work stoppages or other labor disturbances teradyne has no collective bargaining contracts 

  

engineering and development activities 

  

the highly technical nature of teradyne’s products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were 2230 million 2500 million and 2442 million respectively these expenditures amounted to approximately 21 18 and 25 of consolidated net revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

environmental affairs 

  

teradyne is subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment teradyne accrues for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that teradyne will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated the amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of investigation estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of teradyne’s operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

  

in 2001 teradyne was designated as a “potentially responsible party” “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arose out of teradyne’s acquisition of perception laminates inc in august 

  

2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july 30 1992 neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site teradyne has asked the state of california to drop the prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so management does not believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such outcome would not have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position or results of operations these matters are further described in “item 3 legal proceedings”

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

risks associated with the sale of our connection systems segment 

  

the sale of connection systems may affect future results of operations or financial condition 

  

we cannot assure you that the sale of connection systems will enable us to achieve our goal of successfully focusing on our core business or that this strategic realignment will be beneficial to our business or financial condition 

  

we have agreed with amphenol corporation to retain the responsibility for certain specific contingent liabilities related to the business including environmental liabilities designated trade and customs liabilities and liabilities associated with certain pending litigation and we may also be subject to potential claims by amphenol that the representations and warranties we made about connection systems were inaccurate the resolution of these contingencies and claims may have a material adverse effect on our continuing results of operations or financial conditions 

  

risks associated with our business 

  

we are subject to intense competition 

  

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics which historically has been highly cyclical 

  

our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns and the effects of hostile acts historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems we manufacture and market we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations we may be particularly susceptible to fluctuations due to the recent actions we have taken such as the sale of connection systems in order to focus on our core business we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we cannot assure that the level of revenues or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

  

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

  

our annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability 

  

the following factors are expected to impact future operations 

  

           

in particular due to the introduction of a number of new complex test systems in 2004 and the ongoing introduction of related instrumentation there can be no assurance that we will not experience delays in shipment of our products or that our products will achieve customer acceptance 

  

as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

  

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

  

a significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

  

    

         

in addition an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

  

  

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors including 

  

           

if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

  

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

  

we are also dependent on the financial strength of our suppliers and may be subject to litigation arising from our relationships with suppliers and others there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

we may not be able to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 

  

because we took measures during the past few years to scale back operations and reduce expenses in response to decreased customer demand for our products and services we may not be able to satisfy a rapid increase in customer demand our ability to meet rapid increases in customer demand is also to a certain extent dependant upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to meet increased product or delivery requirements many of which have also implemented cost reduction strategies and over which we have little or no control 

  

we have significant guarantees and indemnification obligations 

  

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness or performance obligations of our subsidiary and affiliate companies we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results for additional information regarding see “note j commitments and contingencies—guarantees and indemnification obligations” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we have taken measures to ensure that we are prepared to address slowdowns in the market for our products which could have longterm negative effects on our business 

  

we have taken and continue to take measures to ensure that we are prepared to address slowdowns in the market for our products these measures include several reductions in our workforce a planned consolidation and relocation of our headquarters to our north reading massachusetts facility in 2006 closing andor selling facilities discontinuing certain product lines implementing material cost reduction programs and reducing planned capital expenditures and expense budgets we cannot assure you that measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete to operate effectively and to operate profitably during slowdowns each measure we have taken could have longterm negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and respond to customers or competitors 

  

we are required to account for stock compensation awards under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense which will adversely affect our operating results 

  

beginning in the first quarter of our 2006 fiscal year we have implemented the new expense recognition standard of financial accounting standards boards “fasb” sfas no 123r revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” under sfas 123r we are required to record in our statement of operations equitybased compensation expense for stock compensation awards including stock options based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant in the year ended december 31 2005 we disclosed pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the grants’ fair value and disclosing the impact on loss income from continuing operations and loss income from continuing operations per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements sfas 123r or any other future laws and regulations requiring us to record the fair value of all stock compensation awards as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations will adversely affect operating results “note b accounting policies” of notes to consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on loss income from continuing operations and loss income from continuing operations per share if it had been in effect during the year ended december 31 2005 the implementation of sfas 123r will result in pretax expense of approximately 70 million in the first quarter of 2006 and approximately 28 million for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

  

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

  

       

pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2005 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

  

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” both the rohs directive and the weee directive will alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union ensuring compliance with the rohs directive and the weee directive and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on our business operations and financial condition for example early compliance with the rohs directive by any of our suppliers could force teradyne to participate in last time buy programs and to accelerate end of life timetables for existing products each of which results in additional costs for teradyne and disrupts existing operations and logistics the weee directive became effective august 13 2005 and the rohs directive will become effective on july 6 2006 

  

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

for example in connection with our august 2000 acquisition of each of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc a complaint was filed on or about september 5 2001 and is now pending on appeal before the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of our then executive officers additionally in 2001 we were designated as a “potentially responsible party” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim also arises out of our acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated october 20 1992 these matters are further described in “item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

  

we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products “ip” in several ways including through patent copyright and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or require a significant use of management resources and necessitate a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

  

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees a decrease in our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles which are difficult to predict 

  

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies and resulting reductions in customer capital investments the duration of slowdowns in global economies and reductions in customer capital investments which may adversely impact our business are difficult to predict 

  

acts of war terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact our business 

  

acts of war and terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees facilities customers suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as we and our suppliers sell and manufacture products both in the united states and internationally the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at these locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems all of these conditions make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

  

our basic corporate documents our stockholder rights plan and massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

on september 5 2001 after our august 2000 acquisition of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc the former owners of those companies filed a complaint against teradyne and two of its then executive officers in the federal district court in san diego california asserting securities fraud and breach of contract related to the acquisition pursuant to motions filed by teradyne and by the plaintiffs the district court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs’ claims granted partial summary judgment against them with respect to their breach of contract claim and denied their motion for reconsideration the only claim that remained before the district court from the original complaint related to an allegation of fraud in connection with the setting of the transaction price on december 27 2004 the plaintiffs voluntarily stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of their remaining claim in the district court without having received any payment or other consideration from teradyne on february 2 2005 the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the district court’s prior orders the appeal is now pending before the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 

  

in 2001 we were designated as a “potentially responsible party” “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arose out of our acquisition of perception laminates in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated october 20 1992 neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site we have asked the state of california to drop the prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so 

  

on april 30 2004 hampshire equity partners ii lp “hep” filed a complaint against teradyne and connection systems a former division of teradyne in the united states district court of the southern district of new york relating to a february 21 2001 investment of 55 million in connector service corporation aka amax plating inc “csc” by hep a supplier to connection systems at the time after csc filed for bankruptcy protection on or about september 24 2003 hep brought suit against teradyne and connection systems asserting fraud and negligence based claims and a claim for intentional interference with economic opportunity in the complaint hep alleged that it relied on statements that a connection systems representative made to hep’s agent during due diligence in its decision to invest in csc hep sought to hold teradyne and connection systems responsible for its decision to invest in csc the losses that it suffered upon the bankruptcy of csc and damages for an unstated amount of not less than 55 million on or about april 7 2005 the district court entered an order allowing teradyne’s motion to dismiss in full and denied hep leave to amend and refile its complaint on may 6 2005 hep filed a notice of appeal from the district court’s order to dismiss on december 20 2005 the court of appeals ruled in our favor by denying hep’s appeal and affirming the district court’s decision to dismiss all claims in the litigation with prejudice 

  

we believe that we have meritorious defenses against the above unsettled claims and intend to vigorously contest them while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of the unsettled claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise we believe the losses associated with all of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period 

  

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as but not limited to patent employment commercial and environmental matters although there can be no assurance there are no such matters pending that we expect to be material with respect to our business financial position or results of operations

the number of record holders of teradyne’s common stock at february 24 2006 was 2874 

  

teradyne has never paid cash dividends because it has been teradyne’s policy to use earnings to finance expansion and growth payment of future cash dividends will rest within the discretion of the board of directors and will depend among other things upon teradyne’s earnings capital requirements and financial condition teradyne presently expects to retain all of its earnings for use in the business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the historical information contained in this document the discussion in this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements made pursuant to section 21e of the exchange act that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of teradyne’s plans expectations and intentions the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as being applicable to all related forwardlooking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form 10k teradyne’s actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forwardlooking statements factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in “item 1a risk factors” and elsewhere herein 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations and financial condition the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results 

  

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes pensions warranties contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in accordance with the guidance provided by the commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to teradyne’s customers upon shipment in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur 

  

for equipment that includes software that is incidental to the product revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment or in the case of new products revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 

  

for multiple element arrangements teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable 

  

and substantially in the control of teradyne teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately teradyne’s postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customer’s ability to use the product teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and teradyne defers revenue in accordance with fasb technical bulletin 901 

  

teradyne’s products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

  

teradyne does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products 

  

for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop no 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” “sop 972” teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for such elements in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

  

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

  

inventories 

  

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

  

equity incentive and stock purchase plans 

  

for periods prior to 2006 teradyne accounts for its equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations “apb 25” teradyne’s employee stock purchase plan is a noncompensatory plan teradyne’s equity incentive plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value 

  

method under the provisions of apb 25 accordingly there has been 08 million of expense in 2005 related to restricted stock units 

  

teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas 123” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stock based compensation – transition and disclosure” “sfas 148” see “note b accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information 

  

teradyne implemented the expense recognition provisions of the fasb’s new standard sfas 123r beginning with the first quarter of its 2006 fiscal year that began on january 1 2006 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 had sfas 123r been effective teradyne would have recognized additional noncash equitybased compensation expense in continuing operations of 903 million 827 million and 768 million respectively applying the provisions of sfas 123 

  

on may 26 2005 the board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding unvested “out of the money” stock options awarded to employees officers and other eligible participants under teradyne’s various stock option plans the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of 1326 the closing price of teradyne’s common stock on the new york stock exchange on may 26 2005 and ranged in exercise price from 1373 to 4137 per share as a result of the vesting acceleration options to purchase approximately 76 million shares became exercisable immediately and teradyne reduced the compensation expense it otherwise would have been required to record under sfas 123r by approximately 486 million in the aggregate on a pretax basis over fiscal years 2006 2007 and 2008 

  

income taxes 

  

on a quarterly basis teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assesses the need for a valuation allowance as a result of its review undertaken at december 31 2002 teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions most notably the united states due to the continued uncertainty of realization teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at december 31 2004 and 2005 teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists including sustained profitability that realization is more likely than not 

  

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

  

teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of teradyne’s use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess

results of operations 

  

discontinued operations 

  

on october 10 2005 teradyne announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to sell its connection systems segment to amphenol corporation for 3900 million in cash subject to a postclosing net asset value adjustment on november 30 2005 the sale was completed for an adjusted purchase price of 3847 million 

  

connection systems had revenues for the eleven month period ended november 30 2005 of 3310 million and for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 of 3817 million and 3572 million respectively net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2005 was 142 million and for the year ended december 31 2004 was 326 million net loss of the discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2003 was 240 million in 2005 teradyne recorded a gain on the sale of connection systems of 1370 million net of a tax provision of 310 million 

  

in accordance with sfas 144 we are reporting connection systems as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this annual report on form 10k unless indicated otherwise the discussion and amounts provided in this “results of operations” section and elsewhere in this form 10k relate to continuing operations only 

  

bookings 

  

teradyne’s net orders for its three reportable segments for 2005 2004 and 2003 are as follows 

  

   

the 15 decrease in semiconductor test systems bookings from 2004 to 2005 was driven by less demand from our subcon customers primarily in the first half of 2005 as they experienced lower capacity utilization the second half of 2005 showed a 50 increase over the first half however with a surge in demand in the automotive disk storage game processors performance consumer and wireless markets although total semiconductor test systems bookings declined from 2004 to 2005 flex bookings increased over 100 during this period 

  

orders in the assembly test systems segment were flat from 2004 to 2005 orders in the assembly test systems segment increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the net increases in the milaero business and increased orders of incircuit products the growth in these areas was offset by a decline in orders resulting from the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual xray and rework product lines in 2003 

  

the other test systems bookings increase from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to a large project booked in the second half of 2005 by a major customer in our diagnostic solutions business other test systems bookings are programrelated and can have significant fluctuations from period to period 

  

teradyne’s order cancellations and backlog adjustments for its three reportable segments for the last three years are as follows 

  

   

semiconductor test systems experienced 152 million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in 2005 approximately 70 of this amount was related to cancellations while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to management’s estimate of what may be canceled in future periods 

  

teradyne’s net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows 

  

   

for the past three years teradyne’s backlog of unfilled orders for its three reportable segments is as follows 

  

   

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties in 2005 2004 and 2003 there were no significant cancellation penalties received due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue 

  

teradyne’s net revenue for its three reportable segments for 2005 2004 and 2003 is as follows 

  

   

the reduction in bookings at our subcon customers in the semiconductor test systems segment in the second half of 2004 drove the decrease in revenue in the first half of 2005 the bookings reduction was primarily the result of lower utilization of teradyne testers at our subcon customers the second half of 2005 showed sales only slightly lower than comparable 2004 levels assembly test systems sales and other test system sales were flat from 2004 to 2005 

  

the increase in assembly test systems sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to increases in both the commercial and milaero businesses commercial business growth was due to increased sales of incircuit test products while the increase in milaero sales was generated by a number of large projects which were undertaken in 2004 these increases were offset in part by decreases from the sale of the manual xray rework and automated optical inspection “aoi” product lines in 2003 

  

teradyne’s three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years 

  

   

teradyne’s net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows 

  

   

teradyne’s product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows 

  

   

service revenue is derived from the servicing of teradyne’s installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support 

  

in the past three years no single customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 teradyne’s three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 18 21 and 17 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

  

gross margin 

  

   

the decrease in gross margin from 2004 to 2005 was the result of several factors a reduction in semiconductor test systems sales volume contributed 4 points a 385 million inventory provision recorded in semiconductor test systems for the writedown of excess nonflex inventory contributed 35 points and a shift in product mix within semiconductor test contributed 15 points these decreases were offset in part by lower variable employee compensation which contributed 1 point 

  

the gross margin improvement of 95 points from 2003 to 2004 was a result of several factors an improvement of 6 points is due to a volume increase from year to year coupled with lower fixed manufacturing costs primarily resulting from past restructuring actions an additional 5 points can be attributed to a more favorable mix of revenues with higher margin configurations as well as more product revenue as product margins are higher than service margins higher variable compensation expense in 2004 had a 15 point unfavorable impact on margins year over year 

  

the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows 

  

   

we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value these writeoffs and writedowns consist of raw materials and components sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision which is recorded in cost of revenues 

  

during the year ended december 31 2005 teradyne recorded inventory provisions of 493 million in cost of revenues of which 369 million was for excess inventory and 124 million was for obsolete inventory of the 493 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 455 million related to semiconductor test systems including a 385 million provision for the writedown of excess nonflex inventory 29 million related to assembly test systems and 08 million related to other test systems 

  

during the year ended december 31 2004 teradyne recorded inventory provisions of 97 million in cost of revenues of which 35 million was for excess inventory and 62 million was for obsolete inventory of the 97 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 62 million related to semiconductor test systems 30 million related to assembly test systems and 05 million related to other test systems 

  

during the year ended december 31 2003 teradyne recorded inventory provisions of 150 million in cost of which 58 million was for excess inventory and 92 million was for obsolete inventory of the 150 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 93 million related to assembly test systems which included 36 million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing distributing and primary support of the aoi product line 52 million related to semiconductor test systems soc parts and components and 05 million related to other test systems 

  

during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 teradyne sold inventory that was previously reserved which had a favorable gross margin impact of 15 million 13 million and 53 million respectively 

  

teradyne scrapped 343 million 421 million and 246 million of inventory which had been previously writtendown or writtenoff during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory 

  

as of december 31 2005 and 2004 teradyne had inventory reserves for amounts which have been writtendown or writtenoff of 1584 million and 1449 million respectively of the reserves at december 31 2005 489 million 70 million 100 million and 925 million relate to inventory provisions recorded in 2005 2004 2003 and prior to 2003 respectively 

  

engineering and development 

  

   

during 2005 teradyne reduced its levels of investment in engineering and development spending more than 85 of teradyne’s total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test systems segment where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between 150 and 250 million during 2005 semiconductor test systems completed its ultraflex platform development and shifted its focus to increasing the instrumentation set on its flex test platform ultraflex and flex which requires lower levels of engineering and development expenditures during 2003 and 2004 semiconductor test systems reduced the number of platforms under major development which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms the consolidation of multiple product divisions within semiconductor test systems into one group in 2001 enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation 

  

the decrease of 27 million in engineering and development spending from 2004 to 2005 consists of the following amounts 

  

     

the increase of 6 million in engineering and development spending from 2003 to 2004 consisted of the following amounts 

  

     

these increases were offset in part by the following 

  

    

selling and administrative 

  

   

the decrease in selling and administrative spending of 16 million from 2004 to 2005 is due primarily to an 87 million decrease in variable compensation offset by a 55 million increase in sales support spending for the flex platform and a 16 million increase in salaries and fringe benefits due to salary increases 

  

the increase in spending of 164 million from 2003 to 2004 was principally due to the following approximate amounts 

  

     

these increases were offset in part by the following 

  

    

restructuring and other charges 

  

in response to a downturn in the industry teradyne initiated restructuring activities in 2002 across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations further actions were initiated in 2003 to a lesser extent in 2004 and in 2005 the tables below represent activity related to these actions the remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employee compensation and withholdings the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other longterm accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2012 teradyne expects to pay out approximately 50 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months teradyne’s future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of 107 million as of december 31 2005 teradyne has subleased approximately 48 of its unoccupied space as of december 31 2005 and is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space 

  

2005 activities 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2005 teradyne recorded the following activity related to the 2005 restructuring activities 

  

       

2004 activities 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2004 and subsequently teradyne recorded the following activity related to the 2004 restructuring activities 

  

     

2003 activities 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2003 and subsequently teradyne recorded the following related to the 2003 restructuring activities 

  

    

   

pre2003 activities 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2003 and subsequently teradyne recorded the following related to restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003 

  

    

interest income and expense 

  

   

the increase in interest income from 2004 to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates 

  

the increase in interest income from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to an increase in interest rates in the latter half of 2004 and increased cash balances throughout 2004 

  

the decrease in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to the repurchase of 20 million and 715 million of teradyne’s 375 senior convertible notes the “notes” in the first and fourth quarters of 2005 respectively 

  

the decrease in interest expense from 2003 to 2004 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of teradyne’s california mortgage of 423 million in the third quarter of 2003 which reduced interest expense for 

  

the fourth quarter of 2003 and all of 2004 as well as the repurchase of 85 million of the notes in the third quarter of 2004 

  

other income and expense net 

  

other income and expense net for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 includes the following 

  

   

   

   

   

loss income from continuing operations before income taxes 

  

   

the change to a loss position from 2004 to 2005 was mainly attributable to decreased sales in the semiconductor test systems segment the change to an income position from a loss position from 2003 to 2004 was mainly attributable to increased sales in the semiconductor test systems segment as well as continued cost reductions throughout teradyne 

  

income taxes 

  

during 2005 the income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled 197 million under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” a benefit of 292 million was recognized for losses related to current year continuing operations as a result of the sale of connection systems there was an equal and offsetting tax provision in the gain on sale of connection systems included in discontinued operations the remaining portion of the net tax benefit includes a tax provision of 95 million that related primarily to foreign taxes 

  

for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes tax expense for 2004 also included an irs settlement related to the closing out of tax years 1999 through 2001 during 2004 teradyne utilized previously reserved net operating losses to reduce taxable income 

  

and lower the effective tax rate teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in 2003 until sufficient positive evidence exists including an appropriate level of profitability teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations due to the continued uncertainty of realization teradyne maintained its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december 31 2005 and 2004 teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists including sustained profitability that realization is more likely than not as of december 31 2005 teradyne had 6178 million of us federal operating loss carryforwards the effective tax rates from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were 246 141 and 42 respectively 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table reflects teradyne’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 

  

   

     

liquidity and capital resources 

  

teradyne’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased 2365 million in 2005 from 2004 to 9277 million and increased 1052 million in 2004 from 2003 to 6912 million cash activity for 2005 2004 and 2003 was as follows in millions 

  

   

changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired used cash of 538 million in 2005 as accounts receivable balances increased 630 million primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues from 55 days in 2004 to 61 days in 2005 and accounts payable deferred revenue and accruals decreased by 544 million which includes contributions to teradyne’s us qualified pension plan of approximately 350 million the uses of cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by a decrease of 705 million in inventory changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of 237 million in 2004 primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable deferred revenue and accrual balances of 375 million 

  

investing activities consist of purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities proceeds from the sale of businesses proceeds from asset disposals proceeds from the sale of product lines cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets capital expenditures were 1135 million in 2005 1546 million in 2004 and 690 million in 2003 capital expenditures decreased by 411 million in 2005 compared to 2004 additions of internally constructed systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in the semiconductor test systems segment accounted for approximately 202 million of the decrease in capital expenditures additions of internally constructed systems peaked in 2004 due to the introduction of the flex test platform the remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across teradyne capital expenditures increased by 855 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to additions of internally constructed systems to support the introduction of the flex test platform and to a lesser extent due to purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment to support the increase in revenues in 2004 and continued investment in research and development investing activities of the discontinued operation provided 3664 million of cash in 2005 in november of 2005 teradyne sold connection systems to amphenol corporation for net proceeds of 3827 million 

  

financing activities include sales of teradyne’s common stock as well as repayments of debt during 2005 2004 and 2003 repayments of longterm debt used cash of 987 million 115 million and 434 million 

  

respectively as teradyne repurchased a portion of its outstanding notes in the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and the third quarter of 2004 and prepaid its mortgage on its california properties in the third quarter of 2003 during 2005 2004 and 2003 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated 347 million 303 million and 1005 million respectively 

  

on october 24 2001 teradyne issued 400 million principal amount of the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of 389 million the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2600 per share which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 384615 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes teradyne began making annual interest payments of 15 million paid semiannually on the notes commencing on april 15 2002 the notes are senior unsecured obligations of teradyne that rank equally with teradyne’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness in the event of a change in control by which teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party the holders of the notes may be able to require teradyne to redeem some or all of the notes either in discounted teradyne common stock or in cash on february 8 2002 the commission declared effective a registration statement on form s3 covering both the notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted 

  

on or after october 18 2004 teradyne may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below the redemption price expressed as a percentage of principal amount is as follows for the designated periods 

  

   

thereafter teradyne may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount on august 18 2004 the board of directors of teradyne authorized management to repurchase up to 100 million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 10150 of the principal amount the board subsequently amended its authorization on october 21 2005 to authorize repurchases through open market purchases privately negotiated transaction auctions by redemption pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture or other means as determined by teradyne’s ceo or cfo at prices below 10075 of the principal amount the 100 million authorization for repurchase was fully utilized by management during the third quarter of 2004 and the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to repurchase 85 million 200 million and 715 million of the notes respectively the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the return teradyne would earn on high grade investment securities as a result of the repurchases teradyne’s interest payments for the notes in 2006 are expected to be 113 million on january 26 2006 management was given further authorization by the board of directors to repurchase up to the full 300 million of the principal amount that remains outstanding under the notes through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon pursuant to the new board resolutions on february 16 2006 teradyne repurchased 15 million of the notes as of february 22 2006 285 million of the principal amount of the notes remain outstanding there are a number of factors that will affect the timing of when and the amount of the notes that management may elect to repurchase including the price of the available notes teradyne’s available cash and marketable securities prevailing interest rates and teradyne’s anticipated liquidity needs 

  

if at some point in the future teradyne’s stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately 2600 per share management may elect to convert a portion of the notes into equity to avoid the continuation of interest payments and to conserve capital however there can be no assurance that even if teradyne’s stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the notes will convert into equity as teradyne’s stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date if this were to occur teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the notes called into cash there are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including teradyne’s stock price teradyne’s available cash and marketable securities and teradyne’s anticipated liquidity needs 

  

teradyne believes its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of 9277 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months teradyne plans to contribute approximately 200 million in 2006 to teradyne’s us qualified pension plan which is currently underfunded inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

  

retirement plans 

  

teradyne’s pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 157 million for the year ended december 31 2005 which was 13 of teradyne’s cost of revenue and operating expenses the largest portion of teradyne’s 2005 pension expense was 80 million for its us qualified pension plan including a curtailment charge of 17 million related to the sale of connection systems which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected return on plan assets for teradyne’s us qualified pension plan assets of 75 in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations teradyne also considered its historical 15year compounded return of 830 for the period ending december 31 2005 which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices based on these historical returns teradyne believes that 75 was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2005 teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust these returns as necessary 

  

the current asset allocation for teradyne’s us qualified pension plan is 484 invested in equity securities and 516 invested in fixed income securities which is in accordance with the plan’s asset allocation requirements teradyne’s actual asset allocation as of december 31 2005 was virtually identical to its asset allocation model teradyne’s investment manager regularly reviews teradyne’s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with teradyne’s targeted allocations 

  

teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2005 under the us qualified pension plan teradyne had cumulative gains of approximately 04 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index formerly salomon brothers pension liability index which was at 555 at december 31 2005 down from 568 at december 31 2004 as a result teradyne selected 550 for its december 31 2005 discount rate which was down from 575 as of december 31 2004 each year teradyne considers the citigroup pension liability index along with other indices including the moody’s aa rated corporate bond yield and the citigroup 10 year aaaaa rate the duration of the portfolio of pension liabilities is approximately 165 years which matches the duration of the citigroup pension liability index teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the us qualified pension plan will be approximately 52 million 43 million and 32 million in fiscal 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively the pension expense estimates are based on a 55 discount rate future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in teradyne’s pension plans 

  

teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended december 31 2005 if teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 

  

   

teradyne’s funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible the assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities the value of teradyne’s us qualified pension plan assets has increased from 1659 million at december 31 2004 to 2082 million at december 31 2005 teradyne contributions and investment performance returns have decreased the deficit of teradyne’s us qualified pension plan net of benefit obligations from 379 million at december 31 2004 to 202 million at december 31 2005 during 2005 teradyne contributed 35 million to the us qualified pension plan teradyne plans to contribute approximately 200 million in 2006 to this plan 

  

equity compensation plans 

  

in addition to teradyne’s 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in “note o stock based compensation” teradyne maintains three equity compensation plans under which its equity securities are authorized for issuance to teradyne’s employees directors andor consultants the three plans are 

  

1991 employee stock option plan 

  

1997 employee stock option plan and 

  

1996 nonemployee director stock option plan 

  

the purpose of these plans is to promote the interests of teradyne by attracting and retaining the services of qualified and talented persons to serve as employees directors andor consultants of teradyne except for the 1997 employee stock option plan each of the foregoing plans was approved by teradyne’s shareholders

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s tableend   

concentration of credit risk 

  

financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments forward currency contracts and accounts receivable teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities rated aa or higher 

  

which have minimal credit risk teradyne places forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 

  

exchange rate risk management 

  

teradyne regularly enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the european euro great britain pound japanese yen and the taiwan dollar these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year these contracts are used to reduce teradyne’s risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures in addition we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income teradyne does not engage in currency speculation 

  

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2005 and 2004 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk management 

  

teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates investments with interest rate risk include short and longterm marketable securities debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages 

  

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10 fluctuation in interest rates was assumed since the notes were “outof themoney” at december 31 2005 they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio on these bases the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is 13 million and 09 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively

semiconductor test systems 

  

teradyne produces semiconductor test systems which test a wide variety of “system on a chip” “soc” semiconductor devices during the manufacturing process these devices contain integrated analog digital and memory functions which allow an entire system or subsystem to reside on a single device or “chip” these chips are used in automotive communications consumer computer and electronic game applications among others semiconductor test systems are sold to integrated device manufacturers “idms” fabless companies and to foundries and subcontractors “subcons” subcons provide test and assembly services for the final packaged devices to both fabless companies and idms fabless companies perform the design of integrated circuits without manufacturing capabilities and use foundries for wafer manufacturing and subcons for test and assembly these customers obtain the overall benefit of comprehensively testing advanced performance devices while reducing their total costs associated with testing by using teradyne’s semiconductor test systems to 

  

      

the systems work in both wafer probe test and final package test applications 

  

soc devices span a huge range of functionality from very simple lowcost devices such as operational amplifiers or voltage regulators to complex digital signal processors and microprocessors teradyne offers a suite of test solutions to cover this range in the most economical way for each segment the main test equipment products are described below 

  

the j750 test system is designed to address the highest volume semiconductor devices devices such as microcontrollers are at the heart of almost every consumer electronics product from small appliances to automotive engine controllers these devices are produced in enormous quantities the lowest cost of test at very high production throughput rates is essential to meeting the economic requirements in these markets teradyne’s j750 test systems combine compact packaging high throughput and ease of production test these benefits are possible due to the high level of integration in the design a single circuit board in the j750 test system provides up to 64 digital inputoutput channels this innovative approach eliminated the traditional “mainframe” creating a “tester in the test head” or “zero footprint design” this approach allows the test system to be placed directly on top of a wafer prober without the need for any floor space for the tester itself the j750 has been met with success in the marketplace and has an installed base of over 1900 systems the j750 platform technology also has been used to create teradyne’s ip750 image sensor test system the ip750 is focused on testing image sensor devices used in digital cameras and other imaging products 

  

the catalyst ™ and catalysttiger test systems are designed to test a broad range of higher performance soc devices the catalyst is designed to test devices requiring data rates up to 400 mega bits per second “bps” with a broad range of analog performance over 1400 catalyst systems are in use today at idms and subcons testing integrated circuits for dvd players wireless cellular phones networking appliances telecommunications systems computer peripherals and many other applications

assembly test systems 

  

the functionality of nearly every electronic product is generated by one or more printed circuit boards pcbs each of which contain complex components cell phones and laptop computers contain singleboard assemblies while more complex internet switches and military avionics systems usually comprise multiboard assemblies as more and more functionality is packed into these systems the manufacturing and assembly processes become more complex this intensifies the need for fast accurate and reliable test and inspection systems teradyne’s pcb assembly test equipment is commonly used in the production process to maintain high yields ensure product quality diagnose faults and reduce manufacturing cost the company’s functional test equipment is used to verify proper operation of both single and multiboard assemblies at the end of the manufacturing cycle and later in the maintenance and repair cycle the teradyne assembly test product range includes the following 

  

incircuit test systems 

  

incircuit test systems examine the assembled and soldered printed circuit board for proper construction under both poweroff and poweron conditions defective components and solder joints are identified quickly and precisely fast lowcost fault identification and accurate diagnostic capabilities are valued features of teradyne’s incircuit testers which cause them to be used by global electronics manufacturers teradyne’s incircuit products support a full range of pcb test applications including highvolume production selective or sample test prototype testing and final or system test accordingly teradyne offers a variety of features and 

  

options with its teststation ™ and spectrum 8000series products the most recent option added to teradyne’s teststation family is the safetest ™ product this technology allows users to test the new lowvoltage components commonly found on low power pcbs for portable systems and battery operated instrumentation safetest ™ has helped improve the company’s market share of testers sold to manufacturers of consumer and commercial goods 

  

imaging inspection systems 

  

as circuit boards grow more complex achieving the electrical contact that traditional incircuit testers require is more difficult timeconsuming and expensive the “loss of electrical and visual access” and the move to leadfree manufacturing are contributing to the demand for advanced xray imaging inspection systems teradyne’s automated xray inspection axi systems are used to examine pcbs for manufacturing defects solder integrity problems are the most common however these new systems can automatically detect improper component placement and orientation electrical opens and shorts and a host of other board quality issues teradyne’s xstation products are the most widely used test platforms among major automotive manufacturers worldwide

sales and distribution 

  

prices for teradyne’s systems can reach 3 million or more in 2004 2003 and 2002 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of teradyne’s consolidated net revenue in each of the years 2004 2003 and 2002 teradyne’s three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 18 21 and 23 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

  

direct sales to united states government agencies accounted for less than 2 of consolidated net revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 approximately 23 12 and 10 of assembly test systems revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively was to united states government agencies and 24 28 and 15 of assembly test systems revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively was to customers who are government contractors 

  

teradyne has sales and service offices located throughout north america asia and europe as teradyne’s customers outside the united states are located primarily in these geographic areas teradyne sells in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force although teradyne conducts some manufacturing activities outside the us as detailed in item 2—properties teradyne’s manufacturing activities are primarily conducted in the united states 

  

sales to customers outside the united states accounted for 70 of consolidated net revenue in 2004 63 in 2003 and 54 in 2002 sales to customers located in singapore were 13 11 and 8 of consolidated net revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively sales to customers located in taiwan were 15 9 and 9 of consolidated net revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site 

  

teradyne is subject to the inherent risks involved in international trade such as 

  

          

teradyne attempts to reduce the effects of currency fluctuations by hedging those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and by conducting the majority of its international transactions in us dollars or dollar equivalents see also “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks” and “note f financial instruments” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

competition 

  

teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its reportable segments these competitors include among others advantest corporation agilent technologies inc credence systems corporation and ltx corporation some of teradyne’s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers some of teradyne’s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those teradyne currently offers teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of teradyne’s products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified pricebased competition which could materially adversely affect teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

backlog 

  

at december 31 2004 and 2003 teradyne’s backlog of unfilled orders in each of its four reportable segments was as follows 

  

   

of the backlog at december 31 2004 approximately 96 of the semiconductor test systems backlog 100 of the connection systems backlog 100 of assembly test systems backlog and 93 of the other test systems backlog is expected to be delivered in 2005 generally teradyne’s backlog policy requires delivery of products and services within twelve months 

  

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders teradyne’s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

raw materials 

  

teradyne’s products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers certain of these components are standard products while others are manufactured to teradyne’s specifications teradyne can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items while the majority of teradyne’s components are available from multiple suppliers certain items are obtained from sole sources teradyne could experience a temporary adverse impact if any of its sole source suppliers ceased to deliver products any prolonged inability to obtain adequate supplies or any other circumstances that would require teradyne to seek alternative sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

  

patents and licenses 

  

teradyne’s development of its products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information and technology teradyne protects its rights in proprietary information and technology through various methods such as 

  

         

however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit teradyne’s proprietary technology andor information in countries where teradyne lacks enforceable intellectual property rights “ip” or enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also ip protections can be invalidated through legal processes while teradyne does not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to its business if a significant portion of teradyne’s intellectual property or proprietary rights is invalidated or ineffective teradyne’s business could be materially adversely affected 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2004 teradyne employed approximately 6200 people since the inception of teradyne’s business there have been no work stoppages or other labor disturbances teradyne has no collective bargaining contracts 

  

engineering and development activities 

  

the highly technical nature of teradyne’s products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures were 2620 million in 2004 2546 million in 2003 and 2939 million in 2002 these expenditures amounted to approximately 15 of consolidated net revenue in 2004 19 in 2003 and 24 in 2002 

  

environmental affairs 

  

teradyne is subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment teradyne accrues for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that teradyne will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated the amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of investigation estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of teradyne’s operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

  

in 2001 teradyne was designated as a “potentially responsible party” “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arises out of teradyne’s acquisition of perception laminates inc in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july 30 1992 neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site teradyne has asked the state of california to drop the prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so management does not believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such outcome would not have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position or results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

after the august 2000 acquisition of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc the former owners of those companies filed a complaint on september 5 2001 against teradyne and two of its executive officers the case is now pending in federal district court in san diego california teradyne filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety on behalf of teradyne and the two individual defendants the court granted the motion in part and the only remaining claims were that the sale of our common stock to the former owners violated certain california securities statutes and common law and that we had breached certain contractual obligations in the agreements relating to the acquisitions our subsequent motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the breach of contract claims was granted on november 7 2002 on december 9 2002 the plaintiffs filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its summary judgment ruling or alternatively for certification under rule 54b which would grant the plaintiffs leave to appeal both the court’s ruling regarding dismissal of claims and its ruling granting summary judgment to the ninth circuit court of appeals we opposed these motions on april 22 2003 the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion from reconsideration and the plaintiffs’ request for certification under rule 54b the only claim remaining before the district court from the original complaint related to an allegation of fraud in connection with the setting of the transaction price we have answered and denied all liability on december 27 2004 plaintiffs voluntarily stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of its remaining claims in the trial court without having received any payment or other consideration from teradyne on february 2 2005 the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the court’s prior orders dismissing certain of the plaintiffs’ claims and granting partial summary judgment against them and denying the plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration 

  

in 2001 we were designated as a “potentially responsible party” “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arises out of teradyne’s acquisition of perception laminates inc in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july 30 1992 neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site we have asked the state of california to drop the prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so 

  

in august of 2003 hampshire equity partners ii lp “hep” informed teradyne of a potential claim that was subsequently contained in the complaint that hep filed on april 30 2004 against teradyne and teradyne’s connection systems segment “tcs” in the united states district court of the southern district of new york relating to its february 21 2001 investment of 55 million in connector service corporation aka amax plating inc “csc” which was a supplier to tcs at the time during the due diligence that hep conducted prior to making that investment an agent of hep spoke with tcs among other csc customers concerning csc on or about september 24 2003 csc filed for bankruptcy protection as discussed above hep has now brought suit against teradyne and tcs asserting fraud and negligence based claims and a claim for intentional interference with economic opportunity relating to statements that a tcs representative made to hep’s agent prior to hep’s february 2001 investment in csc hep seeks to hold teradyne and tcs responsible for its decision to invest in csc and for the losses that it suffered upon the bankruptcy of csc hep is now seeking damages for an unstated amount of not less than 55 million on june 17 2004 teradyne and tcs filed a motion to dismiss hep’s complaint in its entirety on august 9 2004 hep filed its opposition to the motion to dismiss and teradyne filed its reply brief on september 22 2004 teradyne’s motion to dismiss remains pending 

  

we believe that we have meritorious defenses against the above unsettled claims and intend to vigorously contest them while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of the unsettled claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise we believe the losses associated with all of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period 

  

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as but not limited to patent employment commercial and environmental matters although there can be no assurance there are no such matters pending that we expect to be material with respect to our business financial position or results of operations

materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forwardlooking statements factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in “certain factors that may affect future results” and elsewhere herein 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results 

  

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes pensions warranties contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in accordance with the guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to teradyne’s customers upon shipment in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur 

  

for equipment that includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment or in the case of new products revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received for multiple element arrangements teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of teradyne teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately teradyne’s postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customer’s ability to use the product teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and teradyne defers revenue in accordance with fasb technical bulletin 901 teradyne’s products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

  

connection systems revenue is generally recognized upon shipment according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements 

  

teradyne does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products 

  

for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement of position no 972 “sop 972” “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop no 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” exists for such elements in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

  

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

  

inventories 

  

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

  

stock option and stock purchase plans 

  

teradyne accounts for its director and employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” and related interpretations teradyne’s employee stock purchase plan is a noncompensatory plan teradyne’s stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb 25 accordingly there have been no charges for employee or director stock options or employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paidin capital 

  

teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under statement of financial accounting standard no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “fas 123” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stock based compensation – transition and disclosure” see “note b accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” in interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 sfas 123r would eliminate the ability to 

  

account for equitybased compensation using the intrinsic valuebased method under apb 25 sfas 123r requires companies’ to calculate equitybased compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant under sfas 123r equitybased compensation is required to be recognized in companies’ financial statements teradyne expects to adopt sfas 123r in the third quarter of 2005 as required for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 had sfas 123r been effective teradyne would have recognized additional noncash equitybased compensation expense of 918 million 851 million and 1103 million respectively applying the provisions of sfas 123

on a quarterly basis teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance as a result of its review undertaken at december 31 2002 teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance due to the continued uncertainty of realization teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at december 31 2003 and 2004 teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence including sustained profitability exists that realization is more likely than not 

  

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

  

teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of teradyne’s use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

  

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest the volatility of the industries that teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows which can impact their ability to make required payments teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customer’s current payment history the customer’s current financial statements and other information regarding the customer’s credit worthiness if the financial condition of teradyne’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered

bookings 

  

teradyne’s net orders for its four reportable segments for 2004 2003 and 2002 are as follows 

  

   

from 2003 to 2004 semiconductor test systems bookings increased due to growth in the overall systemonachip “soc” tester market excluding memory testers semiconductor test systems bookings within the soc market showed a continuation of the growth in asian markets from 2003 into 2004 mainly related to subcons in taiwan and singapore over 2004 teradyne saw a rise in bookings driven primarily by semiconductor testing needs in the wireless broadband consumer electronics and mass storagedatacom markets which are serviced by the j750 catalyst and flex products and whose chips are sold mainly by european and us semiconductor companies many of these chips are fabricated and tested by foundries and 

  

subcons in many parts of asia but concentrated in taiwan and singapore the economic downturn which prevailed in past years has pushed companies to lower fixed costs as a result an increasing trend by chip makers has been to outsource noncore competency testing needs to subcons in low cost regions as total semiconductor test systems bookings have grown the bookings from subcons have continued to make up a large percentage of total orders bookings from subcons increased 45 to 443 million in 2004 from 307 million in 2003 and made up 43 of bookings in 2004 compared to 37 in 2003 semiconductor test systems backlog increased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to increased orders from subcons and foundries located in the asian markets 

  

the growth in connection systems orders from 2003 to 2004 was a result of continued spending for wireless network deployments in the united states and europe as well as an increase in network spending for both the enterprise and service provider markets the computerserver market was also strong bookings were up appreciably for connection systems’ vhdmhsd backplane interconnect product lines as well as the nexlev family of highspeed highdensity mezzanine connectors similar to 2003 the growth in orders was partially offset by a decline in orders due to the decision to exit a portion of connection systems’ lower margin ems product line the increase in connection systems bookings from 2002 to 2003 was due in part to a decrease in cancellations in 2003 as well as an increase in demand in the telecommunications market driven by wireless network deployments which increased for both us and european telecommunications equipment providers in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the first half of 2003 

  

orders in the assembly test systems segment increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily driven by increases in the milaero business and increased sales of incircuit products the growth in these areas was offset by a decline in orders resulting from the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual xray and rework product lines in 2003 the net decrease in assembly test systems orders from 2002 to 2003 is due primarily to the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual xray and rework product lines this decrease was offset by a 25 increase in orders by government agencies and contractors in the milaero business which had a twofold increase in orders from the first half to the second half of 2003 

  

teradyne’s cancellations for its four reportable segments for the last three years are as follows 

  

   

semiconductor test systems experienced 105 million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in 2004 approximately 50 of this amount was related to cancellations while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to management’s estimate of what may be canceled in future periods 

  

the connection systems cancellations in 2003 were from major customers in the telecommunications and networking infrastructure industries due principally to product program cancellations 

  

teradyne’s net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows 

  

   

for the past three years teradyne’s backlog of unfilled orders for its four reportable segments is as follows 

  

   

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties in 2004 2003 and 2002 there were no significant cancellation penalties received due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders teradyne’s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue 

  

teradyne’s net revenue for its four reportable segments for 2004 2003 and 2002 is as follows 

  

   

the increase in semiconductor test systems sales from 2003 to 2004 is attributable to growth in the overall soc test market and a share gain by semiconductor test systems in that market the worldwide market for semiconductor test equipment excluding memory testers grew by approximately 34 in 2004 semiconductor test system’s share in that market grew from 2003 to 2004 much of the increased sales for semiconductor test systems came from subcon customers for use in their asian facilities primarily in singapore and taiwan the revenue derived from subcons was driven by higher demand from their mixed signal soc customers led by sales of catalyst and flex systems as is described in the bookings section semiconductor test systems has seen growth in revenue from 2003 to 2004 due to increased need for testing in the wireless broadband and to a lesser extent mass storagedatacom sectors sales of the j750 product were also relatively strong in 2004 serving the microcontroller and high volume logic customer segments similar to the increase in sales from 2003 to 2004 the increase from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to increased demand from subcons located in the asian markets particularly singapore taiwan and malaysia 

  

connection systems sales in 2004 increased to 3817 million led by stronger customer demand for connection systems’ highspeed highdensity interconnect products which more than offset the decrease in sales associated with the exiting of the lower margin ems business in 2003 connection systems sales declined from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the decision to exit the lower margin ems business the segment saw downward pricing pressure throughout the past three years 

  

the increase in assembly test systems sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to increases in both the commercial and milaero businesses commercial business growth was due to increased sales of in circuit test products while the increase in milaero sales was generated by a number of large projects which were undertaken in 2004 these increases were offset in part by decreases from the sale of the manual xray rework and aoi product lines in 2003 from 2002 through 2003 the commercial business saw decreases in revenue particularly due to the sale of product lines referenced above while milaero revenue increased slightly year over year  

  

teradyne’s four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years 

  

   

teradyne’s net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows 

  

   

teradyne’s product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows 

  

   

service revenue is derived from the servicing of teradyne’s installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support 

  

in the past three years no single customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 teradyne’s three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 18 21 and 23 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

  

gross margin 

  

   

the gross margin improvement from 2003 to 2004 was the result of several factors an improvement of 9 points is credited to an increase in sales volumes and a shift in the mix of revenues with higher semiconductor test systems content which has higher incremental margins the remainder is attributable to lower material costs and a reduction in fixed manufacturing costs including depreciation and facility costs resulting from past restructuring actions 

  

teradyne’s gross margin improvement from 2002 to 2003 was impacted by a variety of factors including an improvement of 49 points related to reduced manufacturing costs and increased volume levels and an improvement of 25 points related to an increase in volume and a shift in product mix inventory provisions decreased from 390 million in 2002 to 166 million in 2003 which contributed a 20 point gross margin improvement 

  

the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows 

  

   

teradyne assesses the carrying value of its inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed is writtendown to estimated net realizable value these writeoffs and writedowns consist of raw materials and components sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision which is recorded in cost of revenues 

  

during the year ended december 31 2004 teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of 35 million and 78 million respectively of the 113 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 62 million related to semiconductor test systems 30 million related to assembly test systems 16 million related to connection systems and 05 million related to other test systems 

  

during the year ended december 31 2003 teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of 74 million and 92 million respectively of the 166 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 93 million related to assembly test systems which included 36 million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing distributing and primary support of the aoi product line and 52 million related to semiconductor test systems soc parts and components 

  

during the year ended december 31 2002 teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of 281 million and 109 million respectively of the 390 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded 279 million related to semiconductor test systems including 207 million of memory test inventory related to probeone and j996 product line discontinuances the probeone and j996 inventory had been fully writtenoff as of december 31 2003 there is no material exposure remaining for the probeone or j996 products 

  

during the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 teradyne sold inventory that was previously reserved for which had a gross margin impact of 22 million and 53 million respectively 

  

teradyne scrapped 448 million 303 million and 228 million of inventory which had been previously writtendown or writtenoff during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory 

  

as of december 31 2004 and 2003 teradyne had inventory reserves for amounts which have been writtendown or writtenoff of 1539 million and 1911 million respectively of the reserves at december 31 2004 105 million 126 million 36 million and 1272 million relate to inventory provisions recorded in 2004 2003 2002 and prior to 2002 respectively of the reserves at december 31 2003 166 million 202 million and 1543 million related to inventory provisions recorded in 2003 2002 and prior to 2002 respectively 

  

engineering and development 

  

   

during 2004 teradyne maintained its commitment to sustained levels of investment in research through continued engineering and development spending more than twothirds of teradyne’s total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test systems segment where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between 150250 million during 2002 and 2003 semiconductor test systems reduced the number of platforms under major development which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms the consolidation of multiple product divisions within semiconductor test systems into one group has enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation 

  

the increase of 7 million in engineering and development spending from 2003 to 2004 consists of the following amounts 

  

      

these increases were offset in part by the following 

  

   

   

the reduction in engineering and development expenses from 2002 to 2003 resulted primarily from the exiting of product lines within semiconductor test systems and assembly test systems the elimination of memory test within the semiconductor test systems segment resulted in a reduction of 5 million in engineering expenses from 2002 to 2003 in addition semiconductor test systems consolidated engineering facilities outsourced certain software engineering development to a lowcost region and limited the amount of engineering work done by outside consultants in an effort to reduce costs as a result of the sale in assembly test systems of its manufacturing software product line and manual xray inspection and rework product line as well as the discontinuance of the automated optical inspection products engineering expenses from 2002 to 2003 decreased by approximately 15 million 

  

the decrease from 2002 to 2003 in engineering and development spending resulting from the discontinuance of product lines and actions taken to reduce costs consists of the following amounts 

  

      

selling and administrative 

  

   

the increase in spending of 19 million from 2003 to 2004 was principally due to the following approximate amounts 

  

     

these increases were offset in part by the following 

  

    

the decrease in spending from 2002 to 2003 was principally due to the following approximate amounts 

  

      

restructuring and other charges 

  

the tables below represent activity related to restructuring charges for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 the accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings the accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other longterm accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2012 teradyne expects to pay out approximately 70 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months teradyne’s future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of 13 million as of december 31 2004 teradyne has subleased approximately 52 of its unoccupied space as of december 31 2004 and is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space 

  

the table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended december 31 2004 relating to restructuring and other charges in thousands 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2004 teradyne recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges 

  

      

the restructuring actions taken in 2004 are expected to generate cost savings of approximately 138 million million annually across all areas of operations 

  

during 2004 teradyne recorded a gain on the sale of a business of 09 million this amount related to an earnout provision from a divestiture in the connection systems segment in 1999 and has been classified as a gain on the sale of business in the statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

the table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended december 31 2003 relating to restructuring and other charges 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2003 teradyne recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges 

  

       

the restructuring actions taken in 2003 were expected to generate cost savings of approximately 863 million annually across all areas of operations 

  

the table below summarizes activity for the year ended december 31 2002 relating to restructuring and other charges 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2002 teradyne recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges 

  

     

for further details on teradyne’s restructuring and other charges during 2004 2003 and 2002 see “note l restructuring and other charges” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2005 teradyne committed to a restructuring plan “the plan” as part of an ongoing effort to lower expenses pursuant to the plan teradyne believes that it will incur costs for severance and related employee benefits impairment charges and remaining lease obligations related to a vacated facility and other charges the total charges expected to be incurred under the plan are 110 million the actions taken in accordance with the plan are expected to generate cost savings of approximately 184 million annually primarily in the connection systems and assembly test segments through march 11 2005 teradyne has incurred charges of approximately 82 million related to severance and related employee benefits remaining lease obligations and related asset impairments and other charges 

  

goodwill impairment 

  

unless conditions dictate otherwise teradyne’s annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year teradyne tested the assembly test systems and connection systems reporting units for impairment during its annual test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in either reporting unit as of december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

during the quarter ended september 28 2003 teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue bookings and profit for the fiscal years 2004 through 2006 from the previous quarter’s forecast for the assembly test systems segment and reduced its workforce by 112 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook as a result teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the assembly test systems segment as of september 28 2003 teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the assembly test systems segment did not exceed its fair value and thus no impairment charge was recorded the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 

  

during the quarter ended september 29 2002 as a result of contraction in the assembly test systems market to its lowest level in a decade as evidenced by various market reports available to teradyne teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue bookings and profit for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 from the previous quarter’s forecast for the assembly test systems segment and reduced its workforce by 94 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook as a result teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the assembly test systems segment as of september 29 2002 teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the assembly test systems segment exceeded its fair value and recognized a 785 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations the impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the assembly test systems segment to its carrying value the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 

  

interest income and expense 

  

   

the increase in interest income from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to an increase in interest rates in the latter half of 2004 and increased cash balances throughout 2004 the decrease in interest income from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates 

  

the decrease in interest expense from 2003 to 2004 and from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of teradyne’s california mortgage of 423 million in the third quarter of 2003 which reduced interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2003 and all of 2004 as well as the repurchase of 85 million of teradyne’s 375 convertible notes in the third quarter of 2004 

  

other income and expense net 

  

other income and expense net for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 includes the following 

  

   

   

   

   

income loss before income taxes 

  

   

the change to an income position from a loss position from 2003 to 2004 was mainly attributable to increased sales in the semiconductor connector and assembly test systems segments as well as continued cost reductions throughout the company 

  

the decrease in the loss before income taxes from 2002 to 2003 in semiconductor test systems connection systems and assembly test systems was primarily due to cost reduction actions in the respective segments and market conditions during the year other test systems income before income taxes increased primarily due to increased revenues from 2002 to 2003 

  

income taxes 

  

for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes tax expense for 2004 also included an irs settlement related to the closing out of tax years 1999 through 2001 during 2004 teradyne utilized previously reserved net operating losses to reduce taxable income and lower the effective tax rate teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in 2003 until sufficient positive evidence exists including an appropriate level of profitability teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations due to the continued uncertainty of realization teradyne maintained its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december 31 2004 and 2003 teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence including sustained profitability exists that realization is more likely than not the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 were 121 and 42 respectively 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 teradyne recorded a tax provision of 1575 million resulting in a tax rate of 28 the tax rate of 28 is primarily due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2002 teradyne recorded a tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable the evidence that teradyne reviewed during the fourth quarter of 2002 included actual revenues and net loss for the fiscal year 2002 compared to earlier teradyne forecasts the inability to get to breakeven during 2002 despite implementing several restructuring programs and a reduction in revenues and an increase in the loss forecasted for the fiscal year 2003 as a result of its review undertaken at december 31 2002 teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table reflects teradyne’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 

  

   

     

liquidity and capital resources 

  

teradyne’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased 1052 million in 2004 from 2003 to 6912 million teradyne’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased 449 million in 2003 from 2002 to 5860 million and increased 451 million in 2002 from 2001 to 5411 million cash activity for 2004 2003 and 2002 was as follows in millions 

  

   

changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired used cash of 449 million in 2004 as inventory balances increased 160 million across each of teradyne’s segments although primarily in the semiconductor test systems segment and accounts payable deferred revenue and accruals decreased by 423 million which includes a contribution to teradyne’s us qualified pension plan of approximately 356 million the inventory accounts payable deferred revenue and accrual balances were partially offset by a decrease of 60 million in the accounts receivable balances primarily due to an decrease in days sales outstanding based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues from 59 days in 2003 to 54 days in 2004 changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of 189 million in 2003 primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances of 563 million across all segments changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of 2031 million in 2002 primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances across all segments and the receipt of a tax refund in march of 2002 

  

investing activities consist of purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities proceeds from the sale of businesses proceeds from asset disposals proceeds from the sale of product lines cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets capital expenditures increased by 841 million in 2004 compared to 2003 additions of internally constructed systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in the semiconductor test systems segment accounted for approximately 692 million of the increase in capital expenditures due to the recent introduction of the flex platform the remainder of the increase was attributable to purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across teradyne to support the increase in revenues in 2004 and continued investment in research and development capital expenditures were 1652 million in 2004 812 million in 2003 and 764 million in 2002 

  

financing activities include sales of teradyne’s common stock as well as repayments of debt during 2004 and 2003 repayments of longterm debt used cash of 115 million and 434 million respectively as teradyne repurchased a portion of its outstanding 375 convertible senior notes in the third quarter of 2004 and prepaid its mortgage on its california properties in the third quarter of 2003 during 2004 2003 and 2002 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated 303 million 1005 million and 412 million respectively 

  

on october 24 2001 teradyne issued 400 million principal amount of 375 convertible senior notes due 2006 the “notes” in a private placement and received net proceeds of 389 million the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2600 per share which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 384615 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes teradyne began making annual interest payments of 15 million paid semiannually on the notes commencing on april 15 2002 the notes are senior unsecured obligations of teradyne that rank equally with teradyne’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness in the event of a change in control by which teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party the holders of the notes may be able to require teradyne to redeem some or all of the notes either in discounted teradyne common stock or in cash on february 8 2002 the securities and exchange commission declared effective a registration statement on form s3 covering both the notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted 

  

on or after october 18 2004 teradyne may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below the redemption price expressed as a percentage of principal amount is as follows for the designated periods 

  

   

and thereafter equal to 100 of the principal amount the board of directors of teradyne has authorized management to repurchase up to 100 million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 10150 in the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 teradyne repurchased 85 million and 200 million of the notes respectively the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the redemption price during the period currently management intends to repurchase the notes on the open market through negotiated transactions when management believes that such price is beneficial to teradyne there are a number of factors that will affect the timing of when and the amount of the notes that management may elect to repurchase including the price of the available notes teradyne’s stock price teradyne’s available cash and marketable securities prevailing interest rates and teradyne’s anticipated liquidity needs 

  

if at some point in the future teradyne’s stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately 2600 per share management may elect to convert a portion of the notes into equity to avoid the continuation of interest payments and to conserve capital however there can be no assurance that even if teradyne’s stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the notes will convert into equity as teradyne’s stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date if this were to occur teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the notes called into cash there are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including teradyne’s stock price teradyne’s available cash and marketable securities and teradyne’s anticipated liquidity needs 

  

teradyne believes its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of 6912 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months teradyne plans to contribute approximately 300 million in 2005 to teradyne’s us qualified pension plan which is currently underfunded inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

  

retirement plans 

  

teradyne’s pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 118 million for the year ended december 31 2004 which was 073 of teradyne’s cost of revenue and operating expenses the largest portion of teradyne’s 2004 pension expense was 57 million for its us qualified pension plan which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected return on plan assets for teradyne’s us qualified pension plan assets of 8 in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations teradyne also considered its historical 15year compounded return of 841 for the period ending december 31 2003 which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices based on these historical returns teradyne believes that 8 was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2004 teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust these returns as necessary 

  

the current asset allocation for teradyne’s us qualified pension plan is 481 invested in equity securities and 519 invested in fixed income securities which is in accordance with the plan’s asset allocation requirements teradyne’s actual asset allocation as of december 31 2004 was virtually identical to its asset allocation model teradyne’s investment manager regularly reviews teradyne’s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with teradyne’s targeted allocations 

  

teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2004 in the us qualified pension plan teradyne had cumulative losses of approximately 62 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index formerly salomon brothers pension liability index which was at 568 at december 31 2004 down from 600 at december 31 2003 as a result teradyne selected 575 for its december 31 2004 discount rate which was down from 6 as of december 31 2003 each year teradyne considers the citigroup pension liability index along with other indices including the moody’s aa rated corporate bond yield and the citigroup 10 year aaaaa rate teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the us qualified pension plan will be approximately 57 million 51 million and 47 million in fiscal 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively the pension expense estimates are based on a 575 discount rate future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in teradyne’s pension plans 

  

teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended december 31 2004 if teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 

  

   

teradyne’s funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible the assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities the value of teradyne’s us qualified pension plan assets has increased from 1216 million at december 31 2003 to 1659 million at december 31 2004 the investment performance returns and teradyne contributions have decreased the deficit of teradyne’s us qualified pension plan net of benefit obligations from 709 million at december 31 2003 to 379 million at december 31 2004 during 2004 teradyne contributed 356 million to the us qualified pension plan teradyne plans to contribute approximately 300 million in 2005 to this plan 

  

equity compensation plans 

  

in addition to teradyne’s 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in “note p stock based compensation” teradyne maintains three equity compensation plans under which its equity securities are authorized for issuance to teradyne’s employees directors andor consultants 

  

   

   

   

the purpose of these plans is to promote the interests of teradyne by attracting and retaining the services of qualified and talented persons to serve as employees directors andor consultants of teradyne except for the 1997 employee stock option plan each of the foregoing plans was approved by teradyne’s shareholders

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in march 2004 the fasb ratified emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” “eitf 031” but in september 2004 delayed the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf 031 for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2004 only the disclosure requirements for availableforsale securities and cost method investments are required 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” in interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 sfas 123r would eliminate the ability to account for equitybased compensation using the intrinsic valuebased method under apb 25 sfas 123r requires companies’ to calculate equitybased compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 

  

under sfas 123r public companies are allowed to select from three alternative transition methods the modified prospective application which allows for the adoption of sfas 123r without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption the modified prospective application with restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption and the modified retrospective application which allows companies to restate prior financial statements teradyne expects to adopt sfas 123r beginning in the third quarter of 2005 as required using the modified prospective method and will not restate prior periods for the adoption of sfas 123r  

  

currently teradyne discloses pro forma net income loss and related pro forma net income loss per share in accordance with sfas 123 and sfas 148 under sfas 123r equitybased compensation expense is required to be recognized in companies’ financial statements for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 had sfas 123r been effective teradyne would have recognized additional noncash equitybased compensation expense of 918 million 851 million and 1103 million respectively applying the provisions of sfas 123 teradyne is considering accelerating the vesting of certain outstanding unvested “out of the money” stock options awarded to employees officers and other eligible participants under teradyne’s various stock option plans in addition teradyne is considering the use of other equity compensation vehicles including the use of restricted stock 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” “sfas 151” sfas 151 modifies the accounting for abnormal inventory costs and the manner in which companies allocate fixed overhead expenses to inventory sfas 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 teradyne does not expect sfas 151 to have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations 

  

certain factors that may affect future results 

  

from time to time information we provide statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form 10k contain statements that are not purely historical but are forward looking statements made under section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 which involve risks and uncertainties in particular forward looking statements made herein include projections plans and objectives for our business financial condition operating results future operations or future economic performance statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital requirements capital expenditures expectations as to customer orders and demand for our products and statements relating to backlog bookings and cancellations gross margins and pricing considerations these statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties both known and unknown which could cause our actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements factors that may cause such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below these factors and others are discussed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 

  

our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles which are difficult to predict 

  

capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries such as teradyne have in the past been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies and resulting reductions in customer capital investments future slowdowns in global economies and reductions in customer capital investments which may adversely impact our business are difficult to predict 

  

acts of war terrorists attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact our business 

  

acts of war and terrorists attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees facilities customers suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as we sell and manufacture products both in the united states and internationally the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at those locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems all of these conditions make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics which historically have been highly cyclical 

  

our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns and the effects of hostile acts historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems we manufacture and market we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we cannot assure that the level of revenues or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

  

we have taken measures to address the slowdown in the market for our products which could have longterm negative effects on our business 

  

during 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 we took measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products in particular we reduced our workforce closed andor sold facilities discontinued certain product lines implemented material cost reduction programs and reduced planned capital expenditures and expense budgets each measure we took to address such slowdowns could have longterm negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in our products increasing our debt and making it more difficult to respond to customers or competitors as the market and customer orders turn around 

  

we may not be able to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 

  

because we took measures in recent years to scale back operations and reduce expenses in response to decreased customer demand for products and services we may not be able to satisfy a rapid increase in customer demand our ability to meet rapid increases in customer demand is also to a certain extent dependant upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to meet increased product or delivery requirements over which we have little or no control 

  

our business may be adversely impacted by acquisitions which may affect our ability to manage and maintain our business 

  

since our inception we have acquired a number of businesses in the future we may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement our existing operations such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks including 

  

           

for example in connection with the august 2000 acquisition of each of herco technology corp a california company and perception laminates inc a california company a complaint was filed on or about september 5 2001 and is now pending in federal district court san diego california by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of our executive officers this case is further described in “part i item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

  

additionally in 2001 we were designated as a “potentially responsible party” “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arises out of our acquisition of perception laminates inc in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july 30 1992 this matter is further described in “part i item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

  

we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

from time to time we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and in the event of an adverse decision pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

for example on april 30 2004 hampshire equity partners ii lp “hep” filed a complaint against teradyne and teradyne connection systems segment “tcs” asserting fraud and negligence based claims and a claim for intentional interference with economic opportunity in the complaint hep alleges that it relied upon statements made by a representative of tcs to a hep agent during its due diligence prior to investing 55 million in connector services corporation aka amax plating inc “csc” hep seeks to hold teradyne and tcs responsible for its decision to invest in csc and for the losses it has suffered upon the bankruptcy of csc hep seeks damages in an unstated amount exceeding 55 million the case is currently pending in the us district court of the southern district of new york we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend ourselves vigorously management does not believe that the outcomes of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations this case is further described in “part i item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

  

our business may be adversely impacted by divestitures of lines of business which may affect our ability to manage and maintain our business 

  

since our inception we have divested certain lines of business in the future we may undertake additional such divestitures such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks including 

  

       

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 

  

our products incorporate technology that we protect in several ways including patents copyrights trade secrets and by contract “ip” however even with these protections our ip may still be challenged invalidated or subject to other infringement actions while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate no single element of our ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective our business could be materially adversely affected in addition we receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or require a significant use of management resources and necessitate a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products our revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers in a rapidly evolving market such as ours the development of new technologies 

  

commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors including 

  

        

we are subject to intense competition 

  

we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to risks of operating internationally 

  

a significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the united states our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

  

          

in addition an increasingly large portion of our products are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result we are subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

  

our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 

  

competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements we could have reduced revenues and earnings 

  

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products we could lose timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control 

  

we are also dependent on the financial strength of our suppliers and may be subject to litigation arising from our relationships with suppliers and others there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 

  

we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes if we fail to comply with present and future regulations or are required to perform site remediation we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

  

     

pursuant to present regulations and agreements we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2004 we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

  

on january 27 2003 the european union adopted the following directives i the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” and ii the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the “weee directive” both the rohs directive and the weee directive will alter the type and manner in which electronic equipment is imported sold and handled in the european union ensuring compliance with the rohs directive and the weee directive and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus could have a negative impact on the business operations and financial condition the rohs directive and the weee directive will be become effective on july 6 2006 and august 13 2005 respectively 

  

we have substantially increased our indebtedness 

  

on october 24 2001 we completed a private placement of 400 million principal amount of 375 convertible senior notes the “notes” due october 15 2006 and received net proceeds of 389 million as a result we have incurred approximately 400 million principal amount of additional indebtedness substantially increasing our ratio of debt to total capitalization the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

  

   

       

during the year ended december 31 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005 teradyne took steps to reduce its indebtedness including repurchasing a total of 285 million of the notes on the open market pursuant to the board of directors authorization given to management to repurchase up to 100 million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 10150 there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations including our obligations under the notes 

  

we may not be able to satisfy certain obligations in the event of a change in control 

  

the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of teradyne if a “change in control” occurs the holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase all of the notes not previously called for redemption the price that we are required to pay is 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased together with interest accrued but unpaid to but excluding the repurchase date at our option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions instead of paying the repurchase price in cash we may pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at 95 of the average of the closing prices of common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date if we are required to repurchase the notes there is no guarantee that we will have enough funds to pay such amounts 

  

as a result a change in control could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 

  

if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of our other obligations we would be in default under the terms thereof which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial position and operating results in addition we cannot assure that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations moreover we cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 

  

we may need additional financing which could be difficult to obtain 

  

we expect that our existing cash and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months however we have a finite amount of cash and in the event we may need to raise additional funds due to losses or other reasons we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms if at all further if we issue additional equity securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock future financings may place restrictions on how we operate our business if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms if and when needed we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services take advantage of future opportunities grow our business or respond to competitive pressures which could seriously harm our business 

  

we will be required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense which will adversely affect our operating results 

  

there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options we currently disclose pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the grants’ fair value and disclosing the impact on net income loss and net income loss per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements sfas 123r or any other future laws and regulations requiring us to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations will adversely affect operating results note b “accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on net income loss and net income loss per share if it had been in effect during the year ended december 31 2004 included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” are additional stockbased compensation disclosures 

  

provisions of our charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

  

our basic corporate documents our stockholder rights plan and massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders 

  

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

  

our annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability 

  

the following factors set out below are expected to impact future operations 

  

          

in particular due to the introduction of a number of new complex test systems in 2003 and 2004 and the planned introduction of other systems in 2005 and beyond there can be no assurance that we will not experience delays in shipment of our products or that our products will achieve customer acceptance 

  

as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

  

we have significant guarantees and indemnification obligations 

  

from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products guarantee certain indebtedness obligations of our subsidiary companies and have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers directors employees and agents to the extent permitted by law arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer director employee or agent is or was serving at our request in such capacity if we become liable under any of these obligations it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results for additional information regarding “guarantees and indemnification obligations” see part i note j “commitments and contingencies” in this form 10k in addition to the guarantee and indemnification obligations set forth in this 10k teradyne occasionally guarantees the performance obligations and responsibilities of its subsidiary and affiliate companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks tableend   

concentration of credit risk 

  

financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments forward currency contracts and accounts receivable teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities rated aa or higher which have minimal credit risk teradyne places forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 

  

exchange rate risk management 

  

teradyne regularly enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in european and japanese currencies these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year these contracts are used to reduce teradyne’s risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures in addition we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income teradyne does not engage in currency speculation 

  

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk management 

  

teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates investments with interest rate risk include short and longterm marketable securities debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages 

  

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10 fluctuation in interest rates was assumed since the notes were “outof themoney” at yearend they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio on these bases the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is 09 million and 23 million as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively

products 

  

semiconductor test systems 

  

teradyne produces semiconductor test systems which test a wide variety of “system on a chip” “soc” semiconductor devices during the manufacturing process these devices contain integrated analog digital and memory functions which allow an entire system or subsystem to reside on a single device or “chip” these chips are used in automotive communications consumer computer and electronic game applications among others semiconductor test systems are sold to integrated device manufacturers “idms” fabless companies and to subcontractors “subcons” subcons provide test and assembly services for the final packaged devices to both fabless companies and idms fabless companies perform the design of integrated circuits without manufacturing capabilities and use foundries for wafer manufacturing and subcons for test and assembly these customers use teradyne’s semiconductor test systems to 

  

     

      

with the overall benefit of comprehensively testing advanced performance devices while reducing their total costs associated with testing the systems work in both wafer probe test and final package test applications 

  

soc devices span a huge range of functionality from very simple lowcost devices such as operational amplifiers or voltage regulators to complex digital signal processors and microprocessors teradyne offers a suite of test solutions to cover this range in the most economical way for each segment the main test equipment products are described below 

  

the j750 and j750k test systems are designed to address the highest volume semiconductor devices devices such as microcontrollers are at the heart of almost every consumer electronics product from small appliances to automotive engine controllers these devices are produced in enormous quantities the lowest cost of test at very high production throughput rates is essential to meeting the economic requirements in these markets teradyne’s j750 test systems combine compact packaging high throughput and ease of production test these benefits are possible due to the high level of integration in the design a single circuit board in the j750 test system provides up to 64 digital inputoutput channels this innovative approach eliminated the traditional “mainframe” creating a “tester in the test head” or “zero footprint design” this approach allows the test system to be placed directly on top of a wafer prober without the need for any floor space for the tester itself the j750 has met with great success in the marketplace and has an installed base of over 1300 systems the j750 platform technology also has been used to create teradyne’s ip750 image sensor test system the ip750 is focused on testing image sensor devices used in digital cameras and other imaging products 

  

the catalyst and catalysttiger test systems are designed to test a broad range of higher performance soc devices the catalyst is designed to test devices requiring data rates up to 400 mega bytes per second “bps” with a broad range of analog performance over 1200 catalyst systems are in use today at idms and subcons testing integrated circuits for dvd players wireless cellular phones networking appliances telecommunications systems computer peripherals and many other applications 

  

the “tiger” version of catalyst provides similar analog capability but extends the digital performance up to 32 giga bps on up to 1264 inputoutput channels this extended digital performance enables complete functional testing of the world’s most demanding soc and highspeed logic integrated circuits used in computer graphics personal computer chip set microprocessor and networking applications the tiger is installed at both idms and subcons around the world 

  

teradyne’s most recently introduced test system the flex is the beginning of the next generation of high throughput general purpose soc test systems and combines the integration and parallelism of the j750 with the synchronization and instrument flexibility of the catalyst flex employs a unique “soc tester per pin” architecture bringing a higher degree of parallelism to mixed signal and soc testing by testing more functions and more devices at the same time “in parallel” flex increases the production efficiency of soc device testing the core of flex design employs a “universal slot” concept which provides the user the flexibility to install any instrument into any of the tester “slots” flex is similar to the j750 in that the instrumentation tends to be implemented on self contained circuit boards that plug into the test head this modular design and the universal slot architecture adds a level of adaptability and flexibility to production testing which is new to the industry flex currently tests a range of devices in the consumer electronics area including automotive higher performance microcontrollers and power control flex will be expanded to test wireless other integrated mixed signal device areas and other major segments of the soc device market over time the system is also designed with an openarchitecture which allows customers and third party companies to add test capability to the system 

  

connection systems 

  

connection systems is a leader in highperformance connection systems designing and manufacturing backplane systems printed circuit boards and the industry’s leading highspeed highdensity connectors connection systems helps original equipment manufacturers “oems” solve system design challenges with integrated interconnect solutions for application in the networking communications storage computer server and medical equipment markets connection systems’ technology can be found in such products as internet routers computer servers mass data storage systems and telecommunication switches 

  

advanced printed circuit board fabrication capabilities leading connector technology and decades of backplane assembly expertise gives connection systems unique knowledge and experience with the entire signal transmission path teradyne believes this experience enables connection systems to differentiate itself in the market by providing integrated solutions for backplane systems connection systems’ engineers are involved early in their customers’ product design process to help them get to market quickly with the optimum solution for price and performance engineering support manufacturing and program management is available worldwide at connection systems’ locations in asia europe and north america to support both new product introductions and fullscale volume production 

  

connection systems’ products and services include a broad range of highspeed highdensity connectors covering multiple applications within a single system a suite of backplane connectors including gbx ™  vhdmhsd ™ and vhdm ® are utilized for traditional rightangle interface of printed circuit boards for parallel connection of printed circuit boards connection systems offers nexlev ®  vhdm stacker and hdm ® stacker these products allow designers to relocate high pin count devices onto mezzanine cards to simplify board routing in 2003 connection systems introduced the industry’s first modular optical interconnect hdoptyx ™  connection systems also offers coplanar power guidance and cabling solutions and will work with customers to develop custom products for specific applications 

  

connection systems’ printed circuit board capabilities are among the industry’s most advanced employing innovative solutions such as improving routing to remove layers or back drilling and blind or buried vias to produce enhanced signal quality andor lower cost connection systems was the first printed circuit board facility to be qualified to the military specification milprf310321a and 2 and delivers boards for mission critical applications such as radar systems and the patriot missile 

  

assembly test systems 

  

the central element of almost every electronic product is a printed circuit board assembly a circuit board assembly includes all the components and their interconnections that cause the board to perform its intended functions as more and more product functionality is packed into smaller packages such as personnel digital assistants “pdas” phone handsets and laptop computers both the circuit boards and their components become increasingly complex the circuit board assembly manufacturing process is also complex and demands a number of test and inspection steps teradyne’s assembly test equipment is used in the manufacturing process to ensure high production yields to maintain overall product quality to diagnose faults quickly where and when they occur and to reduce total manufacturing cost the teradyne assembly test product range includes the following 

  

incircuit test systems 

  

incircuit test systems examine the assembled and soldered printed circuit board for proper construction under both poweroff and poweron conditions defective components and solder joints are identified quickly and precisely high throughput relatively lowcost fault identification and diagnostic accuracy are valued features which cause incircuit testers to be used universally in virtually every electronics production line teradyne’s incircuit products support a full range of circuit board test applications including highvolume production selective or sample test prototype testing and final or system test accordingly teradyne offers a 

  

wide variety of capabilities and options with its spectrum 8000series and teststation product lines the most recent option added to the test station product is safetest technology this capability allows teradyne to test the increasing volume of lowvoltage batteryoperated electronic assemblies found in products such as laptops and pdas with no risk of damage to the productundertest teradyne believes that only its products currently have this capability teradyne has begun to receive orders from new customers on the basis of this new capability 

  

imaging inspection systems 

  

as circuit boards become increasingly dense and complex achieving the electrical contact required for the traditional incircuit test method is becoming more difficult timeconsuming and expensive “loss of electrical access” is a primary driver behind the increasing popularity of imaging inspection systems which examine the circuit board for physical qualities including correct component presence and orientation the absence of electrical opens and solder quality teradyne’s axi imaging inspection systems employ automated xray inspection “axi” which captures an xray image of the board teradyne believes axi is the only technology that is capable of analyzing hidden solderrelated defects teradyne’s xstation 4000 axi product line offers surface mount technology linespeed throughput with high resolution using xray transmission technology 

  

militaryaerospace test  diagnostics 

  

the milaero test product line applies teradyne’s expertise in the functional test and diagnosis of assemblies of electronics to the military and commercial aerospace markets these solutions come in the form of systems instruments and software products 

  

teradyne’s traditional focus in the military market has been to provide test and diagnostic solutions for factory and depot level maintenance and repair activities these solutions are typically deployed in stable fixed environments with an emphasis on fast accurate diagnostics down to a repairable component on a replaceable unit teradyne has recently begun to exploit architectural components that allow the repackaging of assembly test systems solutions into smaller lighter ruggedized implementations enabling teradyne to expand its served markets to include the mobile environments of the military market the requirements here are to isolate failures down to the smallest replaceable unit in a mobile harsh environment the failed unit is then passed back to the depot or factory for further diagnosis down to the repairable component before being cycled back into stock in the commercial aerospace market teradyne utilizes the same functional test and diagnostics capabilities that apply to military markets to test the increasingly complex electronic functions found in today’s aircraft 

  

the success of assembly test systems’ milaero product line has been demonstrated by recent design wins on major department of defense programs such as the f35 joint strike fighter the b1b bomber c17 and rtcass as well as with aerospace customers such as boeing teradyne believes these design wins lay the foundation for significant growth potential as teradyne is serving much larger markets than in the past 

  

diagnostic solutions 

  

diagnostic solutions provides electronic test and diagnostic systems to the automotive oem’s and their major subcontractors the systems are used throughout the vehicle’s lifecycle from design through manufacture to after sale service and consist of highly integrated software and hardware components as the number and complexity of electronic systems and embedded software proliferate in vehicles the ability to manufacture and service those vehicles becomes increasingly dependent on electronic diagnostic equipment diagnostic solutions’ products fall into two categories 

  

vehicle configuration and test solutions “vcats” 

  

diagnostic solution’s vcats products are used on automotive and major automotive subassembly production lines diagnostic solution’s connects to the vehicle to test and program or “configure” the electronic 

  

systems on vehicles these vehicle electronic systems include engine control modules and subsystems such as braking navigation and air conditioning diagnostic solutions is also able to link to an oem’s manufacturing control system in order to provide statistical quality reports to operators and management in addition diagnostic solutions also provides vcats solutions to subcontractors to the oems 

  

oem service diagnostics 

  

oem dealer service technicians use diagnostic solutions’ systems to find faults in vehicles in use by their customers and to reduce oem warranty costs historically the focus has been on fixing faults in the service bay but is growing to include constant monitoring of the vehicle to predict and prevent failure 

  

both vcats and oem service diagnostics products utilize diagnostic solutions’ “gradex” authoring software enabling the manufacturing and service phases of vehicle development diagnostics for electronic modules and systems used on diagnostic solutions’ customers’ vehicles can be developed and written using the gradex authoring software the actual diagnosis of a customer’s vehicle occurs in the oem dealer’s service bay utilizing a runtime portion of the software to facilitate the service and repair of the vehicle 

  

broadband test systems 

  

broadband test provides test systems for voice and digital subscriber line “dsl” telephone networks and highspeed internet test products for cable networks teradyne’s celerity systems are equipped on approximately 30 million subscriber lines to qualify dsl services provided by major telephone companies testing more than 120 million access lines worldwide for many of the world’s largest telecommunications companies teradyne’s 4tel is designed to reduce operating costs by accurately detecting and identifying faults within the copper access network and providing a dispatch statement to customer service representatives 

  

teradyne products within the broadband test systems market include 

  

4tel  4tel ii voice service test systems 

  

teradyne’s 4tel voice service test system automates the process to accurately identify and isolate faults within the copper access network including the “last mile of copper” between the home to the central office exchange the 4tel ii voice service test system is a software upgrade to 4tel that uses expert system technology to further isolate faults primarily between the consumers’ premises and outside copper plant without the need to install a remote isolation device “rid” at the consumers’ premises 

  

the 4tel and 4tel ii systems enable telephone companies to automate customer care and field repair processes resulting in substantial reductions in network maintenance and operating costs 

  

celerity tm dsl test system 

  

telephone companies need to know which telephone lines between the central office and the consumer are qualified for broadband dsl service before committing service to consumers existing cable records are typically not sufficient teradyne’s celerity uses accurate insertion loss length and load coil detection to qualify millions of lines in hours for dsl service the system augments the phone company’s system showing which lines are qualified which lines require conditioning and which lines are disqualified this information is then used to support dsl pointofsale and marketing efforts celerity finds more dslready lines in the network that can be sold to residential and small business customers it also helps reduce the cost of provisioning dsl through automation of the loop qualification process and reduction of field dispatches 

  

  

celerity provides reactive ondemand testing for inservice dsl lines to support fault isolation and dispatch after dsl service is installed the requirement is to accurately determine whether the copper loop has a problem that requires a repair line test systems in use today for voice service normally cannot detect certain dslrelated problems affecting physical faults and may incorrectly conclude that faults affecting voice also affect dsl the celerity system enables a repair technician or call center receptionist to determine the cause of a dslrelated problem by identifying both the type of problem on the line and the dispatch location of the fault this capability reduces operating costs and decreases dsl maintenance costs 

  

netflare tm for cable highspeed data “hsi” service assurance 

  

netflare’s patented design quickly performs the complex diagnostics required to identify and locate cable hsi performance and connectivity problems endtoend performance is tested from the subscriber’s perspective identifying specific jurisdictions operating below service expectations connectivity problems in the access network are located for proper dispatch to repair by automating otherwise manual troubleshooting procedures operating costs can be reduced and consistent problem handling can be ensured for each subscriber reported problem 

  

netflare is a serverbased web solution requiring only a web browser for access thereby eliminating the overhead of distributing software to end user desktops and laptops data generated by the netflare proprietary ip test suite combined with industry standard cable modem data provides for accurate analysis of service faults and dispatch for repair 

  

broadband access to the internet is provided through telephonedsl cable or wireless technologies while dsl is a global leader cable is the dominant supplier in the us in the race to acquire broadband subscribers a major issue for cable providers is cost effective management of the field installation and repair workforce netflare went into trial in the latter half of 2003 with the service verification application to address this problem in the cable market 

  

summary of net revenue by operating segment 

  

teradyne’s four principal operating segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of last three years

sales and distribution 

  

prices for teradyne’s systems can reach 3 million or more in 2003 2002 and 2001 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of teradyne’s consolidated net revenue in each of the years 2003 2002 and 2001 teradyne’s three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 21 23 and 24 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

  

direct sales to united states government agencies accounted for less than 2 of consolidated net revenue in 2003 2002 and 2001 approximately 12 and 10 of assembly test systems revenue in 2003 and 2002 respectively was to united states government agencies and 28 15 and 27 of assembly test systems revenue in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively was to customers who are government contractors 

  

teradyne has sales and service offices located throughout north america asia and europe as teradyne’s customers outside the united states are located primarily in these geographic areas teradyne sells in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force although teradyne conducts manufacturing activities outside the us as detailed in item 2—properties teradyne’s manufacturing activities are primarily conducted in the united states sales to customers outside the united states accounted for 63 of consolidated net revenue in 2003 54 in 2002 and 49 in 2001 sales to customers located in singapore were 11 of consolidated net revenue in 2003 8 of consolidate net revenue in 2002 and 4 of consolidated net revenue in 2001 sales to customers located in taiwan were 9 of consolidated net revenue in 2003 and 2002 and 10 of consolidated net revenue in 2001 sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site 

  

teradyne is subject to the inherent risks involved in international trade such as 

  

          

teradyne attempts to reduce the effects of currency fluctuations by hedging those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and by conducting some of its international transactions in us dollars or dollar equivalents see also “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks” and “note f financial instruments” in notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

competition 

  

teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its operating segments some of teradyne’s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers some of teradyne’s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those teradyne currently offers teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of teradyne’s products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially adversely affect teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

backlog 

  

at december 31 2003 and 2002 teradyne’s backlog of unfilled orders in each of its four principal operating segments was as follows 

  

   

the increase in semiconductor test systems backlog from 2002 to 2003 of 94 million was due to a sharp increase in the demand for testers at the end of 2003 the decrease in connection systems backlog from 2002 to 2003 of 29 million was primarily due to a decrease in the storage market as a result of teradyne’s decision to exit the lower margin electronic manufacturing services “ems” business of the backlog at december 31 2003 approximately 99 of the semiconductor test systems backlog 99 of the connection systems backlog 84 of assembly test systems backlog and 93 of the other test systems backlog is expected to be delivered in 2004 generally teradyne’s backlog policy requires delivery of products and services within twelve months 

  

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders teradyne’s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

raw materials 

  

teradyne’s products require a wide variety of electronic and mechanical components from 3000 suppliers of which 47 represent 80 of the spending teradyne can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items additionally teradyne could experience a temporary adverse impact if any of its sole source suppliers ceased to deliver products approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive any prolonged inability to obtain adequate supplies or any other circumstances that would require teradyne to seek alternative sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

  

patents and licenses 

  

teradyne’s development of its products both hardware and software is based in significant part on proprietary information and technology teradyne protects its rights in proprietary information and technology through various methods such as 

  

         

however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit teradyne’s proprietary technology andor information in countries where teradyne lacks enforceable intellectual property rights “ip” or enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also ip protections can be invalidated through legal processes while teradyne does not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to its business if a significant portion of teradyne’s intellectual property or proprietary rights is invalidated or ineffective teradyne’s business could be materially adversely affected 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2003 teradyne employed approximately 6100 people since the inception of teradyne’s business there have been no work stoppages or other labor disturbances teradyne has no collective bargaining contracts 

  

engineering and development activities 

  

the highly technical nature of teradyne’s products requires a large and continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development expenditures were 2546 million in 2003 2939 million in 2002 and 2873 million in 2001 these expenditures amounted to approximately 19 of consolidated net revenue in 2003 24 in 2002 and 20 in 2001 

  

environmental affairs 

  

teradyne is subject to various federal state and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment teradyne accrues for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that teradyne will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated the amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of investigation estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of teradyne’s operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations 

  

in 2001 teradyne was designated as a “potentially responsible party” “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arises out of teradyne’s acquisition of perception laminates inc in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july 30 1992 neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los angeles site teradyne has asked the state of california to drop the prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so management does not believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such outcome would not have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position or results of operations

after the august 2000 acquisition of herco technology corp and perception laminates inc the former owners of those companies filed a complaint on september 5 2001 against teradyne and two of its executive officers the case is now pending in federal district court in san diego california teradyne and the two individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety the court granted the motion in part and the only remaining claims were that the sale of teradyne’s common stock to the former owners violated certain california securities statutes and common law and that teradyne breached certain contractual obligations in the agreements relating to the acquisitions teradyne’s subsequent motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the breach of contract claims was granted on november 7 2002 on december 9 2002 the plaintiffs filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its summary judgment ruling or alternatively for certification under rule 54b which would grant the plaintiffs leave to appeal both the court’s ruling regarding dismissal of claims and its ruling granting summary judgment to the ninth circuit court of appeals teradyne opposed these motions on april 22 2003 the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration and the plaintiffs’ request for certification under rule 54b a small portion of the original complaint relating to alleged fraud in connection with setting the transaction price remains pending before the district court teradyne has answered and denied all liability discovery proceedings are continuing 

  

teradyne and two of its executive officers were named as defendants in three purported class action complaints that were filed in federal district court boston massachusetts in october and november 2001 the court consolidated the cases and has appointed three lead plaintiffs on november 8 2002 plaintiffs filed and served a consolidated amended class action complaint the complaint alleges among other things that the defendants violated sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 by making during the period from july 14 2000 until october 17 2000 material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing public regarding teradyne’s business operations and future prospects the complaint seeks unspecified damages including compensatory damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs teradyne filed a motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint on february 7 2003 on april 9 2003 the lead plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to teradyne’s motion to dismiss on may 28 2003 teradyne filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint oral arguments in connection with teradyne’s motion to dismiss were presented to the district court on june 26 2003 claims asserted in this case are similar to the claims asserted in the california securities case discussed above which is pending in the federal district court in san diego california on january 16 2004 the us magistrate judge recommended to the us district court that teradyne’s motion to dismiss the consolidated amended class action complaint in its entirety be allowed without prejudice on february 2 2004 the lead plaintiffs filed an objection to the us magistrate judge’s recommendation teradyne is currently preparing its response to the lead plaintiffs’ objection teradyne believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend itself vigorously 

  

on may 23 2003 electro mechanical solutions inc “ems” and several affiliated debtors including precismetals collectively the “debtors” filed a complaint against teradyne in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california alleging that teradyne received payments in 2001 totaling 127 million from the debtors in the 90 days prior to the bankruptcy filing and that those payments constitute avoidable preferential transfers on june 30 2003 teradyne filed its answer and denied all liability on january 6 2004 the debtors and teradyne entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which teradyne will pay ems an immaterial amount in exchange for a full release of all claims by the debtors and the allowance in full of teradyne’s us 69 million unsecured claim in the ongoing bankruptcy proceeding the debtors and teradyne are awaiting approval of the executed settlement agreement by the us trustee and bankruptcy court 

  

in august of 2003 teradyne was notified by one of its suppliers connector service corporation aka amax plating inc “csc” of potential claims and liabilities relating to a supply agreement and course of dealings between csc and teradyne in addition hampshire equity partners ii lp “hep” an investor in csc 

  

and its majority shareholder has informed teradyne that it may make a claim involving misrepresentations allegedly made by teradyne with respect to csc’s existing business operations and future business prospects with teradyne on september 3 2003 teradyne terminated the supply and service agreement with csc although teradyne continued to purchase from csc until september 24 2003 on september 24 2003 csc filed a petition for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois the “petition” on october 16 2003 teradyne entered into an agreement with csc allowing for postpetition purchases on january 29 2004 csc and teradyne entered into a settlement agreement which was approved by order of the bankruptcy court on the same day on february 9 2004 the bankruptcy court order became final and nonappealable pursuant to the settlement agreement and final order relating thereto teradyne will pay a total of 08 million to the estate andor creditors of csc for the purchase of spare parts documented csc specialized knowledge the return of teradyne’s dies and tools and a release of claims by the debtors relating to csc’s estate teradyne continues to investigate the hep allegations although hep has not commenced litigation against teradyne seeking damages in connection with its investment in csc it could do so at any time 

  

  

teradyne has also been designated as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to an environmental cleanup matter at a site in california see the discussion of this item in item 1 “environmental matters” above 

  

teradyne is not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to any of the claims above teradyne disputes all of the claims above and believes they are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against them management does not believe that the outcomes of any of the above referenced claims will have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position or results of operations but a presently unexpected adverse resolution of any of these claims could have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position andor results of operations 

  

in addition teradyne is subject to legal proceedings claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as but not limited to patent commercial and environmental matters there are no such matters pending that teradyne expects to be material with respect to its business financial position or results of operation but there can be no assurance that any such matters would not have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the historical information contained in this document the discussion in this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements made pursuant to section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of teradyne’s plans expectations and intentions the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form 10k should be read as being applicable to all related forwardlooking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form 10k teradyne’s actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forwardlooking statements factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in “certain factors that may affect future results” and elsewhere herein 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results 

  

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis managment evaluates its estimates including those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other longlived assets bad debts income taxes pensions warranties contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in accordance with the guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to teradyne’s customers upon shipment in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination acceptance or cash payment teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur 

  

for equipment where there is hardware and software that is incidental to the product revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment certain contracts require teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications which are generally conducted prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment or in the case of new products revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received for multiple element arrangements teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit the delivered 

  

item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of teradyne teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately teradyne’s postshipment obligations include installation training services oneyear standard warranties and extended warranties installation does not alter the product capabilities does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter training services are optional and do not affect the customer’s ability to use the product teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and teradyne defers revenue in accordance with fasb technical bulletin 901 teradyne’s products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 

  

connection systems revenue is generally recognized upon shipment according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements 

  

teradyne generally does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products 

  

for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement of position no 972 “sop 972” “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop no 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable revenue is deferred in instances when vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered elements is not determinable vendorspecific evidence of fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 

  

for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs these arrangements require significant production modification or customization in all cases changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined with respect to contract change orders claims or similar items judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 

  

inventories 

  

inventories which include materials labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value on a quarterly basis teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses 

  

stock option and stock purchase plans 

  

teradyne accounts for its employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” and related interpretations teradyne’s employee stock purchase plan is a noncompensatory plan teradyne’s stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb 25 there have been no charges for employee or director stock options or employee stock purchase plans proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of the employee stock purchase plan under teradyne’s stock plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paidin capital 

  

teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under statement of financial accounting standard no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “fas 123” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stock based compensation – transition and disclosure” see “note b accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information 

  

income taxes 

  

on a quarterly basis teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance as a result of its review undertaken at december 31 2002 teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance due to the continued uncertainty of realization teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at december 31 2003 teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence including profitability exists that realization is more likely than not 

  

goodwill intangible and longlived assets 

  

teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of teradyne’s use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends when teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter on a reporting unit basis or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

the volatility of the industries that teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows which can impact their ability to make required payments teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customer’s current payment history the customer’s current financial statements and other information regarding the customer’s credit worthiness if the financial condition of teradyne’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required

results of operations 

  

business overview 

  

teradyne’s operating results were adversely affected by the recent severe technology and semiconductor downturn which affected the semiconductor industry and caused a general reduction in capital spending as a result of the challenging economic conditions teradyne has taken significant cost structure initiatives to more appropriately size the business actions taken include reductions in workforce across all groups which has led to the consolidation and reorganization of certain functions curtailment of discretionary expenses shifts of manufacturing and some shared services operations to lower cost regions reductions in the number of operating facilities and the outsourcing of certain manufacturing and applications development in addition teradyne has eliminated certain product lines to efficiently allocate engineering and development spending to areas that provide a high potential for growth recent increases in business activity indicate that the industry is in the midst of a recovery leading to the next growth cycle in the fourth quarter of 2003 teradyne’s net bookings increased 45 sequentially and worldwide semiconductor test utilization levels climbed to levels which had not been seen since the past business peak in 2000 

  

although sales remained relatively flat throughout the four quarters of 2003 net bookings increased almost 40 from the first to the second half of the year 

  

bookings 

  

teradyne’s net orders for its four principal operating segments for 2003 2002 and 2001 are as follows 

  

   

from 2002 to 2003 the growth in orders shifted more heavily to subcons in taiwan singapore and other parts of asia during the last quarter of 2003 teradyne saw a rise in bookings driven primarily by semiconductor testing needs for the wireless and baseband industries whose chips are sold mainly by european and us semiconductor companies these chips are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcons in many parts of asia but concentrated in taiwan and singapore and increasingly in china the economic downturn which prevailed in the past years has pushed companies to lower fixed costs as a result an increasing trend by chip makers has been to outsource their noncore competency testing needs to subcons in lowcost regions as teradyne’s total semiconductor test systems bookings have grown the bookings from subcons have continued to make up a larger percentage of total orders bookings from subcons increased 325 from 72 million in 2002 to 307 million in 2003 and made up 37 of total semiconductor test systems bookings in 2003 compared to 15 of total semiconductor test systems bookings in 2002 in 2001 excess inventory slower economic growth and a reduction in enduser demand of electronic goods by teradyne’s semiconductor test systems’ customers resulted in a reduction in capital spending as well as cancellations or postponements of previously placed orders from 2001 to 2002 semiconductor test systems bookings grew primarily as a result of increased demand for soc products by both idms and subcons 

  

the increase in connection systems bookings from 2002 to 2003 was due in part to a decrease in cancellations in 2003 as well as an increase in demand in the telecommunications market driven by wireless network deployments which increased appreciably for both us and european telecommunications equipment providers in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the first half of 2003 teradyne’s highspeed highdensity interconnect and backplane solutions such as vhdmhsd ™  are well positioned in this market bookings were up modestly in the computerserver market and down in the storage market as connection systems exited a lower margin ems product line and repositioned itself to support its core products from 2001 to 2002 bookings were impacted by significant cancellations along with a decline in demand of over 50 from key communications customers year over year 

  

the net decrease in assembly test systems orders from 2002 to 2003 is due primarily to the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual xray and rework product lines this decrease was offset by a 25 increase in orders by government agencies and contractors in the milaero business which had a twofold increase in orders from the first half to the second half of 2003 the increase in orders from 2001 to 2002 largely resulted from the full year impact of the genrad acquisition the first half of 2001 had strong orders from contract manufacturers in the incircuit test business but demand weakened as a result of the sluggish economy in the latter half of 2001 and into 2002 

  

the increase in other test systems bookings from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to the addition of diagnostic solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the acquisition of genrad which includes diagnostic systems which is included in the other test systems segment 

  

teradyne’s cancellations for its four principal operating segments for the last three years are as follows 

  

   

the semiconductor test systems cancellations were largely due to orders that were booked in late 2000 and early 2001 by subcons in anticipation of a further increase in their own demand cancellations in the connection systems business came from major customers in the telecommunication and information technology infrastructure industries as their own demand levels dropped 

  

teradyne’s net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows 

  

   

for the past three years teradyne’s backlog of unfilled orders for its four principal operating segments is as follows 

  

   

customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties in 2003 2002 and 2001 there were no significant cancellation penalties received due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders teradyne’s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue 

  

teradyne’s net revenue for its four principal operating segments for 2003 2002 and 2001 is as follows 

  

   

more than half of the semiconductor test systems sales increase from 2002 to 2003 is attributable to growing sales to subcons for use in their asian facilities primarily singapore taiwan and malaysia the revenue derived from subcons was driven by higher demand from their mixed signal soc customers led by sales of catalyst and tiger systems as is described in the bookings section semiconductor test systems has seen a recent growth in revenue due to increased need for testing in the wireless and baseband sectors to a lesser extent the semiconductor test systems segment continues to see revenue growth in the optical disk sector automotive applications testing and image sensor testing included in 2001 semiconductor test systems sales is 987 million from the accounting impact of the implementation of staff accounting bulletin no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” in the fourth quarter of 2000 due to shipments of customer orders in 2000 where title was retained by teradyne until customer payment in order to perfect a security interest 

  

connection systems sales declined from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the decision to exit the lower margin ems business the segment saw downward pricing pressure throughout the past three years 

  

the increase in assembly test systems revenue from 2001 to 2002 largely resulted from the full year impact of the genrad acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2001 from the second half of 2001 through 2003 the commercial business saw decreases in revenue particularly in the incircuit test business while the milaero business has seen steady revenue numbers throughout the past three years 

  

the increase in other test systems revenue from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to the addition of diagnostic solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the acquisition of genrad which includes diagnostic solutions which is included in the other test systems segment 

  

teradyne’s four principal operating segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of last three years 

  

   

teradyne’s net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows 

  

   

teradyne’s product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows 

  

   

service revenue is derived from the servicing of teradyne’s installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts repairs extended warranties parts sales and applications support 

  

in the past three years no single customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net revenue in 2003 2002 and 2001 teradyne’s three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 21 23 and 24 of consolidated net revenue respectively 

  

gross margin 

  

   

teradyne’s gross margin improvement from 2002 to 2003 was impacted by a variety of factors including manufacturing efficiencies lower inventory provisions and volume and product mix gross margin improvement of 49 points is attributed to reduced fixed manufacturing costs including depreciation and facility costs resulting from restructuring actions primarily taken in the second half of 2002 along with increased sales volumes which resulted in higher utilization an improvement of 25 points of gross margin is credited to a shift in teradyne’s mix of revenues with a higher percentage in 2003 being derived from semiconductor test systems which has higher incremental margins coupled with a shift in teradyne’s supply chain to low cost regions inventory provisions decreased from 390 million in 2002 to 166 million in 2003 which contributed a 20 point gross margin improvement 

  

teradyne’s gross margin remained relatively flat from 2001 to 2002 and was impacted by a variety of factors including lower inventory provisions offset by pricing pressures and lower utilization of fixed manufacturing costs as sales volumes decreased inventory provisions decreased from 1397 million in 2001 to 390 million in 2002 which contributed a 65 point gross margin improvement as sales volumes decreased from 2001 to 2002 and certain components of cost of revenues remained fixed gross margin was negatively impacted by 18 points due to the lower utilization of manufacturing overhead pricing pressures net of product mix and cost reduction activities in the second half of 2002 resulted in a 16 point decrease in gross margin 

  

the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows 

  

   

teradyne assesses the carrying value of its inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against onhand and onorder inventory positions forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory obsolete inventory which represents items for which there is no demand is fully reserved excess inventory which represents inventory items that are 

  

not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters is writtendown to estimated net realizable value the activity with respect to the provisions recorded for excess and obsolete inventory for 2003 2002 and 2001 is as follows 

  

   

teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory 

  

the yearly provisions consisted of obsolete and excess inventory as follows 

  

   

teradyne’s writedowns and writeoffs consisted of raw material and components the provisions were accounted for in the following segments 

  

   

of the inventory provision recorded in 2003 93 million relates to assembly test systems which includes 36 million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing distributing and primary support of the aoi product line and 52 million relates to semiconductor test systems soc parts and components 

  

of the inventory provision recorded in 2002 for semiconductor test systems 207 million was in memory test related to probeone and j996 product line discontinuances the probeone and j996 inventory has been fully writtenoff as of december 31 2003 there is no material exposure remaining for the probeone or j996 products 

  

the total 2001 inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory was 1397 million and was principally due to the sharp decline in incoming semiconductor test systems and connection systems orders of the 2001 provision for semiconductor test systems 863 million was related to soc parts and 323 million was for memory product parts and components related to an inventory writedown for the discontinuance of teradyne’s flash 750 memory product 

  

teradyne currently does not believe there is any material remaining exposure for the other products that teradyne continues to actively market although our estimates of future demand may differ from actual demand which may result in additional provisions as of december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 teradyne had inventory related reserves for amounts which have been writtendown or writtenoff of 1911 million and 2208 million respectively 

  

engineering and development 

  

   

throughout the downturn teradyne has maintained its commitment to sustained levels of investment in research through continued engineering and development spending more than twothirds of teradyne’s total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test systems segment where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between 150250 million during the past three years semiconductor test systems has reduced the number of platforms under major development which has increased the resources for remaining platforms the consolidation of multiple product divisions within semiconductor test systems into one group has enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation semiconductor test systems has consolidated engineering facilities outsourced certain software engineering development to a lowcost region and limited the amount of engineering work done by outside consultants in an effort to reduce overall costs 

  

the reduction in engineering and development expenses from 2002 to 2003 resulted primarily from the exiting of product lines within semiconductor test systems and assembly test systems the elimination of memory test within the semiconductor test systems segment resulted in a reduction of 13 million and 5 million in engineering expenses from 2001 to 2002 and 2002 to 2003 respectively as a result of the sale in assembly test systems of its manufacturing software product line and manual xray inspection and rework product line as well as the discontinuance of the automated optical inspection products engineering expenses from 2002 to 2003 decreased by approximately 15 million 

  

the decrease from 2002 to 2003 in engineering and development spending resulting from the discontinuance of product lines and actions taken to reduce costs consists of the following amounts 

  

   

     

the increase in spending from 2001 to 2002 in engineering and development was primarily due to 

  

    

the additional engineering and development expense in 2001 compared to 2002 was partially offset by actions taken to reduce costs which consist of the following 

  

      

selling and administrative 

  

   

the decrease in spending from 2002 to 2003 was principally due to the following approximate amounts 

  

      

the increase in spending from 2001 to 2002 in selling and administrative was principally due to the additional expense base resulting from teradyne’s purchase of genrad in the fourth quarter of 2001 with an additional increase coming from the granting of the prior year’s previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of 2002 the additional selling and administrative expense was partially offset by workforce reductions and other actions taken to reduce costs which consisted of the following 

  

    

restructuring and other charges 

  

the table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended december 31 2003 relating to restructuring and other charges 

  

   

the accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees’ compensation and withholdings the accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms the latest of which expires in 2012 teradyne expects to pay out 7 million against the lease accrual over the next twelve months teradyne’s future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of 13 million as of december 31 2003 teradyne has subleased approximately 16 of its unoccupied space as of december 31 2003 and is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space prior to january 1 2003 teradyne recorded restructuring charges for its unoccupied facilities leased under operating leases at the time teradyne committed to the plan to permanently vacate the facilities the restructuring charges were based on the difference between the remaining contractual lease commitment after the facilities were to be vacated net of teradyne’s estimated probable sublease income for actions initiated after january 1 2003 the restructuring charges were based on the difference between the remaining contractual lease commitment net of teradyne’s estimated probable sublease income once teradyne ceased using the facilities

goodwill impairment 

  

unless conditions dictate otherwise teradyne’s annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year teradyne tested both reporting units assembly test systems and connection systems for impairment during its annual test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in either reporting unit as of december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

during the quarter ended september 28 2003 teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue bookings and profit for the fiscal years 2004 through 2006 from the previous quarter’s forecast for the assembly test systems segment and reduced its workforce by 112 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook as a result teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the assembly test systems segment as of september 28 2003 teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the assembly test systems segment did not exceed its fair value and thus no impairment charge was recorded the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows

gain on the sale of a business 

  

on june 22 2001 teradyne sold its aerospace and defense connector and backplane business to amphenol corporation of wallingford connecticut for cash proceeds of 263 million this transaction resulted in a gain of 148 million 

  

interest income and expense 

  

   

the decrease in interest income from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates the decrease in interest income from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to lower interest rates 

  

the decrease in interest expense from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of teradyne’s california mortgage in the third quarter of 2003 which reduced interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2003 the increase in interest expense from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to interest expense related to convertible notes which teradyne issued in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

other income and expense net 

  

other income and expense net for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 includes the following 

  

   

   

   

   

loss before income taxes 

  

   

the decrease in the loss before income taxes from 2002 to 2003 in semiconductor test systems connection systems and assembly test systems was primarily due to cost reduction actions in the respective 

  

segments and market conditions during the year other test systems income before income taxes increased primarily due to increased revenues from 2002 to 2003 

  

the increase in the loss before income taxes from 2001 to 2002 in semiconductor test systems connection systems and assembly test systems was due to decreased sales in semiconductor test systems and connection systems and goodwill and intangible asset impairments in assembly test systems and the declining market conditions other test systems income before income taxes increased due to the addition of diagnostic solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the genrad acquisition 

  

income taxes 

  

for the year ended december 31 2003 tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in 2003 until sufficient positive evidence exists including an appropriate level of profitability teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 teradyne recorded a tax provision of 1575 million resulting in a tax rate of 28 the tax rate of 28 is primarily due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2002 teradyne recorded a tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable the evidence that teradyne reviewed during the fourth quarter of 2002 included actual revenues and net loss for the fiscal year 2002 compared to earlier teradyne forecasts the inability to get to breakeven during 2002 despite implementing several restructuring programs and a reduction in revenues and an increase in the loss forecasted for the fiscal year 2003 as a result of its review undertaken at december 31 2002 teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized 

  

the effective tax rate benefit for the year ended 2001 was 38 teradyne’s effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2001 primarily reflects the us statutory income tax rate the net effect of state taxes and the effect of tax benefits from its ireland manufacturing operations tax exemptions relating to ireland operations are effective through 2010 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table reflects teradyne’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 

  

   

     

liquidity and capital resources 

  

teradyne’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased 449 million in 2003 from 2002 to 5860 million teradyne’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased 451 million in 2002 from 2001 to 5411 million and increased 1218 million in 2001 from 2000 to 5862 million cash activity for 2003 2002 and 2001 was as follows 

  

   

changes in operating assets and liabilities net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired provided cash of 189 million in 2003 as inventory balances decreased 563 million across each of teradyne’s segments although primarily in the semiconductor test systems segment and accounts payable deferred revenue and accruals increased by 240 million due to the increase in business in the fourth quarter of 2003 which is partially offset by a contribution to teradyne’s us qualified pension plan of approximately 10 million the inventory and accounts payable deferred revenue and accrual balances were partially offset by an increase of 583 million in the accounts receivable balances primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues from 478 days in 2002 to 586 days in 2003 teradyne plans to contribute 25 million to its us qualified pension plan in 2004 changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of 2031 million in 2002 primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances of 937 million across all segments and the receipt of a tax refund of 852 million in march of 2002 changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of 1368 million in 2001 as accounts payable deferred revenue and accruals balances decreased as purchases slowed but were offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory due to market conditions 

  

investing activities consist of purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities proceeds from the sale of businesses proceeds for asset disposals proceeds from the sale of product lines cash acquired in business acquisitions cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets capital expenditures increased by 48 million in 2003 compared to 2002 all operating segments increased capital expenditures except the connection systems segment which decreased capital expenditures by 92 million in 2003 compared to 2002 the increase in capital expenditures in the other segments was driven by an increase in equipment manufactured by teradyne capital expenditures were 812 million in 2003 764 million in 2002 and 2414 million in 2001 

  

financing activities include the issuance of convertible notes mortgage borrowings sales of teradyne’s common stock as well as repayments of debt during 2003 repayments of longterm debt used cash of 434 million as teradyne prepaid its mortgage on its california properties in the third quarter of 2003 in 2001 teradyne assumed debt of 897 million from the genrad acquisition which teradyne repaid on october 26 2001 during 2003 2002 and 2001 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated 1005 million 412 million and 585 million respectively 

  

on october 24 2001 teradyne issued 400 million principal amount of 375 convertible senior notes due 2006 the “notes” in a private placement and received net proceeds of 389 million the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 

  

2600 per share which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 384615 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes teradyne began making annual interest payments of 15 million paid semiannually on the notes commencing on april 15 2002 the notes are senior unsecured obligations of teradyne that rank equally with teradyne’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness in the event of a change in control by which teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party the holders of the notes may be able to require teradyne to redeem some or all of the notes either in discounted teradyne common stock or in cash on february 8 2002 the securities and exchange commission declared effective a registration statement on form s3 covering both the notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted 

  

on or after october 18 2004 teradyne may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below the redemption price expressed as a percentage of principal amount is as follows for the designated periods 

  

   

and thereafter equal to 100 of the principal amount presently it is management’s intent to convert a portion of the notes into equity at or around october 18 2004 if teradyne’s stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately 2600 per share to avoid the continuation of the annual interest payment of 15 million however there can be no assurance that even if teradyne’s stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the notes will convert into equity as teradyne’s stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date if this were to occur teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the notes called into cash there are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including teradyne’s stock price teradyne’s available cash and marketable securities and teradyne’s anticipated future liquidity needs 

  

on december 19 2001 teradyne obtained a loan of approximately 45 million in the form of a 75 mortgage loan on its california properties maturing on january 1 2007 the “mortgage” teradyne prepaid the mortgage in the third quarter of 2003 prior to the prepayment principal payments were made according to a twentyyear amortization schedule through december 2006 with the remaining principal due on january 1 2007 

  

on october 26 2001 teradyne completed its acquisition of genrad inc of westford ma a leading manufacturer of electronic automatic test equipment related software and diagnostic solutions genrad’s business has been made part of the assembly test systems operating segment excluding the diagnostic solutions business diagnostic solutions has been made part of the other test systems operating segment under the terms of the acquisition each outstanding share of genrad common stock was converted into 01733 shares of teradyne common stock the total number of teradyne shares exchanged for the shares of genrad based on the shares of genrad outstanding as of the closing was approximately 50 million 

  

teradyne believes its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of 5860 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months teradyne plans to contribute approximately 25 million in 2004 to teradyne’s us qualified pension plan which is currently underfunded inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings 

  

retirement plans 

  

teradyne’s pension expense which includes the us qualified pension plan certain qualified plans for nonus subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan was approximately 142 million for the year ended december 31 2003 which was 093 of teradyne’s total operating expenses the largest portion of teradyne’s 2003 pension expense was 82 million for its us qualified pension plan which is calculated 

  

based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected return on plan assets for teradyne’s us qualified pension plan assets of 8 in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants including their review of asset class return expectations teradyne also considered its historical 15year compounded return of 8 for the period ending december 31 2002 which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices based on these historical returns teradyne believes that 8 was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2003 

  

the current asset allocation for teradyne’s us qualified pension plan is 47 invested in equity securities and 53 invested in fixed income securities teradyne’s actual asset allocation as of december 31 2003 was virtually identical to its asset allocation model teradyne’s investment manager regularly reviews teradyne’s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances teradyne’s investments to teradyne’s targeted allocation when considered appropriate teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually and will adjust these returns as necessary 

  

teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return on assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized as of december 31 2003 in the us qualified pension plan teradyne had cumulative losses of approximately 170 million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets the discount rate that teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the salomon brothers pension liability index which was at 600 at december 31 2003 down from 605 at december 31 2002 as a result teradyne selected 6 for its december 31 2003 discount rate which was the same as from december 31 2002 each year teradyne considers the salomon brothers pension liability index along with other indices including the moody’s aa rated corporate bond yield and the salomon brothers 10 year aaaaa rate teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the us qualified pension plan will be approximately 63 million 66 million and 65 million in fiscal 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively the pension expense estimates are based on a 6 discount rate future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in teradyne’s pension plans 

  

teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended december 31 2003 if teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 

  

   

teradyne’s funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible the assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities the value of teradyne’s us qualified pension plan assets has increased from 982 million at december 31 2002 to 1216 million at december 31 2003 the investment performance returns and teradyne contributions have decreased the deficit of teradyne’s us qualified pension plan net of benefit obligations from 934 million at december 31 2002 to 709 million at december 31 2003 during 2003 teradyne contributed 10 million to the us qualified pension plan teradyne plans to contribute approximately 25 million in 2004 to this plan in order to meet the erisa minimum funding requirements 

  

employee stock options 

  

teradyne’s equity compensation program is a broadbased longterm retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests teradyne considers its equity compensation program critical to teradyne’s operation and productivity approximately 83 of teradyne’s employees participate in its equity compensation program of the stock options teradyne granted in 2003 88 went to employees other than the chief executive officer and the five other most highly compensated executive officers

certain factors that may affect future results 

  

from time to time information provided by teradyne statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form 10k contain statements that are not purely historical but are forward looking statements made under section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 which involve risks and uncertainties in particular forward looking statements made herein include projections plans and objectives for teradyne’s business financial condition operating results future operations or future economic performance statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to 

  

meet working capital requirements capital expenditures expectations as to customer orders and demand for teradyne’s products and statements relating to backlog bookings and cancellations gross margins and pricing considerations these statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties both known and unknown which could cause teradyne’s actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements factors that may cause such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below these factors and others are discussed from time to time in teradyne’s filings with the securities and exchange commission 

  

teradyne’s business is impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide 

  

teradyne’s business has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the global economies that began in the second half of 2000 the uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies has caused companies to reduce capital investments and may cause a further reduction of such investments these reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and semiconductor industry which teradyne serves and have contributed to teradyne incurring losses teradyne cannot predict if or when the growth rate of worldwide economies will rebound or whether the growth rate of its business will rebound when the worldwide economies begin to grow 

  

current geopolitical turmoil and the continuing threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact teradyne’s revenues 

  

international turmoil exacerbated by the war in iraq and tensions in north korea have contributed to an uncertain political and economic climate both in the united states and globally which may affect teradyne’s ability to generate revenue on a predictable basis in addition terrorist attacks internationally and the threat of future terrorist attacks both domestically and internationally have negatively impacted an already weakened worldwide economy as teradyne sells and manufacturers products both in the united states and internationally the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at those locations which could increase teradyne’s operating costs and which may adversely affect teradyne’s business these conditions make it difficult for teradyne and its customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

teradyne’s business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics 

  

teradyne’s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products the current and anticipated market demand for electronics has been impacted by the economic slowdown that began in the latter portions of 2000 and the effects of the hostilities begun in september 2001 historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems manufactured and marketed by teradyne teradyne believes that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that teradyne manufactures and markets will also be subject to similar fluctuations teradyne is dependent on the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on its results of operations teradyne cannot assure that any increase in revenues or new orders for a calendar year will be sustained in subsequent years in addition any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect teradyne’s business financial condition and operating results 

  

teradyne has taken measures to address the past slowdown in the market for its products which could have longterm negative effects on teradyne’s business 

  

teradyne has taken measures to address the slowdown in the market for its products in particular teradyne has reduced its workforce closed andor sold facilities discontinued certain of its product lines implemented material cost reduction programs and reduced its planned capital expenditures and expense budgets these 

  

measures have reduced expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders however each measure teradyne has taken to contain expenditures could have longterm negative effects on teradyne’s business by reducing its pool of technical talent decreasing or slowing improvements in its products increasing teradyne’s debt and making it more difficult for teradyne to respond to customers or competitors as the market and customer orders turn around 

  

teradyne may not be able to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 

  

because teradyne took measures during the past three years to scale back operations and reduce expenses in response to decreased customer demand for products and services and because visibility into teradyne’s market is limited teradyne may not be able to satisfy a rapid increase in customer demand as the market turns around teradyne’s ability to meet increases in customer demand is to a certain extent dependant upon the ability of its suppliers and contractors to meet increased product or delivery requirements which teradyne has little or no control over 

  

teradyne’s business may be adversely impacted by acquisitions which may affect its ability to manage and maintain its business 

  

since teradyne’s inception it has acquired a number of businesses in the future teradyne may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement its existing operations such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks including 

  

          

for example in connection with the august 2000 acquisition of each of herco technology corp a california company and perception laminates inc a california company a complaint was filed on or about september 5 2001 and is now pending in federal district court san diego california by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of its executive officers this case is further described in “part i item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

  

additionally in 2001 teradyne was designated as a “potentially responsible party” “prp” at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arises out of teradyne’s acquisition of perception laminates inc in august 2000 prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july 30 1992 this case is further described in “part i environmental affairs” in this form 10k 

  

in addition to the foregoing any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to teradyne’s expectations 

  

teradyne currently faces and in the future may be the subject of securities class action litigation due to past or future stock price volatility 

  

teradyne and two of its executive officers were named as defendants in three purported class action complaints that were filed in federal district court boston massachusetts in october and november 2001 the court consolidated the cases and has appointed three lead plaintiffs on november 8 2002 plaintiffs filed and served a consolidated amended class action complaint the complaint alleges among other things that the defendants violated sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 by making during the period from july 14 2000 until october 17 2000 material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing public regarding teradyne’s business operations and future prospects the complaint seeks unspecified damages including compensatory damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs teradyne filed a motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint on february 7 2003 on april 9 2003 the lead plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to teradyne’s motion to dismiss on may 28 2003 teradyne filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint oral arguments in connection with teradyne’s motion to dismiss were presented to the district court on june 26 2003 claims asserted in this case are similar to the claims asserted in the case discussed above which is pending in the federal district court in san diego california on january 16 2004 the us magistrate judge recommended to the us district court that teradyne’s motion to dismiss the consolidated amended class action complaint in its entirety be allowed without prejudice on february 2 2004 the lead plaintiffs filed an objection to the us magistrate judge’s recommendation teradyne is currently preparing its response to the lead plaintiffs objection teradyne believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend itself vigorously management does not believe that the outcomes of these claims will have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s financial position or results of operations 

  

teradyne’s business may be adversely impacted by divestitures of lines of business which may affect its ability to manage and maintain its business 

  

since teradyne’s inception it has divested itself of certain lines of business in the future teradyne may undertake additional divestitures such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks including 

  

       

if teradyne is unable to protect its intellectual property teradyne may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect its rights 

  

teradyne’s products incorporate technology that it protects in several ways including patents copyrights and trade secrets “ip” while teradyne believes that its ip has value in the aggregate no single element of its ip is in itself essential if a significant portion of teradyne’s ip is invalidated or ineffective teradyne’s business could be materially adversely affected in addition teradyne receives notifications from time to time that it may be in violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against teradyne if successful could have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell its products or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect its operating results 

  

if teradyne fails to develop new technologies to adapt to its customers’ needs and if its customers fail to accept its new products teradyne’s revenues will be adversely affected 

  

teradyne believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineers teradyne’s development of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to teradyne’s success successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors including 

  

       

teradyne is subject to intense competition 

  

teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its operating segments some of teradyne’s competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers some of teradyne’s competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those teradyne currently offers teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of teradyne’s products moreover increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially adversely affect teradyne’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

teradyne is subject to risks of operating internationally 

  

teradyne derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the united states the table set out below summarizes total teradyne revenue earned within the united states “us” and outside the us “nonus” for the last three fiscal years 

  

   

teradyne’s international revenues and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties including 

  

          

in addition an increasing portion of teradyne’s products are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations including china and a large portion of the devices teradyne’s products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan singapore china and other parts of asia as a result teradyne is subject to a number of economic and other risks particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact teradyne’s ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 

  

teradyne’s business may suffer if it is unable to attract and retain key employees 

  

competition for employees with skills required by teradyne is intense in the high technology industry teradyne’s success will depend on its ability to attract and retain key technical employees the loss of one or more key or other employees teradyne’s inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business results of operations or financial condition 

  

if teradyne’s suppliers do not meet teradyne’s product or delivery requirements teradyne could have reduced revenues and earnings 

  

certain components including semiconductor chips may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet teradyne’s quality or delivery requirements approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive if any of teradyne’s suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments with teradyne or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for teradyne’s products teradyne could lose timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition teradyne relies upon contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in its products and teradyne’s ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors over whom teradyne does not exercise any control 

  

in addition teradyne is dependent on the financial strength of its suppliers for example on september 24 2003 a supplier of teradyne filed a petition for chapter 11 bankruptcy while the loss of this supplier has not had a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business results of operations or financial condition there can be no assurance that the loss of other teradyne suppliers either as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business results of operations or financial condition 

  

teradyne may incur significant liabilities if it fails to comply with environmental regulations 

  

teradyne is subject to environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes if teradyne fails to comply with present and future regulations or is required to perform site remediation teradyne could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production present and future regulations may also 

  

     

pursuant to present regulations and agreements teradyne is conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and is implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations as of december 31 2003 teradyne has not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california massachusetts and new hampshire sites 

  

teradyne has substantially increased its indebtedness 

  

on october 24 2001 teradyne completed a private placement of 400 million principal amount of 375 convertible senior notes the “notes” due 2006 and received net proceeds of 389 million as a result teradyne has incurred approximately 400 million principal amount of additional indebtedness substantially increasing its ratio of debt to total capitalization the level of teradyne’s indebtedness among other things could 

  

        

there can be no assurance that teradyne will be able to meet its debt service obligations including its obligations under the notes 

  

teradyne may not be able to satisfy certain obligations in the event of a change in control 

  

the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of teradyne if a “change in control” occurs the holders of the notes have the right to require teradyne to repurchase all of the notes not previously called for redemption the price that teradyne is required to pay is 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased together with interest accrued but unpaid to but excluding the repurchase date at teradyne’s option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions instead of paying the repurchase price in cash it may pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at 95 of the average of the closing prices of common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date if teradyne is required to repurchase the notes there is no guarantee that it will have enough funds to pay such amounts 

  

as a result a change of control of teradyne could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations or financial condition 

  

teradyne may not be able to pay its debt and other obligations 

  

if teradyne’s cash flow is inadequate to meet its obligations teradyne could face substantial liquidity problems if teradyne sustains continued losses or is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of its other obligations teradyne would be in default under the terms thereof which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness teradyne may incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on teradyne’s business prospects financial position and operating results in addition teradyne cannot assure that it would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes payment if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations moreover teradyne cannot assure that it will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 

  

teradyne may need additional financing which could be difficult to obtain 

  

teradyne expects that its existing cash and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet teradyne’s cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months however teradyne has a finite amount of cash and in the event teradyne may need to raise additional funds due to ongoing losses or other reasons teradyne cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms if at all particularly in light of teradyne’s continued quarterly losses further if teradyne issues additional equity securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock future financings may place restrictions on how teradyne operates its business if teradyne cannot raise funds on acceptable terms if and when needed teradyne may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services take advantage of future opportunities grow its business or respond to competitive pressures which could seriously harm teradyne’s business 

  

if teradyne is required to account for options under its employee stock plans as a compensation expense teradyne’s compensation expense would be increased 

  

there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options teradyne currently discloses pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the grants’ fair value and disclosing the impact on net loss and net loss per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements if future laws and regulations require teradyne to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations its reported operating results will be adversely affected note b “accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on teradyne’s net loss and net loss per share if it had been in effect during the year ended december 31 2003 included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” are additional stockbased compensation disclosures 

  

provisions of teradyne’s charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 

  

teradyne’s basic corporate documents its stockholder rights plan and massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in the control of teradyne even if a change of control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of teradyne’s stockholders 

  

teradyne’s operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 

  

teradyne’s annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability with respect to the operating results for the year ending december 31 2003 the following factors materially and adversely affected revenues and profitability 

  

     

the above factors in conjunction with the additional factors set out below are expected to impact future operations 

  

     

     

in particular due to teradyne’s introduction of a number of new complex test systems in 2003 and the planned introduction of other systems in 2004 there can be no assurance that teradyne will not experience delays in shipment of its products or that its products will achieve customer acceptance 

  

as a result of the foregoing and other factors teradyne has and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition operating results and stock price 

  

teradyne’s investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if teradyne’s independent auditors are unable to provide teradyne with the attestation of the adequacy of teradyne’s internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

the securities and exchange commission as directed by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on teradyne’s internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on form 10k that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of teradyne’s internal controls over financial reporting in addition teradyne’s independent auditors must attest to and report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of teradyne’s internal controls over financial reporting this requirement will first apply to teradyne’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending december 31 2004 although teradyne intends to diligently and vigorously review its internal controls over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section 404 requirements if teradyne’s independent auditors are not satisfied with teradyne’s internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented designed operated or reviewed or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements rules andor regulations differently from teradyne then they may decline to attest to management’s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of teradyne’s financial statements which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of teradyne’s shares 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

  

concentration of credit risk 

  

financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments forward currency contracts and accounts receivable teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities rated aa or higher which have minimal credit risk teradyne places forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 

  

exchange rate risk management 

  

teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in european and japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year these contracts are used to reduce teradyne’s risk associated with exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures teradyne does not engage in currency speculation 

  

at december 31 2003 and 2002 the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy us dollars to hedge those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies was 59 million and 119 million respectively a 10 fluctuation in exchange rates for 2003 and 2002 currencies would change the fair value by approximately 08 million and 12 million respectively however since these contracts hedge nonus currency assets and liabilities any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of these assets and liabilities being hedged the hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at december 31 2003 and 2002 and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 

  

interest rate risk management 

  

teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates investments with interest rate risk include short and longterm marketable securities debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages 

  

in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10 fluctuation in interest rates was assumed since the notes were “outof themoney” at year end they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored on this basis the potential loss on the fair value of debt was not material at december 31 2003 and was 94 million at december 31 2002 market risk for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio on this basis the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is 23 million and 25 million as of december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

almost every consumer electronics product from small appliances to automotive
engine controllers these devices are produced in enormous quantities the
lowest cost of test at very high production throughput rates is essential to
meeting the economic requirements in these markets teradynes j750 test
systems combine compact packaging high throughput and ease of production
test this was possible due to the high level of integration in the design a
single circuit board in the j750 test system provides up to 64 digital
inputoutput channels this innovative approach eliminated the traditional
mainframe creating a tester in the test head its zero footprint design
reduces the total cost of ownership and allows for more efficient use of
production floor space the j750 platform technology was used to create
teradynes ip750 image sensor test system the ip750 is focused on testing
current and future image sensor devices used in digital cameras and other

and instrument flexibility of the catalyst flex introduced in april of 2002
employs a unique soc tester per pin architecture bringing a higher degree of
parallelism to mixed signal and soc testing by testing more functions and more
devices at the same time in parallel flex increases the production
efficiency of mixed signal device testing the core of flex design employs a
universal slot concept which provides the user the flexibility to install
any instrument or tester resource into any of the tester slots flex is
similar to the j750 in that the instrumentation tends to be implemented on self
contained circuit boards that plug into the test head this modular design and
the universal slot architecture adds a level of adaptability and flexibility to
production testing which is new to the industry flex covers a range of devices
in the consumer electronics area including automotive higher performance
microcontrollers and power control flex will be expanded to cover wireless
and other integrated mixed signal device areas over time flex currently covers

applications engineering expertise at every step in the process by working
early with customers in the system design cycle this expertise helps balance
critical cost and performance needs in addition connection systems program
management services become an extension of the customers operation delivering
quick turn prototypes and high technology production volumes

circuit board test and inspection solutions

   the central element of almost every electronic product is a printed circuit
board assembly a circuit board assembly includes all the components and their
interconnections that cause the board to perform its intended functions as
more and more product functionality is packed into smaller packages such as
personnel digital assistants pdas phone handsets and laptop computers both
the circuit boards and their components become increasingly complex the
circuit board assembly manufacturing process is also complex and demands a
number of test and inspection steps teradyne circuit board assembly test and
inspection equipment is used throughout the manufacturing process to ensure
high production yields to maintain overall product quality to diagnose faults
quickly where and when they occur and to reduce total manufacturing cost the
teradyne circuit board assembly and inspection product range includes the
following products

incircuit test

   incircuit test systems examine the assembled and soldered printed circuit
board for proper construction under both poweroff and poweron conditions
defective components and solder joints are identified quickly and precisely
high throughput relatively low cost fault identification and diagnostic
accuracy are valued features which cause incircuit testers to be used
universally in every electronics production line teradyne incircuit products
support a full range of circuit board test applications including highvolume
production selective or sample test prototype testing and final or system
test accordingly teradyne offers a wide variety of capabilities and options
with its spectrum 8000series z1800series and gr teststation product lines

imaging inspection

   as circuit boards become increasingly dense and complex achieving the
electrical contact required for the traditional incircuit test method is
becoming more difficult timeconsuming and expensive loss of electrical
access is a primary driver behind the increasing popularity of imaging
inspection systems which examine the circuit board for physical qualities
including correct component presence and orientation the absence of electrical
opens and solder quality teradynes imaging inspection systems employ one of
two technologies automated optical inspection aoi whereby a visual image
of the board is captured and analyzed and automated xray inspection axi
which captures an xray image of the board each technology has particular
strengths in analyzing various board defect classes for example aoi is the
preferred technology for evaluating and diagnosing componentrelated defects
while axi is the preferred technology for analyzing hidden solderrelated
defects teradynes optima 7000series aoi systems employ advanced and patented
lighting camera software and mechanics resulting in highly reliable
repeatable and accurate optical inspection at high line speeds the axi
product line offers fast throughput with high resolution on both its
twodimensional 2d and threedimensional 3d models and is the only product
line that includes a combined 2d3d capability

repairable component on a replaceable unit teradyne has recently begun to
exploit architectural components that allow the repackaging of our solutions
into smaller lighter ruggedized implementations enabling teradyne to expand
our served markets to include the intermediate and operational areas of the
military market the requirements here are to isolate failures down to the
smallest replaceable unit in a mobile harsh environment the failed unit is
then passed back to the depot or factory for further diagnosis down to the
repairable component before being cycled back into stock in the commercial
aerospace market teradyne utilizes the same functional test and diagnostics
capabilities that apply to the military markets to test the increasing complex
electronic functions found in todays aircraft

      controls on funds transfer
      currency fluctuations
      difficulties in managing distributors
      potentially adverse tax consequences and
      accounts receivable collection

   teradyne attempts to reduce the effects of currency fluctuations by hedging
those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities
denominated in nonfunctional currencies and by conducting some of its
international transactions in us dollars or dollar equivalents see also
item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks and
note g financial instruments in notes to consolidated financial statements

competition

   teradyne faces substantial competition throughout the world in each of its
operating segments some of these competitors have substantial financial and
other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and
distribution of their products teradyne also faces competition from internal
suppliers at several of its customers some of teradynes competitors have
introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics
that may be considered equal or superior to those teradyne currently offers
teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of
their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that
provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product
introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market
acceptance of teradynes products moreover increased competitive pressure
could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially
adversely affect teradynes business financial condition and results of
operations

backlog

   at december 31 2002 and 2001 teradynes backlog of unfilled orders in each
of its four principal operating segments was as follows



                                                      in millions

                                                      4409 7630


   the decrease in semiconductor test systems and connection systems backlog of
772 million and 2534 million respectively was primarily due to customer
cancellations and demand reductions of the backlog at december 31 2002
approximately 93 of the semiconductor test systems backlog 99 of the
connection systems backlog 94 of circuit board test and inspection systems
backlog and 92 of the other test systems backlog is expected to be delivered
in 2003 generally teradynes backlog policy requires delivery of products and
services within twelve months except for service agreements where delivery may
cover a continuous period of up to thirtysix months

   customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and
without significant notice subject to possible cancellation penalties due to
possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders
teradynes backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the
actual sales for any succeeding period delays in delivery schedules andor
cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material
adverse effect on teradynes business and results of operations

raw materials

   teradynes products require a wide variety of electronic and mechanical
components from 4000 suppliers of which 55 represent 80 of the spending
teradyne can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of
certain items additionally teradyne could experience a temporary adverse
impact if any of its sole source suppliers ceased to deliver products
approximately 30 of material purchases require some custom work where having
multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive any prolonged inability to obtain
adequate supplies or any other circumstances that would require teradyne to
seek alternative sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on its
business financial condition and results of operations

patents and licenses

   teradynes development of its products both hardware and software is based
in significant part on proprietary information and technology teradyne
protects its rights in proprietary information and technology through various
methods such as

      patents and patent applications
      copyrights
      trademarks
      trade secrets
      business practices
      software license agreements nondisclosure agreements and other
       contracts and
      employee agreements

   however these protections might not be effective in all circumstances
competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit
teradynes proprietary technology andor information in countries where
teradyne lacks enforceable intellectual property rights ip or enforcement of
such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent also
ip protections can be invalidated through legal processes while teradyne does
not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary
rights is essential to its business if a significant portion of teradynes
intellectual property or proprietary rights is invalidated or ineffective
teradynes business could be materially affected

employees

   as of december 31 2002 teradyne employed approximately 7200 people since
the inception of teradynes business there have been no work stoppages or
other labor disturbances teradyne has no collective bargaining contracts

engineering and development activities

   the highly technical nature of teradynes products requires a large and
continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development
expenditures were approximately 2939 million in 2002 2873 million in 2001
and 3480 million in 2000 these expenditures amounted to approximately 24 of
consolidated net sales in 2002 20 in 2001 and 11 in 2000

environmental affairs

   teradyne is subject to various federal state and local government laws and
regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the
environment teradyne accrues for all known environmental liabilities when it
becomes probable that teradyne will incur cleanup costs and those costs can
reasonably be estimated the amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the
preliminary stages of investigation estimated environmental costs are not
expected to materially affect the financial position or results of teradynes
operations in future periods however estimates of future costs are subject to
change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation
laws and regulations

   in 2001 teradyne was designated as a potentially responsible party
prp at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arises out of
teradynes acquisition of perception laminates inc in august 2000 prior to
that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco
industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july 30 1992 neither
teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at the los
angeles site teradyne has asked the state of california to drop the prp
designation but california has not yet agreed to do so management does not
believe the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on
teradynes financial position or results of operations but there can be no
assurance that any such outcome would not have a material adverse effect on
teradynes financial position or results of operations

   in august 2002 teradyne was designated as a prp at a site in whittier
california teradyne was identified as a prp based on shipments from its
woodland hills california and agoura hills california sites during 1983 and
1984 based upon review of the shipping documents teradyne believes that any
potential liability is limited to that of a de minimus contributor to the site
management does not believe that any potential liability for the cleanup of
this site will have a material adverse effect on teradynes financial position
or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any potential
liability would not have a material adverse effect on teradynes financial
position or results of operations

item 3  legal proceedings

   after the august 2000 acquisition of herco technology corp and perception
laminates inc the former owners of those companies filed a complaint on
september 5 2001 against teradyne and two of its executive officers the case
is now pending in federal district court san diego california teradyne and
the two individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in its
entirety the court granted the motion in part and the only remaining claims
were that the sale of teradynes common stock to the former owners violated
certain california securities statutes and common law and that teradyne
breached certain contractual obligations in the agreements relating to the
acquisitions teradynes subsequent motion for partial summary judgment with
respect to the breach of contract claims was granted on november 7 2002 the
plaintiffs have asked the court to reconsider its ruling or alternatively for
leave to appeal both the dismissal of claims and summary judgment rulings to
the ninth circuit court of appeals teradyne has opposed these motions no
ruling has yet been issued other than the above described motions only a
small portion of the original complaint relating to alleged fraud in connection
with setting the transaction price remains pending before the district court
teradyne has answered and denied all liability management does not believe
that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on
teradynes financial position or results of operations but there can be no
assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on
teradynes financial position or results of operations

   also arising out of the august 2000 acquisition of herco technology corp
and perception laminates inc is a demand for arbitration made on or about
october 19 2001 by the former owners of those companies which was filed with
the american arbitration association the arbitration is with respect to
environmental indemnification claims initially asserted by teradyne under the
respective acquisition agreements these claims arose in connection with
environmental matters related to herco technology corp and perception
laminates inc facilities in california the arbitration demand by the former
owners seeks release of certain shares of teradynes common stock being held in
escrow pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreements and damages related
to failure to release the escrow teradyne has counterclaimed for enforcement
of the environmental indemnity provisions of the acquisition agreements
hearings in connection with the arbitration have been completed and the parties
are currently completing posthearing briefs for submission to the arbitrators
management does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a
material adverse effect on teradynes financial position or results of
operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a
material adverse effect on teradynes financial position or results of
operations

   teradyne and two of its executive officers were named as defendants in three
purported class action complaints that were filed in federal district court
boston massachusetts in october and november 2001 the court consolidated the
cases and has appointed three lead plaintiffs on november 8 2002 plaintiffs
filed and served a consolidated amended class action complaint the complaint
alleges among other things that the defendants violated sections 10b and
20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 by making during the period from
july 14 2000 until october 17 2000 material misrepresentations and omissions
to the investing public regarding teradynes business operations and future
prospects the complaint seeks unspecified damages including compensatory
damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs teradyne filed a
motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint on february 7 2003
teradynes motion has not yet been heard claims asserted in this case are
similar to the claims asserted in the case discussed above which is pending in
the federal district court in san diego california teradyne believes it has
meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend itself vigorously
management does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a
material adverse effect on teradynes financial position or results of
operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a
material adverse effect on teradynes financial position or results of
operations

   by letter dated october 22 2002 counsel for electro mechanical solutions
inc and several affiliated debtors including precismetals in chapter 11
bankruptcy cases pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern
district of california collectively the debtors asserted that teradyne
received payments in 2001 totaling 124 million from precismetals in the 90
days prior to the bankruptcy filing and that those

                                      14

payments constitute avoidable preferential transfers teradyne believes that it
has good faith defenses to the alleged preferential transfers and intends to
contest the claims vigorously management does not believe that the outcome of
these claims will have a material adverse effect on teradynes financial
position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such
claims would not have a material adverse effect on teradynes financial
position or results of operations

   in october 1998 a former employee of genrad inc which teradyne acquired
on october 26 2001 instituted an arbitration proceeding against genrad
alleging breach of his severance agreement teradyne believes that the
employees claims are without merit the last arbitration hearing was conducted
on october 28 2002 and a decision is expected by may 2003 management does
not believe that the outcome of this proceeding will have a material adverse
effect on teradynes financial position or results of operations but there can
be no assurance that the outcome would not have a material adverse effect on
teradynes financial position or results of operations

   teradyne has also been designated as a potentially responsible party prp
with respect to environmental cleanup matters at two sites in california see
the discussion of these items in item 1 environmental matters above

   teradyne disputes all of the claims above and believes they are without
merit and intends to defend vigorously against them however an adverse
resolution of any of the claims could have a material adverse effect on
teradynes financial position or results of operations teradyne is not
presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to any
of the claims and therefore as of december 31 2002 had not accrued for any
potential losses from the claims

   in addition teradyne is subject to legal proceedings claims and
investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business such as but not
limited to patent commercial and environmental matters there are no such
matters pending that teradyne expects to be material to its business financial
position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such
matters would not have a material adverse effect on teradynes business
financial position or results of operations

   teradyne has never paid cash dividends because it has been teradynes policy
to use earnings to finance expansion and growth payment of future cash
dividends will rest within the discretion of the board of directors and will
depend among other things upon teradynes earnings capital requirements and
financial condition teradyne presently expects to retain all of its earnings
for use in the business

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations

   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report
on form 10k in addition to the historical information contained in this
document the discussion in this annual report on form 10k contains
forwardlooking statements made pursuant to the private securities litigation
reform act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of
teradynes plans expectations and intentions the cautionary statements made
in this annual report on form 10k should be read as being applicable to all
related forwardlooking statements whenever they appear in this annual report
on form 10k teradynes actual results could differ materially from the
results contemplated by these and any other forwardlooking statements factors
that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well
as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in certain factors
that may affect future results and elsewhere herein

critical accounting policies and estimates

   teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to
understanding its business and its results of operations the impact and any
associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is
discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations where such policies affect its reported and
expected financial results

preparation of financial statements and use of estimates

   the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires teradyne to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
liabilities on an ongoing basis teradyne evaluates its estimates including
those related to inventories investments goodwill intangible and other
longlived assets bad debts income taxes pensions warranties

                                      16

contingencies and litigation teradyne bases its estimates on historical
experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions

revenue recognition

   teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an
arrangement title and risk of loss have passed delivery has occurred or the
services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured it is teradynes
policy to require an arrangement with its customers either in the form of a
written or electronic contract or purchase order containing all of the terms
and conditions governing the arrangement prior to the recognition of revenue
title and risk of loss generally passes to the customer at the time of delivery
of the product to a common carrier at the time of the transaction teradyne
assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based upon the
payment terms of the arrangement if a significant portion of the sales price
is not due within normal payment terms the sales price may not be deemed fixed
and revenue would be recognized as the amounts become due teradyne does not
offer a right of return on its products

   teradyne assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including
past transaction and collection history with a customer and the
creditworthiness of the customer teradyne performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers financial condition but generally does not
require collateral from its customers if teradyne determines that
collectibility of the sales price is not reasonably assured revenue is
deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured which is
generally upon receipt of payment from the customer

   revenue is recognized upon delivery provided that customer acceptance
criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment where the criteria cannot be
demonstrated prior to shipment or in the case of new products revenue is
deferred until acceptance has been received for multiple element arrangements
teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of
the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the
undelivered elements are delivered teradyne also defers the portion of the
sales price that is not due until acceptance which represents deferred profit
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately in order
to recognize revenue the functionality of the undelivered elements must not be
essential to the delivered elements installation is not considered essential
to the functionality of the product as these services do not alter the product
capabilities do not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed
by the customers or other vendors in addition to installation other elements
may include extended warranties customer support and undelivered products

evaluate all inventory for net realizable value teradyne records a provision
for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through
the quarterly review process the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions
about future demand product mix and possible alternative uses

income taxes

   on a quarterly basis teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred
tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance as a result of its
review undertaken at december 31 2002 teradyne concluded under applicable
accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax
assets would not be realized and established a full valuation allowance until
an appropriate level of profitability is reached teradyne does not expect to
recognize tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations

goodwill intangible and longlived assets

   teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived
assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable factors teradyne considers important
in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance
relative to expected historical or projected future operating results
significant changes in the manner of teradynes use of the acquired asset a
change in the strategy for teradynes overall business and significant negative
industry or economic trends when teradyne determines that the carrying value
of intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the
existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment teradyne
measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using
a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks teradyne assesses
goodwill for impairment at least annually on a reporting basis or more
frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded
goodwill may be impaired if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its
fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying
amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair
value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess

allowance for doubtful accounts

   the volatility of the industries that teradyne serves can cause certain of
its customers to experience shortages of cash flows which can impact their
ability to make required payments teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to
make required payments estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed
periodically taking into account the customers current payment history the
customers current financial statements and other information regarding the
customers credit worthiness if the financial condition of teradynes
customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments additional allowances may be required

results of operations

2002 compared to 2001

business overview

   teradyne saw an encouraging start to 2002 as first quarter sales were up
13 over the fourth quarter of 2001 followed by 25 quarter to quarter growth
in the second quarter net sales growth slowed to 7 in the third quarter
followed by flat quarter to quarter performance in the fourth quarter the
combination of a continued weak economy weak demand for technology products
and the uncertain world political environment overwhelmed the recovery that
appeared to be starting early in the year

   as of the end of 2002 teradynes customers in general have lowered their
inventory levels and reduced their overall cost structures resulting in
improved quarterly financial performance additionally utilization of
teradynes semiconductor test equipment and semiconductor test equipment in
general has increased over the last year this has resulted from increased
volumes of units shipped by teradynes semiconductor industry customers these
are generally signs of potential increases in demand for teradynes products
however a number of teradynes customers continue to lose money although at a
reduced rate in the semiconductor industry this is occurring as decreased
unit prices have offset the unit volume gains as a result teradynes
customers continue to defer orders until the last possible moment until
teradynes customers see significant and sustained increases in their business
levels both in units and dollars teradynes orders could remain low or see a
further decline if teradyne sees further declines in its own order rates the
amount of teradynes inventory and certain longlived assets considered
realizable could be significantly reduced

   net orders increased 12 to 9053 million in 2002 from 8082 million in
2001 net orders increased by 63 and 65 in semiconductor test systems and
circuit board test and inspection systems respectively connection systems net
orders decreased by 61 the increase in semiconductor orders was driven by
increased demand for soc products by teradynes integrated device manufacturers
idms and subcon customers primarily for use in asian facilities the
increase in orders for circuit board test and inspection largely resulted from
the full year impact of the genrad acquisition the decrease in connection
system orders reflects the impact of cancellations which are described in the
next paragraph other test systems net orders increased 286 mostly due to the
addition of a full year of activity from diagnostic solutions that was part of
the genrad acquisition

   teradyne experienced cancellations of 1590 million and 2855 million
during 2002 and 2001 respectively for 2002 cancellations of 53 million and
105 million occurred in the semiconductor test systems and connection system
businesses respectively the semiconductor test systems cancellations were
largely for orders that were booked in late 2000 and early 2001 by subcons in
anticipation of further increases in their own demand cancellations in the
connection systems business were from major customers in the telecommunication
and information technology infrastructure industries as their own demand
levels dropped

   teradynes net orders for its four principal operating segments for 2002 and
2001 were as follows

2301 million in 2002 from 2069 million in 2001 service revenue is derived
from the servicing of teradynes installed base of products and includes
maintenance contracts customer support extended warranties and parts sales
semiconductor test systems sales decreased 22 to 5576 million in 2002 from
7177 million in 2001 connection systems sales decreased 27 to 3970
million in 2002 from 5408 million in 2001 and circuit board test and
inspection systems sales increased 29 to 1708 million in 2002 from 1324
million in 2001 other test systems sales increased 95 to 969 million in
2002 from 497 million in 2001 year to year increases in sales for teradynes
circuit board test and inspection systems and other test systems largely
resulted from the full year impact of the acquisition of genrad during the
fourth quarter of 2001

   of the decrease in semiconductor test system sales 987 million was due to
the accounting impact of the implementation of sab 101 which is further
described in the next paragraph the connection systems business saw downward
pricing pressure during 2002 as the average selling prices declined by
approximately 15 due to price pressures from both customers and competitors in
the face of a weak economy additionally year to year results for teradynes
semiconductor and connection systems businesses were impacted by 2001s steady
decline in quarterly sales which was followed by a recovery to approximately
the current runrate levels in the first half of 2002 the relatively stronger
first half of 2001 which followed teradynes record sales year of 2000
further contributed to annual results for 2001 that exceeded 2002 for these
businesses

   during the fourth quarter of 2000 teradyne implemented staff accounting
bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101
retroactive to the beginning of the year included in 2001 sales was 987
million related to shipments of customer orders in 2000 where title was
retained by teradyne until customer payment in order to perfect a security
interest teradyne no longer retains title until customer payment

   in 2002 and 2001 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of
consolidated net sales in 2002 and 2001 teradynes three largest customers
accounted for 23 and 24 of consolidated net sales respectively

gross margin

   gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 190 in 2002 from
194 in 2001 the decrease in the gross margin rate in 2002 compared to 2001
was affected by the following items



                                                                                           rate

      this accounting change impacted 2001 as described above

   during the year ended december 31 2002 an excess and obsolete inventory
provision of 390 million was recorded in cost of sales of which 207 million
related to the lack of demand for the probeone product and the discontinuance
of the j996 product after a last time buy offer to teradynes customers
additionally due to consolidating and downsizing of manufacturing locations
approximately 57 million of incremental accelerated depreciation was
classified in cost of sales

   during 2001 teradyne recorded a provision of 1397 million for excess and
obsolete inventory including discontinued product lines the total inventory
provision for excess and obsolete inventory excluding the discontinued product
lines was 1052 million in 2001 and was principally due to the sharp decline
in incoming semiconductor test systems and connection systems orders during
the third quarter of 2001 teradyne recorded a charge of 323 million related
to an inventory writedown for the discontinuance of its flash 750 memory
product

engineering and development

   engineering and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to
24 in 2002 from 20 in 2001 with spending increasing by 66 million the
increase in spending was primarily due to the additional expense base resulting
from teradynes purchase of genrad in the fourth quarter of 2001 which
increased spending by approximately 230 million and to a lesser extent the
granting of the prior years previously frozen salary increases during the
third quarter of 2002 which increased spending by approximately 60 million
the additional engineering and development expense was partially offset by
reductions in discretionary spending across all of teradynes engineering
groups which decreased spending by approximately 232 million as described in
the gross margin section above teradyne recorded a charge for incremental
accelerated depreciation of 08 million which is classified in engineering and
development

selling and administrative

   selling and administrative expenses increased to 24 of sales in 2002 from
19 of sales in 2001 with spending increasing by 203 million the increase
in spending was principally due to additional expenses resulting from
teradynes purchase of genrad in the fourth quarter of 2001 with an additional
increase coming from the granting of the prior years previously frozen salary
increases during the third quarter of 2002 the additional selling and
administrative expense was partially offset by workforce reductions and
reductions in discretionary spending as described in the gross margin section
above teradyne recorded a charge for incremental accelerated depreciation of
11 million which is classified in selling and administrative

   during the year ended december 31 2002 teradyne recorded 862 million in
goodwill and intangibles impairment charges sfas 142 provides that goodwill of
a reporting unit be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual
tests in certain circumstances including a significant adverse change in the
business outlook during the third quarter of 2002 as a result of significant
change in the business outlook teradyne tested the goodwill related to the
circuit board test and inspection systems segment for impairment as of
september 29 2002 teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets
and liabilities associated with the circuit board test and inspection systems
segment exceeded its fair value in the third quarter of 2002 teradyne
recognized a 785 million goodwill impairment charge the impairment charge
was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated
with the circuit board test and inspection systems segment to its carrying
value the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present
value of future cash flows

   during the year ended december 31 2002 teradynes management concluded in
accordance with sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of
longlived assets that certain longlived assets held for sale were impaired
as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets
and recorded charges of 697 million the charge for the connection systems
segment included 256 million

loss income before taxes

   loss income before income taxes was a loss of 5609 million in 2002
compared to a loss of 3262 million in 2001 semiconductor test systems
connection systems and circuit board test and inspection systems loss before
income taxes increased 181 million 566 million and 1589 million
respectively in 2002 due to decreased sales in semiconductor test systems and
connection systems goodwill and intangible asset impairments in circuit board
test and inspection systems and the market conditions described above other
test systems income before income taxes increased 47 million due to the
addition of diagnostics solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the
genrad acquisition

income taxes

   for the year ended december 31 2002 teradyne recorded a tax provision of
1575 million resulting in a tax rate of 28 the tax rate of 28 is primarily
due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a full
valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets as a result of its review
undertaken at december 31 2002 teradyne concluded under applicable accounting
criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would
not be realized until an appropriate level of profitability is reached
teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of
operations

   the effective tax rate benefit for the year ended 2001 was 38 teradynes
effective tax rate for the year ended 2001 primarily reflects the us
statutory income tax rate the net effect of state taxes and the effect of tax
benefits from its ireland manufacturing operations tax exemptions relating to
ireland operations are effective through 2010

revenue

   product sales decreased 56 in 2001 to 12337 million from 28289
million in 2000 service revenue declined slightly in 2001 to 2069 million
from 2151 million in 2000 as the overall business declined semiconductor
test systems sales decreased 65 to 7177 million in 2001 from 20443
million in 2000 connection systems sales decreased 26 to 5408 million in
2001 from 7346 million in 2000 and circuit board test and inspection systems
sales decreased 6 to 1324 million in 2001 from 1412 million in 2000
these decreases reflect the overall economic and industry market conditions
described below circuit board test and inspection systems sales include the
twomonth impact of the genrad acquisition which contributed sales of 190
million other test systems sales decreased 60 to 497 million in 2001 from
1241 million in 2000 which principally reflects the divestiture of software
test systems at the end of 2000 as well as the overall economic and industry
market conditions described below during the fourth quarter of 2000 teradyne
implemented staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial
statements sab 101 retroactive to the beginning of the year included in

   teradynes business has been adversely impacted by the slowdown in economies
worldwide including the effects of the hostilities begun in september 2001
teradyne has also been adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the
electronics and semiconductor industries which experience recurring periods of
oversupply of products and equipment of the type teradyne sells these factors
have resulted in a downturn in the demand for teradynes products during 2001
orders declined significantly across all of teradynes product lines when
compared with the orders teradyne received during 2000

   in 2001 and 2000 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of
consolidated net sales in 2001 teradynes three largest customers accounted
for 24 of consolidated net sales

gross margin

   gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 194 in 2001 from
472 in 2000 the percentage decrease in 2001 was attributable to the
decreased utilization of teradynes manufacturing capacity as sales volume
decreased while certain components of costs of sales remained fixed and
additional inventory provisions the decrease in the percentage of gross margin
was also impacted to a lesser extent by increased competitive price pressure as
current semiconductor products mature and the mix of teradynes business
changes as connection systems and circuit board test and inspection system
sales which have lower gross margins become a larger percentage of teradynes
business

   inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory was 1052 million in
2001 which excludes the inventory writedowns for product line discontinuance
compared to 275 million in 2000 included in cost of sales the increase in
the inventory provision was caused by the worldwide economic slowdown during
2001 between 2000 and 2001 orders declined by approximately 25127 million
a 76 decrease this drop in orders combined with lead time requirements for
inventory procurement and teradynes new product introduction plans
necessitated additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory during 2001
teradyne recorded an inventory writedown in semiconductor test systems due to
the discontinuance of the flash 750 product line of 323 million

engineering and development

   engineering and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to
20 in 2001 from 11 in 2000 with spending decreasing by 607 million this
spending decrease was primarily due to lower prototype material costs and the
impact of workforce reductions salary cuts and furloughs in semiconductor
test systems and circuit board test and inspection systems excluding the
impact of the genrad acquisition connection systems engineering and
development spending increased 5 from 2000 to 2001

selling and administrative

   selling and administrative expenses increased to 19 of sales in 2001 from
12 of sales in 2000 with spending decreasing by 1077 million the decrease
in spending was principally due to certain cost containment programs such as
workforce reductions salary cuts and furloughs

restructuring and other charges

   restructuring and other charges include a workforce reduction and early
retirement provision of 373 million a charge of 154 million for certain
impaired manufacturing assets at connection systems a charge for a connection
systems impaired facility of 120 million a charge for impaired assets of
79 million relating to the discontinuance of the flash 750 product line in
semiconductor test systems and a charge for vacated space under certain
operating leases of 17 million in circuit board test and inspection systems
there were approximately 2900 employees terminated in 2001 across all
functional groups all severance benefits for employees terminated in 2001 were
paid by the fourth quarter of 2002

certain factors that may affect future results

   from time to time information provided by teradyne statements made by its
employees or information included in its filings with the securities and
exchange commission including this form 10k contain statements that are not
purely historical but are forward looking statements made under section 21e
of the securities exchange act of 1934 which involve risks and uncertainties
in particular forward looking statements made herein include projections
plans and objectives for teradynes business financial condition operating
results future operations or future economic performance statements relating
to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital requirements capital
expenditures expectations as to customer orders and demand for teradynes
products and statements relating to backlog bookings and cancellations gross
margins and pricing considerations these statements are neither promises nor
guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties both known and unknown which
could cause teradynes actual future results to differ materially from those
stated in any forward looking statements factors that may cause such
differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below these
factors and others are discussed from time to time in teradynes filings with
the securities and exchange commission

teradynes business is impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide

   teradynes business has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the
global economies that began in the second half of 2000 the uncertainty
regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies have caused companies to
reduce capital investments and may cause further reduction of such investments
these reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and
semiconductor industry which teradyne serves and have contributed to teradyne
incurring losses teradyne cannot predict if or when the growth rate of
worldwide economies will rebound whether the growth rate of its business will
rebound when the worldwide economies begin to grow or if or when teradyne will
return to profitability the effects of the economic decline are being felt
across all of teradynes business segments and continue to result in
significantly reduced customer orders

current geopolitical turmoil and the continuing threat of domestic and
international terrorist attacks may adversely impact teradynes revenues

   international turmoil exacerbated by the war in iraq and the escalating
tensions in north korea have contributed to an uncertain political and economic
climate both in the united states and globally which may affect teradynes
ability to generate revenue on a predictable basis in addition recent
terrorist attacks internationally and the threat of future terrorist attacks
both domestically and internationally have negatively impacted an already
weakened worldwide economy as teradyne sells products both in the united
states and internationally the threat of future terrorist attacks may
adversely affect teradynes business these conditions make it difficult for
teradyne and it customers to accurately forecast and plan future business
activities and could have a material adverse effect on teradynes business
financial condition and results of operations

                                      35

teradynes business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for
electronics

   teradynes business and results of operations depend in significant part
upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other
electronics which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market
demand for those products the current and anticipated market demand for
electronics has been impacted by the economic slowdown that began in the latter
portions of 2000 and the effects of the hostilities begun in september 2001
historically the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly
cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply which often have had a severe
negative effect on demand for test equipment including systems manufactured
and marketed by teradyne teradyne believes that the markets for newer
generations of electronic products such as those that teradyne manufactures and
markets will also be subject to similar fluctuations teradyne is dependent on
the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous
customer orders could have an adverse effect on its results of operations
teradyne cannot assure that the continued slump in new orders will turn around
in the future or that any increase in sales or new orders for a calendar year
will be sustained in subsequent years in addition any factor adversely
affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the
electronics industry may adversely affect teradynes business financial
condition and operating results

teradyne has taken and expects to continue to take measures to address the
current slowdown in the market for its products which could have longterm
negative effects on teradynes business

   teradyne has taken and expects to continue to take measures to address the
current slowdown in the market for its products in particular teradyne has
reduced its workforce closed facilities reduced the pay of certain employees
implemented furloughs discontinued certain of its product lines implemented
material cost reduction programs reduced its planned capital expenditures and
expense budgets these measures have reduced
expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled
customer orders however each measure teradyne has taken and any additional
measures taken in the future to contain expenditures could have longterm
negative effects on teradynes business by reducing its pool of technical
talent decreasing or slowing improvements in its products increasing
teradynes debt and making it more difficult for teradyne to respond to
customers or competitors

teradynes business may be adversely impacted by acquisitions which may affect
its ability to manage and maintain its business

   since teradynes inception it has acquired a number of businesses in the
future teradyne may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that
complement its existing operations such past or future acquisitions could
involve a number of risks including

      the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel
      the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into
       teradynes culture product and service delivery methodology and other
       standards controls procedures and policies
      the inability to retain the management key personnel and other
       employees of an acquired business
      the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business
      the possibility that teradynes reputation will be adversely affected by
       customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business
      potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired
       business including but not limited to regulatory environmental and tax
       liabilities
      the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles which may
       adversely affect teradynes reported results of operations and
      litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with
       such acquisitions

   for example in connection with the august 2000 acquisition of each of herco
technology corp a california company and perception laminates inc a
california company a complaint was filed on or about september 5 2001 and is
now pending in federal district court san diego california by the former
owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of its
executive officers this case is further described in item 3 legal
proceedings in this form 10k

                                      36

page

   additionally in 2001 teradyne was designated as a potentially responsible
party prp at a cleanup site in los angeles california this claim arises
out of teradynes acquisition of perception laminates inc in august 2000
prior to that date perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of
alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july 30 1992
neither teradyne nor perception laminates have ever conducted any operations at
the los angeles site teradyne has asked the state of california to drop the
prp designation but california has not yet agreed to do so this case is
further described in item 1 business under environmental affairs in this
form 10k

   in addition to the foregoing any acquired business could significantly
underperform relative to teradynes expectations

teradyne currently faces and in the future may be the subject of securities
class action litigation due to past or future stock price volatility

   teradyne and two of its executive officers were named as defendants in three
purported class action complaints that were filed in federal district court
boston massachusetts in october and november 2001 the court consolidated the
cases and has appointed three lead plaintiffs on november 8 2002 plaintiffs
filed and served a consolidated amended class action complaint the complaint
alleges among other things that the defendants violated sections 10b and
20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 by making during the period from
july 14 2000 until october 17 2000 material misrepresentations and omissions
to the investing public regarding teradynes business operations and future
prospects the complaint seeks unspecified damages including compensatory
damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs teradyne filed a
motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint on february 7 2003
teradynes motion has not yet been heard claims asserted in this case are
similar to the claims asserted in the case discussed in item 3 legal
proceedings which is pending in the federal district court in san diego
california teradyne believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and
will defend itself vigorously management does not believe that the outcome of
these claims will have a material adverse effect on teradynes financial
position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such
claims would not have a material adverse effect on teradynes financial
position or results of operations

teradynes business may be adversely impacted by divestitures of lines of
business which may affect its ability to manage and maintain its business

   since teradynes inception it has divested itself of certain lines of
business in the future teradyne may undertake additional such divestitures
such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks including

      the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel
      disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of
       business on teradynes culture product and service delivery methodology
       and other standards controls procedures and policies
      customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of
       business and
      the decreased diversification of teradynes product lines caused by the
       divestiture of a line of business which may make teradynes operating
       results subject to increased market fluctuations

if teradyne is unable to protect its intellectual property teradyne may lose a
valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect its rights

   teradynes products incorporate technology that it protects in several ways
including patents copyrights and trade secrets while teradyne believes that
its patents copyrights and trade secrets have value in general no single one
is in itself essential at times teradyne has been notified that it may be in
violation of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement
against teradyne if successful could have a material adverse effect on its
ability to sell its products or could require a lengthy and expensive defense
which could adversely affect its operating results

                                      37

if teradyne fails to develop new technologies to adapt to its customers needs
and if its customers fail to accept its new products teradynes revenues will
be adversely affected

   teradyne believes that its technological position depends primarily on the
technical competence and creative ability of its engineers teradynes
development of new technologies commercialization of those technologies into
products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is
critical to teradynes success successful product development and introduction
depends upon a number of factors including

      new product selection
      development of competitive products by competitors
      timely and efficient completion of product design
      timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and
      assembly processes and product performance at customer locations

teradyne is subject to intense competition

   teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its
operating segments some of teradynes competitors have substantial financial
and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and
distribution of their products teradyne also faces competition from internal
suppliers at several of its customers some of teradynes competitors have
introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics
which may be considered equal or superior to those teradyne currently offers
teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of
their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that
provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics new product
introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market
acceptance of teradynes products moreover increased competitive pressure
could lead to intensified price based competition which could materially
adversely affect teradynes business financial condition and results of
operations

teradyne is subject to risks of operating internationally

   teradyne derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers
outside the united states teradynes international sales are subject to
significant risks and difficulties including

      unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy
       changes affecting international markets
      compliance with customs regulations
      changes in tariffs and exchange rates
      political and economic instability acts of terrorism and international
       conflicts
      difficulties in accounts receivable collection
      difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and
      potentially adverse tax consequences such as the world trade
       organizations dispute against the us foreign sales credit

teradynes business may suffer if it is unable to attract and retain key
employees

   competition for certain employees with skills required by teradyne is
intense in the high technology industry teradynes success will depend on its
ability to attract and retain key technical employees in this business segment
the loss of one or more key or other employees teradynes inability to attract
additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each
have a material adverse effect on teradynes business results of operations or
financial condition

                                      38

if teradynes suppliers do not meet teradynes product or delivery
requirements teradyne could have reduced revenues and earnings

   the availability of certain components including semiconductor chips may
be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the
inability of some vendors to consistently meet teradynes quality or delivery
requirements if any of teradynes suppliers were to cancel contracts or
commitments with teradyne or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements
needed to satisfy customer orders for teradynes products teradyne could lose
timesensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly
revenues and earnings which would have a material adverse effect on teradynes
business results of operations and financial condition in addition teradyne
relies upon thirdparty contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in
its products and teradynes ability to meet customer orders for those products
depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these
subcontractors over whom teradyne does not exercise any control

teradyne may incur significant liabilities if it fails to comply with
environmental regulations

   teradyne is subject to environmental regulations and statutory strict
liability relating to the use storage discharge site cleanup and disposal
of hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes if teradyne fails
to comply with present and future regulations or is required to perform site
remediation teradyne could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension
of production present and future regulations may also

      restrict teradynes ability to expand its facilities
      require teradyne to acquire costly equipment or
      require teradyne to incur other significant costs and expenses

teradyne has substantially increased its indebtedness

   on october 24 2001 teradyne completed a private placement of 400 million
principal amount of 375 convertible senior notes the notes due 2006 and
received net proceeds of 389 million on december 19 2001 teradyne obtained
a loan of approximately 45 million in the form of a 75 mortgage loan
maturing on january 1 2007 the mortgage as a result teradyne has
incurred approximately 445 million principal amount of additional
indebtedness substantially increasing its ratio of debt to total
capitalization the level of teradynes indebtedness among other things could

      make it difficult for teradyne to make payments on its debt and other
       obligations
      make it difficult for teradyne to obtain any necessary future financing
       for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or
       other purposes
      require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from
       operations to service for indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of
       cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures
      limit teradynes flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in
       its business and the industries in which teradyne competes
      place teradyne at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to
       less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to
       capital resources and
      make teradyne more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in its
       business

there can be no assurance that teradyne will be able to meet its debt service
obligations including its obligations under the notes and the mortgage

teradyne may not be able to satisfy certain obligations in the event of a
change in control

   the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a change
in control of teradyne if a change in control as defined in the indenture is
triggered teradyne may be required to offer to purchase the notes with cash
if teradyne has to make that offer teradyne cannot be sure that it will have
enough funds to pay for all the notes that the holders could tender

                                      39

page

   in the event of a change in control of teradyne the mortgage lender may
elect to declare all amounts due under the mortgage to be immediately due and
payable and may elect to take possession of or sell the property subject to
the mortgage

teradyne may not be able to pay its debt and other obligations

   if teradynes cash flow is inadequate to meet its obligations teradyne
could face substantial liquidity problems if teradyne sustains continued
losses or is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds
necessary to make required payments on the notes the mortgage or certain of
its other obligations teradyne would be in default under the terms thereof
which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their
maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness teradyne may
incur any such default could have a material adverse effect on teradynes
business prospects financial position and operating results in addition
teradyne cannot assure that it would be able to repay amounts due in respect of
the notes or the mortgage if payment of those obligations were to be
accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined
in the instruments creating those obligations moreover teradyne cannot assure
that it will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to
pay the principal amount due on the notes or the mortgage at their respective
maturities

teradyne may need additional financing which could be difficult to obtain

   teradyne expects that its existing cash and marketable securities cash
generated from operations the proceeds of the notes offering in october 2001
and the proceeds from the mortgage financing in december 2001 will be
sufficient to meet teradynes cash requirements to fund operations and expected
capital expenditures for the next twentyfour months however teradyne has a
finite amount of cash and in the event teradyne may need to raise additional
funds due to ongoing losses or other reasons teradyne cannot be certain that
it will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms if at
all particularly in light of teradynes continued quarterly losses further
if teradyne issues additional equity securities stockholders may experience
additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences
or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock future
financings may place restrictions on how teradyne operates its business if
teradyne cannot raise funds on acceptable terms if and when needed teradyne
may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services take advantage
of future opportunities grow its business or respond to competitive pressures
which could seriously harm teradynes business

if teradyne is required to account for options under its employee stock plans
as a compensation expense teradynes compensation expense would be increased

   there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting
treatment for employee stock options teradyne currently discloses pro forma
compensation expense quarterly by calculating the grants fair value and
disclosing the impact on net loss earnings and net loss earnings per share
in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements it is possible that
future laws and regulations will require teradyne to record the fair value of
all stock options as compensation expense in its consolidated statement of
operations note b accounting policies of the consolidated financial
statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would
have had on teradynes net loss income and loss earnings per share if it
had been in effect during the past three years also included in item 7
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations teradyne has included stockbased compensation disclosures that
exceed current disclosure requirements

provisions of teradynes charter and bylaws and massachusetts law make a
takeover of teradyne more difficult

   teradynes basic corporate documents its stockholder rights plan and
massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a
change in the control of teradyne even if a change of control might be
regarded as beneficial to some or all of teradynes stockholders

teradynes operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly

   teradynes quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide
variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and
profitability including

      competitive pressures on selling prices
      the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of orders
       previously received
      provisions for excess and obsolete inventory
      charges for certain longlived assets including goodwill
      changes in product mix
      teradynes ability to introduce new products and technologies on a
       timely basis
      the introduction of products and technologies by teradynes competitors
      market acceptance of teradynes and its competitors products
      fulfilling backlog on a timely basis
      reliance on sole source suppliers
      potential retrofit costs
      the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter and
      the timing of investments in engineering and development

   in particular due to teradynes introduction of a number of new complex
test systems in 2001 and 2002 there can be no assurance that teradyne will not
experience delays in shipment of its products or that its products will achieve
customer acceptance

   as a result of the foregoing and other factors teradyne has and may
continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a
quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its
business financial condition operating results and stock price



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks

concentration of credit risk

   financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash investments forward currency
contracts and accounts receivable teradyne maintains cash investments
primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt
securities rated aa or higher which have minimal credit risk teradyne places
forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in
order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with
respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of
geographically dispersed customers teradyne performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require
collateral to secure accounts receivable

exchange rate risk management

   teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in european and japanese
currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position forward currency
contracts generally have maturities of less than one year these contracts are
used to reduce teradynes risk associated with exchange rate movements as
gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and
gains on underlying exposures teradyne does not engage in currency speculation

   at december 31 2002 and 2001 the face amount of outstanding forward
currency contracts to buy us dollars to hedge those currency exposures
associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional
currencies was 119 million and 110 million respectively a 10 fluctuation
in exchange rates for 2002 and 2001 currencies would change the fair value by
approximately 12 million and 13 million

                                      41

page

respectively however since these contracts hedge nonus currency assets and
liabilities any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by
opposite changes in the underlying value of these assets and liabilities being
hedged the hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value
of the forward currency contracts at december 31 2002 and comparing that with
those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates

interest rate risk management

   teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates the
principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates
investments with interest rate risk include short and longterm marketable
securities debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible
debt and mortgages

   in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk a 10
fluctuation in interest rates was assumed since the convertible debt was
outof themoney at year end it was treated as a fixed rate debt security
and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at
maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored market risk
for the short and longterm marketable securities was estimated as the
potential decrease in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in
interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio on this
basis the potential loss in fair value from changes in interest rates is 69
million and 71 million as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the
potential loss reflects a fair value loss on debt offset by a fair value gain
on investments teradyne expects to hold its debt to maturity or conversion
whichever is sooner therefore the realization of the potential loss on the
debt obligations is unlikely

sales and distribution

     teradynes systems are complex and require extensive support both by the
customer and teradyne prices for teradynes systems can reach 4 million or
more in 2000 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated
net sales in 2000 teradynes three largest customers accounted for 21 of
consolidated net sales

     we have sales and service offices throughout north america south east
asia europe taiwan japan and korea as teradynes customers outside the
united states are located primarily in those geographic areas teradyne sells in
these areas predominantly utilizing a direct sales force substantially all of
our manufacturing activities are conducted in the united states sales to
customers outside the united states accounted for 54 of consolidated net sales
in 2000 52 in 1999 and 46 in 1998

     teradyne is subject to the inherent risks involved in international trade
such as

         political and economic instability
         restrictive trade policies
         controls on funds transfer
         currency fluctuations
         difficulties in managing distributors
         potentially adverse tax consequences and
         the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable collection

     teradyne attempts to reduce the effects of currency fluctuations by hedging
part of its exposed position and by conducting some of its international
transactions in us dollars or dollar equivalents see also item 7a
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks

competition

     we face substantial competition throughout the world in each of our
operating segments some of these competitors have substantial financial and
other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution
of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers at several
of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or announced new
products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal
or superior to those we currently offer we expect our competitors to continue
to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new
products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and
performance characteristics new product introductions by competitors could
cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products moreover
increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based
competition which could materially adversely affect our business financial
condition and results of operations

backlog

     at december 31 2000 and 1999 teradynes backlog of unfilled orders was as
follows



                                                        in millions

     of the backlog at december 31 2000 approximately 98 of the semiconductor
test systems backlog 100 of the connection systems backlog and approximately
83 of the other test and inspection systems backlog are expected to be
delivered in 2001 teradynes experience indicates that a portion of orders
included in the backlog may be canceled or rescheduled we have recently
experienced the rescheduling of delivery dates by some of our customers and
thus the timing of the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog is
uncertain there are no seasonal factors related to the backlog

raw materials

     our products require a wide variety of electronic and mechanical
components teradyne can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely
delivery of certain items additionally we could experience a temporary adverse
impact if any of our sole source suppliers ceased to deliver products any
prolonged inability to obtain adequate yields or deliveries or any other
circumstances that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply could
have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results
of operations

patents and licenses

     the development of products by teradyne both hardware and software is
largely based on proprietary information we protect our rights in proprietary
information through various methods such as

         copyrights
         trademarks
         patents and patent applications
         software license agreements and
         employee agreements

     any invalidation of teradynes intellectual property rights could have a
material adverse effect on our business

employees

     as of december 31 2000 we employed approximately 10200 people since the
inception of teradynes business there have been no work stoppages or other
labor disturbances teradyne has no collective bargaining contracts

engineering and development activities

     the highly technical nature of teradynes products requires a large and
continuing engineering and development effort engineering and development
expenditures for new and improved products were approximately 3009 million in
2000 2286 million in 1999 and 1952 million in 1998 these expenditures
amounted to approximately 10 of consolidated net sales in 2000 and 13 in 1999
and 1998

environmental affairs

     teradynes manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and
regulations designed to protect the environment particularly from manufacturing
plant wastes and emissions these laws include

         the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability
          act
         the superfund amendment and reauthorization act of 1986
         the occupational safety and health act
         the clean air act
         the clean water act
         the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 and
         the hazardous and solid waste amendments of 1984

in the opinion of management the costs associated with complying with these
laws and regulations have not had and are currently not expected to have a
material effect upon the financial position of teradyne

     teradyne has never paid cash dividends because it has been its policy to
use earnings to finance expansion and growth payment of future cash dividends
will rest within the discretion of the board of directors and will depend among
other things upon teradynes earnings capital requirements and financial
condition teradyne presently expects to retain all of its earnings for use in
the business



item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

     in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission issued staff
accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab
101 sab 101 summarizes certain areas of the staffs views in applying
generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial
statements historically teradyne recognized revenue from the sales of products
upon shipment provided that risk of loss had passed to the customer and
accrued for the costs of installation under the new accounting method adopted
retroactive to january 1 2000 teradyne recognizes revenue from the sales of
products when both title and risk of loss pass to the customer teradyne also
defers the greater of the fair value or the contractual holdback of any
undelivered elements such as installation services until the undelivered
elements are delivered teradyne previously accounted for contractual acceptance
terms based upon probable achievement of meeting the acceptance criteria
teradyne now accounts for acceptance terms based upon whether such contractual
acceptance criteria is objectively demonstrated prior to shipment during the
fourth quarter of 2000 teradyne implemented the secs sab 101 guidelines
retroactive to the beginning of the year this was reported as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle as of january 1 2000 the net impact
for fiscal year 2000 of the adoption of sab 101 on sales including the amounts
deferred at december 31 2000 which previously would have been recognized prior
to sab 101 was not material the results for the first three quarters of fiscal
year ending december 31 2000 have been restated in accordance with sab 101 pro
forma amounts for the periods beginning before january 1 2000 have not been
presented as the effect of the change in accounting principle could not be
reasonably determined

results of operations

  2000 compared to 1999

     sales increased 70 in 2000 to a record 30439 million from 17909
million in 1999 semiconductor test systems shipments increased by 69 due to
increased sales to semiconductor manufacturers and subcontractors as these
customers increased capacity to meet their customers requirements sales of
connection systems to unaffiliated customers grew 97 as a result of significant
growth in demand from networking data storage and other high technology
customers other test and inspection systems sales increased 28 from 1999 with
increases in circuitboard test and inspection systems of 19 broadband test
systems of 10 and software test systems of 64 due to the sale of a majority
interest in the software test business in december 2000 software test systems
revenue will not be reflected on an ongoing basis

     as described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations  certain factors that may affect future
results our business is impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide we
are further affected by the cyclical nature of the electronics and semiconductor
industry with recurring periods of over supply these factors have resulted in a
downturn in the demand for our products teradyne does not have visibility as to
the length or severity of the downturn during this period we expect a decline
in orders and are anticipating a reduction in sales from the fourth quarter 2000
level consequently teradyne is taking appropriate actions to bring expenses in
line with the economic conditions

     income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle increased 4658 million from 2738 million in 1999 to 7396 million
in 2000 semiconductor test systems connection systems and other test and
inspection systems income before income taxes increased 3874 million 918
million and 165 million respectively in 2000 due to increased sales in each
group

     incoming orders increased 52 from 21906 million in 1999 to a record
33209 million in 2000 orders increased in all operating segments and were
led by a 159 increase in connection systems orders semiconductor test systems
orders increased 24 broadband test systems orders increased 77 and circuit
board test and inspection systems and software test systems increased 26 and
70 respectively teradynes backlog increased 41 to a record 13821
million

     costs of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from 59 of sales in 1999
to 55 of sales in 2000 the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the
increased utilization of teradynes manufacturing overhead as sales volume
increased while certain components of cost of sales remained fixed

     engineering and development expenses decreased from 13 of sales in 1999 to
10 of sales in 2000 even though spending increased 724 million the increase
in spending was primarily due to new product development expenses in
semiconductor test systems and to a lesser extent increased expenses related
to product development in connection systems circuitboard test and inspection
systems and software test systems

     selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from
14 in 1999 to 12 in 2000 spending increased by 1062 million year over year
in support of increased semiconductor test systems connection systems and
software test systems sales

     interest and other income increased 134 million to 307 million in 2000
compared to 1999 interest income increased due to an increase in teradynes
average invested balances and higher interest rates included in interest and
other income is a gain relating to the divestiture of the software test
business expenses related to the divestiture are included in selling and
administrative expense these elements offset and the transaction results in an
immaterial impact to the financial statements

     teradynes effective tax rate was 30 in 2000 and 1999 teradyne continued
to utilize export sales corporation benefits and other tax benefits to operate
below the us statutory rate of 35

  1999 compared to 1998

     sales increased 20 in 1999 to 17909 million from 14892 million in
1998 semiconductor test systems shipments increased by 25 due to increased
orders resulting from capacity expansion at semiconductor manufacturers and
subcontractors sales of connection systems to unaffiliated customers grew 39
as a result of continued growth in demand from networking data storage and
other high technology customers other test and inspection systems sales were
down 18 from 1998 with decreases in broadband test systems of 45 and
circuitboard test and inspection systems of 20 these decreases were a result
of telecommunication customers reducing investment in traditional voice testing
technology and circuitboard test and inspection systems customers seeking lower
cost solutions andor new solutions to test increasingly complex circuit
boards other test and inspection systems sales decreases were offset slightly
by an increase of 42 in sales of software test systems to customers within the
telecommunication and webbased application development markets

     net income grew 896 million to 1917 million in 1999 from 1021 million
in 1998 income before income taxes increased 1279 million from 1459 million
in 1998 to 2738 million in 1999 semiconductor test systems and connection
systems income before income taxes increased 1834 million and 292 million
respectively in 1999 due to increased sales other test and inspection systems
income before income taxes decreased 465 million in 1999 resulting in a loss
before income taxes of 143 million in 1999 this decrease in income before
income taxes was due to decreased sales coupled with teradyne maintaining its
engineering and development of new products

     incoming orders increased 82 from 12065 million in 1998 to a record
21906 million in 1999 orders increased in nearly all operating segments and
were led by a 130 increase in semiconductor test systems orders connection
systems and software test systems orders both increased 34 and circuitboard
test and inspection systems orders increased by a modest 4 orders for
broadband test systems decreased 59 in 1999 as a result of record bookings
teradynes backlog increased 69 to a record 9795 million

     costs of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from 64 of sales in 1998
to 59 of sales in 1999 included in cost of sales in 1998 was a 230 million
charge for excess inventory the charge resulted from the drop in demand for
semiconductor test systems products excluding this charge cost of sales
decreased from 62 to 59 the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to
the increased utilization of teradynes manufacturing overhead as sales volume
increased while certain components of cost of sales remained fixed

     engineering and development expenses were 13 of sales in both 1999 and
1998 representing a year over year increase of 334 million the increase was
primarily due to new product development expenses in semiconductor test systems
although there were increased expenses related to product development in each of
teradynes operating segments

     selling and administrative expenses were 14 of sales in both 1999 and 1998
representing a year over year increase of 435 million the increase was due to
higher compensation related expenses and spending in support of increased
semiconductor test systems

     interest income increased 38 million to 173 million in 1999 compared to
1998 due to an increase in teradynes average invested balances

     teradynes effective tax rate was 30 in 1999 and 1998 teradyne utilized
export sales corporation benefits and certain research and development tax
credits to operate below the us statutory rate of 35

liquidity and capital resources

     teradynes cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance
increased 770 million in 2000 to 4644 million teradyne has generated cash
from operating activities in each of the last three years and has used that cash
to fund operations net income adjusted to exclude the effects of noncash
items provided cash of 5002 million in 2000 2783 million in 1999 and
1860 million 1998 accounts receivable increased 38 in 2000 primarily as a
result of increased shipment volume in the fourth quarter of 2000 compared to
the fourth quarter of 1999 inventories increased 88 in 2000 to support
teradynes backlog commitment these

                                        10
page   12

increases were partially offset by an increase of 67 in accounts payable and
other accruals in total other than those assets and liabilities resulting from
investing and financing activities the cash effect of changes in operating
assets and liabilities was a 294 million use in 2000 a 891 million source
in 1999 and a 526 million source in 1998

     teradyne used 3123 million of cash for investing activities in 2000
2448 million in 1999 and 1016 million in 1998 investing activities consist
of purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities and purchases of
capital assets to support longterm growth capital expenditures increased by
1470 million in 2000 compared with 1999 primarily in semiconductor test
systems and connection systems segments this was due to capacity expansion in
land buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment capital
expenditures were 2982 million in 2000 1512 million in 1999 and 1644
million in 1998

     teradyne used 975 million of cash for financing activities in 2000
1268 million in 1999 and 262 million in 1998 financing activities include
sales and repurchases of teradynes common stock as well as repayments of debt
during 2000 1999 and 1998 net common stock activity used 922 million 1255
million and 246 million of cash respectively since 1996 teradyne has used
5408 million of cash to repurchase 200 million shares of its common stock on
the open market

     teradynes available revolving credit line of 1200 million expired on
january 31 2001 at expiration of the revolver any amounts outstanding are
converted into a two year term note as of december 31 2000 and 1999 no
amounts were outstanding under this agreement the revolving credit line was not
renewed in 2001 teradyne believes its cash cash equivalents and marketable
securities balance of 4644 million together with other sources of funds
including cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to meet
working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future

     inflation has not had a significant longterm impact on earnings

recently issued accounting pronouncements

     in june 1999 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 137
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  deferral of the
effective date of fasb statement no 133 sfas no 137 amends sfas no 133
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which was issued
in june 1998 and was to be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years
beginning after june 15 1999 sfas no 137 defers the effective date of sfas
no 133 to the first quarter of all fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000
teradyne will implement sfas no 133 as amended in 2001 and does not expect any
material impact on its financial position or results of operations



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks

concentration of credit risk

     financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash investments forward currency
contracts and accounts receivable teradyne maintains cash investments
primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt
securities rated aa or higher which have minimal credit risk teradyne places
forward currency contracts with high creditquality financial institutions in
order to minimize credit risk exposure concentrations of credit risk with
respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of
geographically dispersed customers

exchange rate risk management

     teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in european and japanese
currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position and firm commitments
teradynes firm commitments consist of certain orders received in currencies
other than us dollars forward currency contracts generally have maturities of
less than one year these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with
exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to
offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures teradyne does not
engage in currency speculation

                                        11
page   13

     at december 31 2000 the face amount of outstanding forward currency
contracts to buy us dollars for non us currencies was 730 million a 10
fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value
by approximately 73 million however since these contracts hedge non us
currency transactions any change in the fair value of the contracts would be
offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of the transactions being
hedged the hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of
the forward currency contracts at december 31 2000 and comparing that with
those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates

interest rate risk management

     due to its shortterm duration the fair value of teradynes cash and
investment portfolio at december 31 2000 approximated carrying value market
risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a
hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates for issues contained in the
investment portfolio the resulting hypothetical fair value was not materially
different from the yearend carrying value

certain factors that may affect future results

     from time to time information provided by teradyne statements made by its
employees or information included in its filings with the securities and
exchange commission including this form 10k and teradynes annual report to
shareholders may contain statements which are not historical facts socalled
forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties in
particular statements in item 1 business relating to teradynes delivery
time of unfilled orders and in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations relating to the sufficiency of
capital to meet working capital and planned capital expenditures may be forward
looking statements teradynes actual future results may differ significantly
from those stated in any forward looking statements factors that may cause such
differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below each
of these factors and others are discussed from time to time in teradynes
filings with the securities and exchange commission

our business is impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide

     our business is dependent on current and anticipated market demand for
electronics which has been impacted by the slowdown in the economies of the
united states asia and elsewhere that began in the latter portions of 2000
while our diverse businesses may allow us to perform better than some companies
in periods of economic decline there is no guarantee that this will be the case
currently

our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics

     our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon
capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics
which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those
products the electronic and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical
with recurring periods of over supply which often have had a severe effect on
demand for test equipment including systems manufactured and marketed by us we
believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products will also
be subject to similar fluctuations we are dependent on the timing of customer
orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could impact
our results of operations we cannot assure that any future increase in sales or
bookings for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters in
addition any factor adversely affecting the electronic industry or particular
segments within the electronic industry may adversely affect our business
financial condition and operating results

we have taken and expect to continue to take remedial measures to address the
recent slowdown in the market for our products which could have longterm
effects on our business

     we have taken and expect to continue to take remedial measures to address
the recent slowdown in the market for our products in particular we have
reduced our workforce frozen hiring delayed salary increases reduced senior
managers pay implemented furloughs and reduced our planned capital
expenditures and expense budgets these measures will reduce our expenses in the
face of decreased revenues due to decreased

                                        12
page   14

or cancelled customer orders however each of these measures could have
longterm effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent
decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and making it more difficult
for us to respond to customers

if we are not able to meet our customers delivery requirements it would have
an adverse effect on our results of operations

     we typically maintain a large multiweek order backlog if we are unable to
fill these orders and meet customer delivery expectations customers may cancel
existing orders or fail to place new orders in the future which would have an
adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations factors that affect
our ability to meet customer delivery expectations include

         the availability of expanded manufacturing facilities
         our ability to attract and retain qualified manufacturing personnel to
          meet anticipated manufacturing levels
         the difficulties inherent in manufacturing highly complex products
          that have only recently been introduced and
         the availability of components including semiconductor chips which
          may be in short supply from time to time

     in addition we rely upon thirdparty contract manufacturers for certain
subsystems used in our products and our ability to meet customer orders for
those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by
these subcontractors over whom we do not exercise any control

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may lose a valuable
asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights

     our products incorporate technology that we protect in several ways
including patents copyrights and trade secrets while we believe that our
patents copyrights and trade secrets have value in general no single one is
in itself essential at times we have been notified that we may be in violation
of patents held by others an assertion of patent infringement against us if
successful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our
products or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely
affect our operating results

if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers needs and if
our customers fail to accept our new products it will adversely affect our
revenues

     we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the
technical competence and creative ability of our engineers our development of
new technologies commercialization of those technologies into products and
market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to our
success successful product development and introduction depends upon a number
of factors including

         new product selection
         development of competitive products by competitors
         timely and efficient completion of product design and
         timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly
          processes and product performance at customer locations

intense competition in our industry may affect our revenues

     we face substantial competition throughout the world in each of our
operating segments some of these competitors also have substantial financial
and other resources to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and
distribution of their products we also face competition from internal suppliers
at several of our customers some of our competitors have introduced or
announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be
considered equal or superior to those we currently offer we expect our
competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and
to introduce new products or

                                        13
page   15

new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance
characteristics new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline
in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products moreover increased
competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition which
could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results
of operations

we are subject to risks of operating internationally

     we derive a significant portion of our total revenue from customers outside
the united states our international sales are subject to significant risks and
difficulties including

         unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy
          changes affecting our markets
         changes in tariffs and exchange rates
         political and economic instability
         difficulties in accounts receivable collection
         difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and
         potentially adverse tax consequences

our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly

     our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety
of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability
including

         competitive pressures on selling prices
         the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of
          orders previously received
         changes in product mix
         our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely
          basis
         introduction of products and technologies by our competitors
         market acceptance of our and our competitors products
         fulfilling backlog on a timely basis
         reliance on sole source suppliers
         potential retrofit costs
         the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter and
         the timing of investments in engineering and development

     as a result of the foregoing and other factors we have and may continue to
experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or
annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial
condition operating results and stock price
