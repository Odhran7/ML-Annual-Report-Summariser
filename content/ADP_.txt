competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on product and service quality reputation ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of offerings and price we believe that we are competitive in each of these areas and that our leadingedge technology together with our commitment to service excellence distinguishes us from our competitors 

industry regulation 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them we have and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs 

as one of the world’s largest providers of hcm solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients employees of our clients vendors and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy data protection and cybersecurityrelated laws including federal state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both client employee data and our own employee data the changing nature of these comprehensive laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the european union’s the “eu” general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which will be replaced by the voterapproved california privacy rights act of 2020 the “cpra” impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients the gdpr imposes strict and comprehensive requirements on us as both a data controller and a data processor as part of our overall data protection compliance program including with respect to data protection laws in the eu we are one of the few companies in the world to have implemented binding corporate rules “bcrs” compliance with our bcrs permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in accordance with the gdpr and other data protection laws in the eu the ccpa and cpra require companies to provide new data disclosure access deletion and optout rights to consumers in california in addition in the united states the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 applies to our insurance services businesses and adp totalsource 

as part of our payroll and payroll tax management services we move client funds to taxing authorities our clients’ employees and other payees via electronic transfer direct deposit prepaid access and adpcheck in 2019 the office of the comptroller of currency the “occ” authorized us to open adp trust company national association the “adp trust bank” via a national trust bank charter pursuant to the national bank act the adp trust bank is the sole trustee of adp client trust our grantor trust which holds us client funds and is responsible for the oversight and management of those client funds the adp trust bank and all of its fiduciary activities including the us money movement it oversees and manages via adp client trust is subject to comprehensive ongoing oversight and regulation by the occ we have surrendered all state money transmitter licenses as the activity previously managed through those licenses was moved into the adp client trust managed by adp trust bank which is federally exempt from state money transmitter regulation with respect to the client money movement activity that it manages in addition our us money movement managed by the adp trust bank and our us prepaid access offering are subject to the antimoney laundering and reporting provisions of the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 the “bsa” elements of our money 

movement activities outside of the united states are subject to licensing and similar antimoney laundering and reporting laws and requirements in certain countries in which we provide such services our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the fair credit reporting act adp totalsource is subject to various state licensing requirements and maintains certifications with the internal revenue service because adp totalsource is a coemployer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees we may be subject to limited obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax insurance and employment laws our registered investment adviser provides certain investment management and advisory services to retirement plan administrators under a heightened “fiduciary” standard and is regulated by the sec and the us department of labor adp brokerdealer inc which supports our retirement services business is a registered brokerdealer regulated by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority finra 

in addition many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to adp changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations products and services for example our payroll services are designed to facilitate compliance with state laws and regulations applicable to the payment of wages in addition our hcm solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the affordable care act in the united states similarly our tax credit services business which helps clients in the united states take advantage of tax credit opportunities in connection with the hiring of new employees and certain other activities is based on federal state or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits which are subject to renewal amendment or rescission 

we believe that key components of our compliance programs provide real competitive differentiators for instance our bcrs have enabled adp to apply a global standard of data protection simplifying data transfer processes and assisting our clients in meeting the demanding standards of data protection expected in europe – a solution that most competitors cannot provide similarly the adp client trust and adp trust bank provide client funds with a level of protection that most competitors cannot offer we continue to expand our approach to compliance and are adopting “compliance by design” as a tenet that prioritizes compliance in designing and developing new solutions to support our clients

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k see item 1 business—competition of this form 10k for a discussion of the competitive environment in the markets in which we operate many risks affect more than one category and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories the risks described below are not the only risks we face and the occurrence of any of the following risks or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or reputation 

legal and compliance risks 

failure to comply with or changes in laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the laws and regulations described in the “industry regulation” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could cause us to incur substantial costs or could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines and lawsuits including class actions that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

in addition changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be 

withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities changes in us or foreign tax laws regulations or rulings or the interpretation thereof could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws or interpretations thereof that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business in addition changes in the manner in which health and welfare plans sponsored by peos or the totalsource health and welfare plan in particular are regulated could adversely impact the demand for our peo offering our wisely offerings and potentially other future offerings in the payments andor consumer space may subject us to additional laws and regulations some of which may not be uniform and may require us to modify or restrict our offerings and decrease our potential revenue and earnings 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations economic and trade sanctions antimoney laundering laws and regulations and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

regulators worldwide continue to exercise a high level of scrutiny with respect to anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations such scrutiny has resulted in aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and burdensome regulations any of which could materially adversely impact our business we operate our business around the world including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties and in some cases to other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations among others in addition some of our businesses and entities in the us and a number of other countries in which we operate are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including for example the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 the “bsa” among other things the bsa requires certain financial institutions 

including banks and money services businesses such as national trust banks and providers of prepaid access like us to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records we have registered our payroll card business as a provider of prepaid access and registered our adp trust bank with the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network fincen 

we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations and we regularly review upgrade and enhance our policies and procedures however there can be no assurance that our employees consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators any violations of applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition further bank regulators including the occ which regulates the adp trust bank continue to impose additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses as a class to be higher risk customers for money laundering as a result our banking partners that assist in processing our money movement transactions may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional material requirements on us these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal riskbased policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us may require us to materially change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

failure to comply with privacy data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

the collection storage hosting transfer processing disclosure use security and retention and destruction of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal state and foreign privacy data protection and cyber security laws these laws which are not uniform generally do one or more of the following regulate the collection storage hosting transfer including in some cases the transfer outside the country of collection processing disclosure use security and 

retention and destruction of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information and regulate the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing under certain circumstances some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals clients data protection authorities andor other regulators in the event of a data breach in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries the european union the “eu” general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and state consumer privacy laws like the california consumer protection act the “ccpa” which will be replaced by the voterapproved california privacy rights act of 2020 the “cpra” are among the most comprehensive of these laws and more and more jurisdictions are adopting similarly comprehensive laws that impose new data privacy protection requirements and restrictions as part of our overall data protection compliance program in connection with the gdpr we implemented binding corporate rules “bcrs” as both a data processor and data controller which permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with eu data protection laws 

we believe that providing insights from data including artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml will become increasingly important to the value that our solutions and services deliver to our customers however the ability to provide datadriven insights may be constrained by current or future regulatory requirements or ethical considerations including our own published guiding ethical principles regarding ai and ml that could restrict or impose burdensome and costly requirements on our ability to leverage data in innovative ways 

complying with privacy data protection and cyber security laws and requirements including the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr our bcrs and the ccpa and cpra may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices further enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability and damage our reputation in addition data security events and concerns about privacy abuses by other companies are changing consumer and social expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection as a result even the perception of noncompliance whether or not valid may damage our reputation 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

our ability to compete and our success depend in part upon our intellectual property we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees customers vendors partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights we may need to devote significant resources including cybersecurity resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights in addition the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or ineffective or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by third parties or our personnel litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and timeconsuming furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights which may be successful 

we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights which could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

there is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry third parties including our competitors may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our products or services and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing upon such rights even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and if successfully asserted against us or if we decide to settle could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments obtain licenses modify applications prevent us from offering our services or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers vendors or partners in connection with any such claim or litigation even if we were to prevail in such a dispute any litigation could be costly and timeconsuming 

security and technology risks 

our businesses collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and retain and dispose of personal and business information and collect hold and transmit client funds and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation increase our costs cause losses and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with our business we collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and retain and dispose of large amounts of personal and business information about our clients employees of our clients our vendors and our employees contractors and temporary staff including payroll information health care information personal and business financial data social security numbers and their foreign equivalents bank account numbers tax information and other sensitive personal and business information we also collect significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients and transmit them to their employees taxing authorities and other third parties 

we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and client funds and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes nonetheless the global environment continues to grow increasingly hostile as attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics code and viruses certain of these malicious parties may be statesponsored andor supported by significant financial and technological resources although this is a global problem it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent parties including our personnel may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and retain and dispose of and the client funds that we collect and transmit 

we have programs and processes in place to prevent detect and respond to data or cybersecurity incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures our ability to address data or cybersecurity incidents may also depend on the timing and nature of assistance that may be provided from relevant governmental or law enforcement agencies hardware software applications or services that we develop or procure from third parties or are required by third parties such as foreign governments to install on our systems may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could or in respect of thirdparty software may be designed to compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data or our systems unauthorized parties also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our personnel including phishing and other social engineering techniques whereby attackers use enduser behaviors to distribute 

computer viruses and malware into our systems or otherwise compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data or our systems as these threats continue to evolve and increase we continue to invest significant resources and may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities in addition while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect confidential personal and business information we may not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients vendors or partners and in any event third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures information obtained by malevolent parties including our personnel resulting from successful attacks against our clients vendors partners or other third parties may in turn be used to attack our information technology systems 

any cyberattack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service corruption of data ransomware attack theft of nonpublic or other sensitive information or similar act by a malevolent party including our personnel or inadvertent acts or inactions by our vendors partners or personnel could result in the loss disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information or the theft of client or adp funds and could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations or that of our clients result in liability litigation regulatory investigations and sanctions or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider as the global environment continues to grow increasingly hostile the security of our operating environment is ever more important to our clients and potential clients as a result the breach or perceived breach of our security systems could result in a loss of confidence by our clients or potential clients and cause them to choose another service provider which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data or cybersecurity incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us a data or cyber security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation while adp maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of data and cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of data and cyber risk 

our systems applications solutions and services may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems we need to properly manage our systems applications and solutions and any upgrades enhancements and expansions we may undertake from time to time in order to ensure they properly support our businesses from time to time these systems applications or solutions fail to operate properly or become disabled any such failure or disablement even for a brief period of time whether due to malevolent acts errors defects or any other factors could result in financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans and procedures may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data or funds service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities in addition the severity of the failure or disablement may require us to replace or rebuild the affected systems applications or solutions and we may be unable to do so before it materially adversely affects our business 

a disruption of the data centers or cloudcomputing or other technology services or systems that we utilize could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

we host our applications and serve our clients with data centers that we operate and with data centers that are operated and cloudcomputing and other technology services and systems that are provided by thirdparty vendors these data centers or cloudcomputing and other technology services and systems have and in the future may failed become disabled or been disrupted any failure disablement or disruption even for a limited period of time could disrupt our businesses and we could suffer financial loss liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition in addition our thirdparty vendors may cease providing data center facilities or cloudcomputing or other technology services or systems elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition 

business and industry risks 

if we fail to upgrade enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may materially diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our technology solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish in addition investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in product development we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts before knowing to what extent our investments will result in products the market will accept in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to evaluate the new product offerings furthermore we may not execute successfully on our product development strategy including because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing and technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion 

we may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives which are designed to streamline our organization extend our worldclass distribution and strengthen our talent and culture while supporting our revenue growth margin improvement and productivity if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits improvements may be delayed not sustained or not realized and our business operations and competitive position could be adversely affected these initiatives or our failure to successfully manage them could result in unintended consequences or unforeseen costs including distraction of our management and employees attrition inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a major natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial 

condition and results of operations or have other adverse consequences 

our business financial condition results of operations access to capital markets and borrowing costs may be adversely affected by a major natural disaster or catastrophic event including civil unrest geopolitical instability war terrorist attack pandemics or other actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the covid19 outbreak or other events beyond our control and measures taken in response thereto 

the covid19 outbreak created and such other events may create significant volatility and uncertainty and economic and financial market disruption the extent of any such impact depends on developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the duration and scope of the event the governmental and business actions taken in response thereto actions taken by the company in response thereto and the related costs the impact on economic activity and employment levels the effect on our clients prospects suppliers and partners our ability to sell and provide our solutions and services including due to travel restrictions business and facility closures and employee remote working arrangements the ability of our clients or prospects to pay for our services and solutions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume in addition clients or prospects may delay decision making demand pricing and other concessions reduce the value or duration of their orders delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements our business is also impacted by employment levels across our clients as we have varied contracts throughout our business that blend base fees and peremployee fees the covid19 outbreak may have longterm effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working which may present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business 

political economic and social factors may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility a slowdown in the economy or other negative changes including in employment levels the level of interest rates or the level of inflation may have a negative impact on our businesses in addition as our operating costs increase due to inflationary pressure or otherwise we may not be able to offset these increases by corresponding price increases for our products and solutions clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on hcm services or renegotiating their contracts with us which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we invest our funds held for clients in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless such investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or together during periods of unusual financial market volatility 

in addition as part of our client funds investment strategy we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in order to satisfy these shortterm funding requirements we maintain access to various sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may increase our borrowing costs andor require us to sell availableforsale securities in our funds held for clients to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements when there is a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy the company may experience a decline in client fund obligations and may also sell availableforsale securities in our funds held for clients in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client fund obligations a sale of such availableforsale securities may result in the recognition of losses and reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients either or both of which may adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll tax and other money movement services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we publicly share certain information about our environmental social and governance “esg” initiatives we may face increased scrutiny related to our esg initiatives and any related targets including from the investment community in addition our ability to achieve certain esg initiatives and targets may depend on the actions or continuing requirements of governmental entities eg our paperless initiatives may depend on whether certain states continue to require employers to offer employees to be paid via paper check or to obtain 

employee consent to be paid electronically instead of via paper check our failure to achieve progress in these and other esg areas on a timely basis or at all could impact our reputation business including employee retention and growth 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us strong investmentgrade longterm debt ratings and high commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and adversely impact our results of operations 

our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others 

we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders responding to such actions could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our business and operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy including with respect to our esg efforts which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers vendors investors and other third parties in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is to an important degree dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated people reflecting diverse perspectives and the diversity of our communities and clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is increasingly intense making it more difficult and expensive to attract and retain highly skilled motivated and diverse personnel if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled motivated and diverse personnel results of our operations and culture may suffer

the primary components of “other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments including corporate functions costs related to our transformation office severance costs nonrecurring gains and losses the elimination of intercompany transactions and all other interest income and expense 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to our gaap results we use the adjusted results and other nongaap metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods 

we believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior periods and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance the nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations since these adjusted financial measures and other nongaap metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap they should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to their corresponding us gaap measures and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies 



a in adjusted ebit we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model the adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “all other interest expense” and “all other interest income” 

b in fiscal 2022 the charges include consulting costs relating to our company wide transformation initiatives partially offset by net reversals relating to severance and gain on sale of assets unlike other severance charges which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results these specific charges relate to actions taken as part of our broadbased companywide transformation initiative 

c the income tax provisionbenefit was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect for the year ended june 30 2022 

d the adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our adjusted net earnings plus our adjusted provision for income taxes 

the following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the nongaap measure of organic constant currency which excludes the impact of acquisitions the impact of dispositions and the impact of foreign currency the impact of acquisitions 

and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the oneyear anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the oneyear period preceding the transaction the impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year results using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year the peo segment is not impacted by acquisitions dispositions or foreign currency 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

as of june 30 2022 cash and cash equivalent s were 14 billion which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds 

for corporate liquidity we expect existing cash cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities cash flow from operations together with our 97 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both longterm and shortterm debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends share repurchases and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future our financial condition remains solid at june 30 2022 and we have sufficient liquidity 

for client funds liquidity we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our us shortterm commercial paper program and our us canadian and united kingdom shortterm reverse repurchase agreements together with our 97 billion of comm itted credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations please see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a further discussion of the risks related to our client funds extended investment strategy see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our shortterm financing including commercial paper 

operating investing and financing cash flow s 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows are summarized as follows 

net cash flows provided by operating activities was flat compared to prior year and includes a net unfavorable change in the components of operating assets and liabilities due to timing on collections of accounts receivable and an increase in incentive compensation payments offset by the growth in our underlying business net income adjusted for noncash adjustments as compared to the year ended june 30 2021  

net cash flows used in investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of 34556 million and higher payments related to acquisitions of intangibles and a business offset by proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment 

net cash flows provided by financing activities changed due to a net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of 87217 million which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients employees and other payees an increase in reverse repurchase agreements borrowing and the settlement of cash flow hedges in the year ended june 30 2021 these were partially offset by the issuance of debt in the year ended june 30 2021 and repurchases of common stock and dividends paid in fiscal 2022 

we purchased approximately 92 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share o f 21440 du ring fis cal 2022 as compared to purchases of 82 million shares at an average price per share of 17004 during fiscal 2021 from time to time the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things actual and potential acquisition activity cash balances and cash flows issuances due to employee benefit plan activity and market conditions 

capital resources and client fund obligations 

we have 30 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025 2028 and 2030 we may from time to time revisit the longt erm debt market to refinance existing debt finance investments including acquisitions for our growth and maintain the appropriate capital structure however there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our notes 

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securiti es this commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to 97 billion in aggregate maturity value  our c ommercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s prime1 “p1” by moody’s and f1 by fitch these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days at june 30 2022 and 2021 we had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows 



our us canadian and united kingdom shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an asneeded basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations at june 30 2022 and 2021 there were 1364 million and 235 million respectively of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows 



we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility we had a 375 billion 364day credit agree ment that was amended in june 2022 and matured in july 2022 on july 1 2022 the company entered into a new 375 billion 364day credit agreement that matures in june 2023 with a one year termout option to replace the maturing facility in addition we have a fiveyear 275 billion credit facility and a fiveyear 32 billion credit facility maturing in june 2024 and june 2026 respectively each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate com mitment can be increased by 500 million subject to the availability of additional commitments the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes if necessary we had no borrowings through june 30 2022 under the credit facilities we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the 97 billion a vailable to us under the revolving credit agreements see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our shortterm financing including credit facilities 

our investment portfolio does not contain any assetbacked securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages alternativea mortgages subprime auto loans or subprime home equity loans collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations credit default swaps derivatives auction rate securities structured investment vehicles or noninvestment grade fixedincome securities we own aaarated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan credit card equipment lease and rate reduction receivables secured predominantly by prime collateral all collateral on assetbacked securities is performing as expected through june 30 2022 in addition we own us government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by federal farm credit banks and federal home loan banks our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations see note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 were 1771 million as compared to 1783 million for fiscal 2021 we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 to be between 175 million and 200 million

in the normal course of business we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends share repurchases capital expenditures andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary objectives consistent with those objectives we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities in circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under o ur 97 billion commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s p1 by moody’s and f1 by fitch the highest possible shortterm credit ratings our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our 97 billion committe d credit facilities the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate canadian government agency and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbbrated securities is 5 years and for single a rated aarated and aaarated securities it is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

  

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rat e changes the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio decreased from 15 for fiscal 2021 to 13 for fiscal 2022 a hy pothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rate s of 25 basis points appl ied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approx imately an 18 million i mpact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2023 a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately an 8 million im pact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2023 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaarated and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s dbrs for canadian dollar denominated securities and fitch for assetbacked and commercialmortgagebacked securities in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us government and government agency canadian government and united kingdom government securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 recently issued accounting pronouncements of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and other comprehensive income we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies for additional information 

the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances these estimates require levels of subjectivity and judgment which could result in actual results differing from our estimates the company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates 

deferred costs  assets recognized from the costs to obtain and fulfill contracts 

description 

incremental costs of obtaining a contract eg sales commissions and cost incurred to implement clients on our solutions eg direct labor that are expected to be recovered are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the client retention period depending on the business unit 

judgments and uncertainties 

the company has estimated the amortization periods for deferred costs by using its historical retention rates by business unit to estimate the pattern during which the service transfers the expected client relationship period ranges from three to eight years 

sensitivity of estimate to change 

as the assumptions used to estimate the amortization period of the deferred costs could have a material impact on timing of recognition we assess the amortization periods annually using historical retention rates actual retention rates were not materially different than those used in our calculation to determine the amortization period we regularly review our deferred costs for impairment there were no impairment losses incurred during the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 june 30 2021 or june 30 2020 

goodwill 

description 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired 

judgments and uncertainties 

the company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2022 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using as appropriate the income approach which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and the market approach which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates profitability projections working capital assumptions the weighted average cost of capital the determination of appropriate market comparison companies and terminal growth rates several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences 

sensitivity of estimate to change 

some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including the weightedaverage cost of capital tax rates market comparisons and terminal growth rates while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units it is possible a material change could occur if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value it could result in material impairments of our goodwill the assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends macroeconomic conditions and projections consistent with the company’s operating strategy changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses 

we completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of june 30 2022 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill we performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values 

income taxes 

description 

judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

judgments and uncertainties

revenues we are a leader in each of our major service offerings and do not believe any of our major services or business units is subject to unique market risk 

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive we know of no reliable statistics by which we can determine the number of our competitors but we believe that we are one of the largest providers of hcm solutions in the world hcm solutions global solutions and hro solutions other than peo compete with other business outsourcing companies companies providing erp services providers of cloudbased hcm solutions and financial institutions our peo business competes with other peos providing similar services as well as business outsourcing companies companies providing erp services and providers of cloudbased hcm solutions other competitive factors include a company’s inhouse function whereby a company installs and operates its own hcm system 

competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on product and service quality reputation ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of offerings and price we believe that we are competitive in each of these areas and that our leadingedge technology together with our commitment to service excellence distinguishes us from our competitors 

industry regulation 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them we have and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs 

as one of the world’s largest providers of hcm solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients employees of our clients vendors and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy data protection and cybersecurityrelated laws including federal state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both client employee data and our own employee data the changing nature of these comprehensive laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the european union’s the “eu” general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which will be replaced by the voterapproved california privacy rights act of 2020 the “cpra” impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients the gdpr imposes strict and comprehensive requirements on us as both a data controller and a data processor as part of our overall data protection compliance program including with respect to data protection laws in the eu we are one of the few companies in the world to have implemented binding corporate rules “bcrs” compliance with our bcrs permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in accordance with the gdpr and other data protection laws in the eu the ccpa and cpra require companies to provide new data disclosure access deletion and optout rights to consumers in california in addition in the united states the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 applies to our insurance services businesses and adp totalsource 

as part of our payroll and payroll tax management services we move client funds to taxing authorities our clients’ employees and other payees via electronic transfer direct deposit prepaid access and adpcheck in 2019 the office of the comptroller of currency the “occ” authorized us to open adp trust company national association the “adp trust bank” via a national trust bank charter pursuant to the national bank act the adp trust bank is the sole trustee of adp client trust our grantor trust which holds client funds and is responsible for the oversight and management of those client funds the adp trust bank and all of its fiduciary activities including the us money movement it oversees and manages via adp client trust is subject to comprehensive ongoing oversight and regulation by the occ we have surrendered all state money transmitter licenses as the activity previously managed through those licenses was moved into the adp client trust managed by adp trust bank which is federally exempt from state money transmitter regulation with respect to the client money movement activity that it manages in addition our us money movement managed by the adp trust bank and our us prepaid access offering are subject to the antimoney laundering and reporting provisions of the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 the “bsa” elements of our money 

movement activities outside of the united states are subject to licensing and similar antimoney laundering and reporting laws and requirements in the countries in which we provide such services our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the fair credit reporting act adp totalsource is subject to various state licensing requirements and maintains certifications with the internal revenue service because adp totalsource is a coemployer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees we may be subject to limited obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax insurance and employment laws our registered investment adviser provides certain investment management and advisory services to retirement plan administrators under a heightened “fiduciary” standard and is regulated by the sec and the us department of labor adp brokerdealer inc which supports our retirement services business is a registered brokerdealer regulated by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority finra 

in addition many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to adp changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations products and services for example our payroll services are designed to facilitate compliance with state laws and regulations applicable to the payment of wages in addition our hcm solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the affordable care act in the united states similarly our tax credit services business which helps clients in the united states take advantage of tax credit opportunities in connection with the hiring of new employees and certain other activities is based on federal state or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits which are subject to renewal amendment or rescission 

we believe that key components of our compliance programs provide real competitive differentiators for instance our bcrs have enabled adp to apply a global standard of data protection simplifying data transfer processes and assisting our clients in meeting the demanding standards of data protection expected in europe – a solution that most competitors cannot provide similarly the adp client trust and adp trust bank provide client funds with a level of protection that most competitors cannot offer we continue to expand our approach to compliance and are adopting “compliance by design” as a tenet that prioritizes compliance in designing and developing new solutions to support our clients 

the foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business see the discussion contained in the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding changes in laws 

and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

clients and client contracts 

we provide services to more than 920000 clients in fiscal 2021 no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2 of our annual consolidated revenues 

we are continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client the installation or conversion period for new clients can vary from a short period of time for a small employer services client as little as 24 hours to a longer period for a large employer services client with multiple deliverables generally six to nine months in some cases based on a clients timeline the period may exceed two years for a large multicountry globalview client or other large multiphase implementation although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business this metric is not a reported number but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients in addition some of our products and services are sold under longerterm contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years however this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of our expected future revenue is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not material to managements estimate of our future revenue 

our business is typically characterized by longterm client relationships that result in recurring revenue our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions no one price quotation or service agreement is material to us based on our retention levels in fiscal 2021 our client retention is estimated at approximately 13 years in employer services and approximately 7 years in peo while our client retention rate historically has not varied significantly from year to year we experienced an increase in our employer services rate in fiscal 2021 that we believe was driven primarily by a combination of improvement in client satisfaction and a decrease in clients switching providers during the covid19 pandemic 

product development 

we continually upgrade enhance and expand our solutions and services in general new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing 

solutions and services and given our recurring revenue model do not have a material and immediate effect on our revenues we believe that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles 

systems development and programming 

during the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 2020 and 2019 we invested approximately 1016 billion 947 million and 911 million respectively in systems development and programming these investments include expenses for activities such as the development of new products maintenance expenses associated with our existing technologies purchases of new software and software licenses additions to software resulting from business combinations as well as client migrations to our new strategic cloudbased platforms

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or reputation 

legal and compliance risks 

failure to comply with or changes in laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the laws and regulations described in the “industry regulation” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could cause us to incur substantial costs or could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines and lawsuits including class actions that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

in addition changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities changes in us or foreign 

tax laws regulations or rulings or the interpretation thereof could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business health care reform under the affordable care act related state laws and the regulations thereunder as well as the uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act have the potential to further impact the demand for our health care compliance solutions we are unable to determine the additional impact that any of this will have on our peo business our ability to attract and retain peo clients or demand for our health care compliance solutions 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations economic and trade sanctions antimoney laundering laws and regulations and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

regulators worldwide continue to exercise a high level of scrutiny with respect to anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations such scrutiny has resulted in aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and burdensome regulations any of which could materially adversely impact our business we operate our business around the world including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties and in some cases to other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations among others in addition some of our businesses and entities in the us and a number of other countries in which we operate are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including for example the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 the “bsa” among other things the bsa requires certain financial institutions including banks and money services businesses such as national trust banks and providers of prepaid access like us to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records we have registered our payroll card 

business as a provider of prepaid access and registered our adp trust bank with the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network fincen 

we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations and we regularly review upgrade and enhance our policies and procedures however there can be no assurance that our employees consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators any violations of applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition further bank regulators including the occ which regulates the adp trust bank continue to impose additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses as a class to be higher risk customers for money laundering as a result our banking partners that assist in processing our money movement transactions may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional material requirements on us these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal riskbased policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us may require us to materially change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

failure to comply with privacy data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

the collection storage hosting transfer processing disclosure use security and retention and destruction of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal state and foreign privacy data protection and cyber security laws these laws which are not uniform generally do one or more of the following regulate the collection storage hosting transfer including in some cases the transfer outside the country of collection processing disclosure use security and retention and destruction of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information and regulate the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing under certain circumstances some of these 

laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals clients data protection authorities andor other regulators in the event of a data breach in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries the european union the “eu” general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and state consumer privacy laws like the california consumer protection act the “ccpa” which will be replaced by the voterapproved california privacy rights act of 2020 the “cpra” are among the most comprehensive of these laws and more and more jurisdictions are adopting similarly comprehensive laws that impose new data privacy protection requirements and restrictions as part of our overall data protection compliance program in connection with the gdpr we implemented binding corporate rules “bcrs” as both a data processor and data controller which permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with eu data protection laws 

we believe that providing insights from data including artificial intelligence and machine learning will become increasingly important to the value that our solutions and services deliver to our customers however the ability to provide datadriven insights may be constrained by current or future regulatory requirements or ethical considerations that could restrict or impose burdensome and costly requirements on our ability to leverage data in innovative ways 

complying with privacy data protection and cyber security laws and requirements including the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr our bcrs and the ccpa and cpra may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices further enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability and damage our reputation in addition data security events and concerns about privacy abuses by other companies are changing consumer and social expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection as a result even the perception of noncompliance whether or not valid may damage our reputation 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

our ability to compete and our success depend in part upon our intellectual property we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark laws and 

confidentiality or license agreements with our employees customers vendors partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights we may need to devote significant resources including cybersecurity resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights in addition the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or ineffective or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by third parties or our personnel litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and timeconsuming furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights which may be successful 

we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights which could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

there is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry third parties including our competitors may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our products or services and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing upon such rights even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and if successfully asserted against us or if we decide to settle could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments obtain licenses modify applications prevent us from offering our services or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers vendors or partners in connection with any such claim or litigation even if we were to prevail in such a dispute any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming

our businesses collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and retain and dispose of personal and business information and collect hold and transmit client funds and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation increase our costs cause losses and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with our business we collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and retain and dispose of large amounts of personal and business information about our clients employees of our clients our vendors and our employees contractors and temporary 

staff including payroll information health care information personal and business financial data social security numbers and their foreign equivalents bank account numbers tax information and other sensitive personal and business information we also collect significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients and transmit them to their employees taxing authorities and others 

we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and client funds and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes nonetheless the global environment continues to grow increasingly hostile as attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics code and viruses certain of these malicious parties may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources although this is a global problem it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent parties including our personnel may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and retain and dispose of and the client funds that we collect and transmit 

we have programs and processes in place to prevent detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures our ability to address cyber security incidents may also depend on the timing and nature of assistance that may be provided from relevant governmental or law enforcement agencies hardware software applications or services that we develop or procure from third parties or are required by third parties such as foreign governments to install on our systems may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could or in respect of thirdparty software may be designed to compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data or our systems unauthorized parties also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our personnel including phishing and other social engineering techniques whereby attackers use enduser behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into our systems or otherwise compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data on our systems as these threats continue to evolve and increase we continue to invest significant resources and may be required to invest 

significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities in addition while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information we may not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients vendors or partners and in any event third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures information obtained by malevolent parties resulting from successful attacks against our clients vendors partners or other third parties may in turn be used to attack our information technology systems 

any cyberattack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service corruption of data theft of nonpublic or other sensitive information or similar act by a malevolent party including our personnel or inadvertent acts or inactions by our vendors partners or personnel could result in the loss disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information or the theft of client or adp funds and could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations or that of our clients result in liability litigation regulatory investigations and sanctions or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider as the global environment continues to grow increasingly hostile the security of our operating environment is ever more important to our clients and potential clients as a result the breach or perceived breach of our security systems could result in a loss of confidence by our clients or potential clients and cause them to choose another service provider which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data or cyber security incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us a data or cyber security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation while adp maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of data and cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of data and cyber risk 

our systems applications solutions and services may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial 

accounting and other data processing systems we need to properly manage our systems applications and solutions and any upgrades enhancements and expansions we may undertake from time to time in order to ensure they properly support our businesses if any of these systems applications or solutions fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time whether due to malevolent acts errors defects or any other factors we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans and procedures may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

a disruption of the data centers or cloudcomputing services that we utilize could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

we host our applications and serve our clients with data centers that we operate and with data centers that are operated and cloudcomputing services that are provided by thirdparty vendors if any of these data centers or cloudcomputing services fails becomes disabled or is disrupted even for a limited period of time our businesses could be disrupted and we could suffer financial loss liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition in addition our thirdparty vendors may cease providing data center facilities or cloudcomputing services elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition 

business and industry risks 

if we fail to upgrade enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may materially diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our technology solutions and 

services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish in addition investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in product development we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts before knowing to what extent our investments will result in products the market will accept in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to evaluate the new product offerings furthermore we may not execute successfully on our product development strategy including because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing and technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion 

we may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives which are designed to streamline our organization extend our worldclass distribution and strengthen our talent and culture while supporting our revenue growth margin improvement and productivity if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits improvements may be delayed not sustained or not realized and our business operations and competitive position could be adversely affected these initiatives or our failure to successfully manage them could result in unintended consequences or unforeseen costs including distraction of our management and employees attrition inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a major natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or have other adverse consequences 

our business financial condition results of operations access to capital markets and borrowing costs may be adversely affected by a major natural disaster or catastrophic event including civil unrest geopolitical instability war terrorist attack pandemics or other actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the recent covid19 outbreak or other events beyond our control and measures taken in response thereto 

the covid19 outbreak created and such other events may create significant volatility and uncertainty and economic and financial market disruption the extent of any such impact depends on developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the duration and scope of the event the governmental and business actions taken in response thereto actions taken by the company in response thereto and the related costs the impact on economic activity and employment levels the effect on our clients prospects suppliers and partners our ability to sell and provide our solutions and services including due to travel restrictions business and facility closures and employee remote working arrangements the ability of our clients or prospects to pay for our services and solutions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume in addition clients or prospects may delay decision making demand pricing and other concessions reduce the value or duration of their orders delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements our business is also impacted by employment levels across our clients as we have varied contracts throughout our business that blend base fees and peremployee fees the covid19 outbreak had a significant impact on our clients and as a result negatively impacted our revenue and new business bookings our bookings were also adversely affected by the impact of the outbreak on the buying behavior of our clients and prospects coupled with the inability of our sales force to engage with clients and prospects on an inperson basis and instead primarily leveraging virtual interactions the covidoutbreak pandemic may also have longterm effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working which may present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business 

political economic and social factors may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on hcm services or renegotiating their contracts with us which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we invest our funds held for clients in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless such investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or together during periods of unusual financial market volatility 

in addition as part of our client funds investment strategy we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in order to satisfy these shortterm funding requirements we maintain access to various sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may increase our borrowing costs andor require us to sell availableforsale securities in our funds held for clients to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements when there is a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy the company may experience a decline in client fund obligations and may also sell availableforsale securities in our funds held for clients in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client fund obligations a sale of such availableforsale securities may result in the recognition of losses and reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients either or both of which may adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll tax and other money movement services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we publicly share certain information about our environmental social and governance “esg” initiatives we may face increased scrutiny related to these activities including from the investment community and our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis if at all could impact our reputation business including employee retention and growth 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us strong investmentgrade longterm debt ratings and high commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required 

by our employer services business and adversely impact our results of operations 

our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others 

we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders responding to such actions could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our business and operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy including with respect to our esg efforts which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers vendors investors and other third parties in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients and reflecting diverse perspectives and the diversity of our communities and clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled motivated and diverse personnel results of our operations and culture may suffer

we believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance the nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations since these adjusted financial measures and other nongaap metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap they should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to their corresponding us gaap measures and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies 



a we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model the adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “all other interest expense” and “all other interest income” 

b in fiscal 2021 transformation initiatives include impairment charges as a result of recognizing certain owned facilities at fair value given intent to sell and accordingly classified as held for sale and lease asset impairment charges offset by gain on sale of assets and net reversals of charges related to other transformation initiatives including severance 

unlike other severance charges which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results these specific charges relate to actions taken as part of our broadbased companywide transformation initiative 

c represents net severance cost related to excess capacity unlike certain other severance charges in prior periods that are not 

included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broadbased 

companywide initiatives to address excess capacity across our business and functions including charges in fiscal 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 

d represents legal settlements including an insurance recovery in fiscal 2021 

e the income tax provisionbenefit was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect for the year ended june 30 2021 

f the adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our adjusted net earnings plus our adjusted provision for income taxes 

the following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the nongaap measure of organic constant currency which excludes the impact of acquisitions the impact of dispositions and the impact of foreign currency the impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the oneyear anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the oneyear period preceding the transaction the impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year the peo segment is not impacted by acquisitions dispositions or foreign currency 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

as of june 30 2021 cash and cash equivalent s were 26 billion which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds 

for corporate liquidity we expect existing cash cash equivalents longterm marketable securities cash flow from operations together with our 97 billion of co mmitted credit facilities and our ability to access both longterm and shortterm debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends share repurchases and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future our financial condition remains solid at june 30 2021 and we have sufficient liquidity as noted above how ever given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the covid19 pandemic we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our financial condition and liquidity 

for client funds liquidity we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our us shortterm commercial paper program and our us canadian and united kingdom shortterm reverse repurchase agreements together with our 97 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations please see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a further discussion of the risks including with respect to the covid19 pandemic related to our client funds extended investment strategy see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our shortterm financing including commercial paper 

operating investing and financing cash flow s 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows are summarized as follows 

net cash flows provided by operating activities increase d due to a net favorable change in the components of operating assets and liabilities as compared to the year ended june 30 2020 

net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of 67712 million 

net cash flows from financing activities changed due to a net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of 115494 million which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients employees and other payees and proceeds fro m debt issuances these were partially offset by payments of debt more cash returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends and settlement of cash flow hedges in fiscal 2021 

we purchased approximately 82 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 17004 during fis cal 2021 as compared to purchases of 62 million shares at an average price per share of 16061 during fiscal 2020 from time to time the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things actual and potential acquisition activity cash balances and cash flows issuances due to employee benefit plan activity and market conditions 

capital resources and client fund obligations 

we have 30 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025 2028 and 2030 we may from time to time revisit the longterm debt market to refinance existing debt finance investments including acquisitions for our growth and maintain the appropriate capital structure however there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our notes 

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securiti es this commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to 97 billion in aggregate maturity value  our c ommercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s prime1 “p1” by moody’s and f1 by fitch these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days at june 30 2021 and 2020 we had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows 



our us canadian and united kingdom shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by 

government and government agency securities rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an asneeded basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations at june 30 2021 and 2020 there were 235 million and 136 million respectively of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows 



we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility we have a 375 billion 364day credit agreement that matures in june 2022 with a one year termout option in addition we have a fiveyear 275 billion credit facility and a fiveyear 32 billion credit facility maturing in june 2024 and june 2026 respectively each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by 500 million subject to the availability of additional commitments the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes if necessary we ha d no borrowings thr ough june 30 2021 under the credit facilities we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the 97 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our shortterm financing including credit facilities 

our investment portfolio does not contain any assetbacked securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages alternativea mortgages subprime auto loans or subprime home equity loans collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations credit default swaps derivatives auction rate securities structured investment vehicles or noninvestment grade fixedincome securities we own aaarated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan credit card equipment lease and rate reduction receivables secured predominantly by prime collateral all collateral on assetbacked securities is performing as expected through june 30 2021 in addition we own us government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by federal farm credit banks and federal home loan banks our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations see note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 were 1783 million as compared to 1683 million for fiscal 2020 we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be between 200 million and 225 million 

contractual obligations 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at june 30 2021 

1 these amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt 

2 included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements 

3 purchase obligations are comprised of a 260 million reinsurance premium with chubb for the fiscal 2022 policy year as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software equipment and other assets 

4 based on current estimates we expect to make cash payments up to 148 million in the next twelve months for obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits across various jurisdictions and tax periods for 851 million of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments are expected to be paid 

5 compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans which are expected to be 100 million in fiscal 2022 

in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services as of june 30 2021 the obligations relating to these matters which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2022 total 344038 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets we had 349058 million of cas h and cash e quivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2021 

separately adp indemnity paid a p remium of 260 million in ju ly 2021 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2022 policy year at june 30 2021 adp indemnity had total assets of 5642 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of 4874 million for the policy years since july 1 2003 adp indemnity paid claims of 33 million and 44 million net of insurance recoveries in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively refer to the “analysis of reportable segments  peo services” above for additional information regarding adp indemnity 

in the normal course of business we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends share repurchases capital expenditures andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary objectives consistent with those objectives we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities in circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s 

obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 97 billion commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s p1 by moody’s and f1 by fitch the highest possible shortterm credit ratings and our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our 97 billion committed credit facilities the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil including the covid19 pandemic even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate canadian government agency and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbbrated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 10 years and for aarated and aaarated securities is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

  

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rat e changes the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio decreased from 21 for fiscal 2020 to 15 for fiscal 2021 a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 22 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2022 a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately an 10 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2022 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaarated and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s dbrs for canadian dollar denominated securities and fitch for assetbacked and commercialmortgagebacked securities approxi mately 72 of our a vailableforsale securities held a aaarating or aarating at june 30 2021 in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us government and government agency canadian government and united kingdom government securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and other comprehensive income we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management in addition as the duration and severity of covid19 pandemic are uncertain certain of our estimates could require further judgment or modification and therefore carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are revenue recognition including deferred costs goodwill and income taxes refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our policies for revenue recognition including deferred costs goodwill and income taxes 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired 

the company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2021 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using as appropriate the income approach which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and the market approach which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates profitability projections working capital assumptions the weighted average cost of capital the determination of appropriate market comparison companies and terminal growth rates several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences as such the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins based upon the quantitative assessment the company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired as the assumptions used in the income approach and market approach can have a material impact on the fair value determinations we performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values

our business is typically characterized by longterm client relationships that result in recurring revenue our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions no one price quotation or service agreement is material to us our client retention is estimated at approximately 11 years in employer services and approximately 7 years in peo and has not varied significantly from period to period 

product development 

we continually upgrade enhance and expand our solutions and services in general new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and given our recurring revenue model do not have a material and immediate effect on our revenues we believe that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles 

systems development and programming 

during the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 2019 and 2018 we invested approximately 947 million 911 million and 1 billion respectively in systems development and programming these investments include expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic cloudbased platforms purchases of new software and software licenses additions to software resulting from business combinations as well as the development of new products and maintenance expenses associated with our existing technologies

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or reputation 

failure to comply with or changes in laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the laws and regulations described in the “industry regulation” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

in addition changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of 

our peo business health care reform under the affordable care act related state laws and the regulations thereunder as well as the uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act have the potential to further impact the health insurance market for our peo business and the demand for our health care compliance solutions we are unable to determine the additional impact that any of this will have on our peo business our ability to attract and retain peo clients or demand for our health care compliance solutions 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations economic and trade sanctions antimoney laundering laws and regulations and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations any of which could materially adversely impact our business we operate our business around the world including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties and in some cases to other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations among others in addition some of our businesses and entities in the us and a number of other countries in which we operate are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including for example the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2000 the “bsa” among other things the bsa requires certain financial institutions including banks and money services businesses such as national trust banks and providers of prepaid access like us to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records we have registered our payroll card business as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to applicable regulation and our adp trust bank with the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network fincen 

we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations and we are continuously in the process of reviewing upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures however there can be no assurance that our employees consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators any violations of applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition further bank regulators including the occ which regulates the adp trust bank are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses as a class to be higher risk customers for money laundering as a result our banking partners that assist in processing our money movement transactions may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional material requirements on us these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal riskbased policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us may require us to materially change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

failure to comply with privacy data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

the collection storage hosting transfer processing disclosure use security and retention and destruction of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal state and foreign privacy data protection and cyber security laws these laws which are not uniform generally do one or more of the following regulate the collection storage hosting transfer including in some cases the transfer outside the country of collection processing disclosure use security and retention and destruction of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information and regulate the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing under certain circumstances some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals clients data protection authorities andor other regulators in the event of a data breach in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but 

also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries the european union the “eu” general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and the california consumer protection act the “ccpa” which became effective on january 1 2020 are among the most comprehensive of these laws as part of our overall data protection compliance program in connection with the gdpr we implemented binding corporate rules “bcrs” as both a data processor and data controller which permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with eu data protection laws complying with these laws and requirements including the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr our bcrs and the ccpa may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices further enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability and damage our reputation in addition data security events and concerns about privacy abuses by other companies are changing consumer and social expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection as a result even the perception of noncompliance whether or not valid may damage our reputation 

our businesses collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and retain and dispose of personal and business information and collect hold and transmit client funds and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation increase our costs cause losses and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with our business we collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and retain and dispose of large amounts of personal and business information about our clients employees of our clients our vendors and our employees contractors and temporary staff including payroll information health care information personal and business financial data social security numbers and their foreign equivalents bank account numbers tax information and other sensitive personal and business information we also collect and transmit significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients to their employees taxing authorities and others 

we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and client funds and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes nonetheless the global environment grows increasingly hostile as attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in 

frequency complexity and sophistication and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics code and viruses certain of these malicious parties may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources although this is a global problem it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent parties including our personnel may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and retain and dispose of and the client funds that we collect and transmit 

we have programs and processes in place to prevent detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties or are required by third parties such as foreign governments to install on our systems may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could or in respect of third party software may be designed to compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data or our systems unauthorized parties also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our personnel including phishing and other social engineering techniques whereby attackers use enduser behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into our systems as these threats continue to evolve and increase we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities in addition while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information we may not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients vendors or partners and in any event third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures information obtained by malevolent parties resulting from successful attacks against our clients vendors partners or other third parties may in turn be used to attack our information technology systems 

any cyberattack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service corruption of data theft of nonpublic or other sensitive information or similar act by a malevolent party including our personnel or inadvertent acts or inactions by our vendors partners or personnel could result in the loss disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information or the theft of client funds and could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of 

operations or that of our clients result in liability litigation regulatory investigations and sanctions or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider as the global environment grows increasingly hostile the security of our operating environment is ever more important to our clients and potential clients as a result the breach or perceived breach of our security systems could result in a loss of confidence by our clients or potential clients and cause them to choose another service provider which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data or cyber security incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us a data or cyber security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation while adp maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of data and cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of data and cyber risk 

our systems applications solutions and services may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems we need to properly manage our systems applications and solutions and any upgrades enhancements and expansions we may undertake from time to time in order to ensure they properly support our businesses if any of these systems applications or solutions fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time whether due to malevolent acts errors defects or any other factors we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans and procedures may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

a disruption of the data centers or cloudcomputing services that we utilize could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

we host our applications and serve our clients with data centers that we operate and with data centers that are operated and cloudcomputing services that are provided by thirdparty vendors if any of these data centers or cloudcomputing services fails becomes disabled or is disrupted even for a limited period of time our businesses could be disrupted and we could suffer financial loss liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition in addition our thirdparty vendors may cease providing data center facilities or cloudcomputing services elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

our ability to compete and our success depend in part upon our intellectual property we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees customers vendors partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights we may need to devote significant resources including cybersecurity resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights in addition the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or ineffective or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by third parties or our personnel litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and timeconsuming furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights which may be successful 

we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights which could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

there is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry third parties including our competitors may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our products or services and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing upon such rights even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights any claims or 

litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and if successfully asserted against us or if we decide to settle could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments obtain licenses modify applications prevent us from offering our services or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers vendors or partners in connection with any such claim or litigation even if we were to prevail in such a dispute any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming 

if we fail to upgrade enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may materially diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our technology solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish in addition investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in product development we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts before knowing to what extent our investments will result in products the market will accept in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to evaluate the new product offerings furthermore we may not execute successfully on our product development strategy including because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing and technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion 

we may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives which are designed to streamline our organization extend our worldclass distribution and strengthen our talent and culture while supporting our revenue growth margin improvement and productivity if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits improvements may be delayed not sustained or not realized and our business operations and competitive position could be adversely affected these initiatives or our failure to successfully manage them could result in 

unintended consequences or unforeseen costs including distraction of our management and employees attrition inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a major natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or have other adverse consequences 

our business financial condition results of operations access to capital markets and borrowing costs may be adversely affected by a major natural disaster or catastrophic event including civil unrest geopolitical instability war terrorist attack or pandemics or other public health emergencies such as the recent covid19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto 

the covid19 outbreak has created and such other events may create significant volatility and uncertainty and economic and financial market disruption the extent of any such impact depends on developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the duration and scope of the event the governmental and business actions taken in response thereto actions taken by the company in response thereto and the related costs the impact on economic activity and employment levels the effect on our clients prospects suppliers and partners our ability to sell and provide our solutions and services including due to travel restrictions business and facility closures and employee remote working arrangements the ability of our clients or prospects to pay for our services and solutions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume in addition clients or prospects may delay decision making demand pricing and other concessions reduce the value or duration of their orders delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements our business is also impacted by employment levels across our clients as we have varied contracts throughout our business that blend base fees and peremployee fees to date the covid19 outbreak has had a significant impact on our clients and as a result our revenue and new business bookings have been and we expect will continue to be negatively impacted our bookings have also been adversely affected by the impact of the outbreak on the buying behavior of our clients and prospects coupled with the inability of our sales force to engage with clients and prospects on an inperson basis and instead primarily leveraging virtual interactions 

political and economic factors may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a 

corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on hcm services or renegotiating their contracts with us which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we invest our funds held for clients in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless such investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or together during periods of unusual financial market volatility 

in addition as part of our client funds investment strategy we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in order to satisfy these shortterm funding requirements we maintain access to various sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may increase our borrowing costs andor require us to sell availableforsale securities in our funds held for clients to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements when there is a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy the company may experience a decline in client fund obligations and may also sell availableforsale securities in our funds held for clients in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client fund obligations a sale of such availableforsale securities may result in the recognition of losses and reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients either or both of which may adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll tax and other money movement services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others 

we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders 

responding to such actions could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our business and operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers vendors investors and other third parties in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us strong investmentgrade longterm debt ratings and high commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and adversely impact our results of operations 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results of our operations may suffer

executive overview 

highlights from the year ended june 30 2020 include 

the global covid19 pandemic has continued to evolve and our priority has been and continues to be the safety of our associates and the needs of our clients in march 2020 we implemented our business continuity plan and took steps to shift over 98 of our workforce to work from home or offsite locations to ensure uninterrupted service to our clients across our solutions while we are wellprepared to continue operating this way we are in the early stages of bringing back a small portion of our workforce to the office on a volunteeronly basis our sales force will continue to primarily engage with prospects and clients virtually however we are beginning to conduct facetoface meetings in certain geographies to the extent our employees clients and prospects are ready to do so we announced for our employees excluding corporate officers a onetime global associate assistance payment of 1000 or equivalent based on the average wage parity in each country in response to covid19 totaling 504 million we are also deeply embedded in our local communities and continue to support covid19 relief efforts through financial donations and donations of medical supplies for hospital workers globally 

as a leading global provider of cloudbased human capital management “hcm” technology solutions to employers around the world we have continued to process payroll and tax obligations and provide other hcm services to our clients despite the unexpected challenges that our clients and their employees around the world are facing adps efforts have been focused on providing information and tools to help clients understand and navigate the governmental relief that has been adopted globally for example the federal government in the united states enacted the families first coronavirus response act “ffcra” and the coronavirus aid relief and economic security “cares” act adp has been working to provide support to all employers on the relief available under both laws this includes an employer preparedness toolkit that helps explain the federal and state government relief as well as a website dedicated to providing critical information about the small business administration paycheck protection program “ppp” during the second half of fiscal 2020 we rolled out a range of tools and reports to help our clients through the crisis and prepare for the recovery we implemented over 1000 feature changes to our products in response to 2000 legislative updates in 60 countries and we also had approximately 400000 clients run over 2 million ppp reports for total loan values up to 115 billion dollars many of those clients have also now run the necessary payroll reports to apply for their loans to be forgiven as the global economy and landscape continues to evolve for our clients whether due to legislative changes or other factors adp is committed to supporting our clients to help them navigate these challenges 

the significant impact the covid19 pandemic is having on our clients and the broader economy is in turn having an effect on our reported metrics despite the fact that we have seen improvement as countries and states are in various stages of reopening and businesses gradually begin to bring a portion of their workers back weve seen the impact on our full year fiscal 2020 results employer services new business bookings was down 21 for fiscal 2020 as we saw bookings decline significantly and rapidly in midmarch due to the global social distancing guidelines coupled with the delayed decision making of our clients and prospects which continued into the fourth quarter we also adjusted gross bookings as a result of client delays on implementation and the expectation that fewer client employees would come on board compared to when the business was originally signed the peo average number of worksite employees increased 4 for fiscal 2020 our pays per control metric which represents growth of the employee base for a large portion of our client base showed a decline in the fourth quarter 

resulting in annual growth of negative 10 for fiscal 2020 in addition we saw deterioration in employer services retention in fiscal 2020 of 20 basis points to 905 due to an increase in outofbusiness losses 

while the challenges presented by covid19 may affect the timing of our execution of parts of our strategy we remain on a transformation journey and our initiatives are yielding efficiencies and are focused on changing how we work in fiscal 2020 we executed on our workforce optimization program and procurement transformation initiatives for fiscal 2021 we are moving forward with a digital implementation and servicing initiative that leverages many of the capabilities we highlighted at our february 2020 innovation day despite a challenging end to fiscal 2020 we continued to deliver profit growth during the year ended june 30 2020 we will continue to monitor macro trends based on externally and internally available data and are using these indicators to drive realtime decisions as we remain committed to our longterm strategy 

we have a strong business model a highly cash generative business with low capital intensity and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients’ hcm functions we generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our reinvestments our longer term strategy and our commitments to shareholder friendly actions we are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate our financial condition remains solid at june 30 2020 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to our gaap results we use the adjusted results and other nongaap metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods 



we believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance the nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations since these adjusted financial measures and other nongaap metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap they should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to their corresponding us gaap measures and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies

the following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the nongaap measure of organic constant currency which excludes the impact of acquisitions the impact of dispositions and the impact of foreign currency the impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the oneyear anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the oneyear period preceding the transaction the impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year the peo segment is not impacted by acquisitions dispositions or foreign currency 



financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

as of june 30 2020 cash and cash equivalent s were 19 billion which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds 

for corporate liquidity we expect existing cash cash equivalents longterm marketable securities cash flow from operations together with our 97 billion of co mmitted credit facilities and our ability to access both longterm and shortterm debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing activities such as regular 

quarterly dividends share repurchases and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future our financial condition remains solid at june 30 2020 and have sufficient liquidity as note above how ever given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the covid19 pandemic we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our financial condition and liquidity

net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 include cash payments for reinsurance agreements of 2150 million and 2180 million respectively which represent the policy premium f or the entire fiscal year the increase in operating cash provided is primarily due to growth in our business supplemented by a growth in noncash expenses within operating activities and net favorable change in the components of working capital as com pared to fiscal 2019 

net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of 52569 million proceeds from the sale of assets and lower payments related to acquisitions of business partially offset by payments related to acquisitions of intangibles and payments related to capital expenditures i n fiscal 2020 

net cash flows from financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of 49092 million  which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients employees and other pay ees more cash returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and a net repayment of reverse repurchase agreements in fiscal 2020 

we purchased approximately 62 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 16061 during fis cal 2020 as compared to purchases of 65 million shares at an average price per share of 14302 during fiscal 2019 from time to time the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things actual and potential acquisition activity cash balances and cash flows issuances due to employee benefit plan activity and market conditions

we have 20 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025 we may from time to time revisit the longterm debt market to refinance existing debt finance investments including acquisitions for our growth and maintain the appropriate capital structure however there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our notes 

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securiti es in june 2020 the company decreased its us shortterm commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to 97 billion from 103 billion in aggregate maturity value our c ommercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 “p1” by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days at june 30 2020 and 2019 we had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows 



our us canadian and united kingdom shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an asneeded basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations at june 30 2020 and 2019 the company had 136 million and 2620 million respectively of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows

our investment portfolio does not contain any assetbacked securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages alternativea mortgages subprime auto loans or subprime home equity loans collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations credit default swaps derivatives auction rate securities structured investment vehicles or noninvestment grade fixedincome securities we own aaarated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan credit card equipment lease and rate reduction receivables secured predominantly by prime collateral all collateral on assetbacked securities is performing as expected in addition we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations see note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 were 1683 million  as compared to 1627 million for fiscal 2019 we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be between 175 million and 200 million 

contractual obligations 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at june 30 2020 



1 these amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt 

2 during fiscal 2020 we entered into a series of treasury rate lock transactions with an aggregate notional amount totaling 4000 million to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates in anticipation of the refinancing of our fixedrate notes due september 15 2020 these amounts represent the aggregate fair value as of june 30 2020 and is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

3 included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements 

4 purchase obligations are comprised of a 240 million reinsurance premium with chubb for the fiscal 2021 policy year as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software equipment and other assets 

5 based on current estimates we expect to make cash payments up to 37 million in the next twelve months for obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits across various jurisdictions and tax periods for 586 million of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments are expected to be paid 

6 compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans which are expected to be 93 million in fiscal 2021 

in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services as of june 30 2020 the obligations relating to these matters which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2021 total 258316 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets we had 267081 million of cash and cash e quivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2020

in the normal course of business we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the 

performance of our services and products we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends share repurchases capital expenditures andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary objectives consistent with those objectives we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities in circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client fund obligations we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 97 billion commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and p1 by moody’s the highest possible shortterm credit ratings and our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our 97 billion committed credit facilities the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil including the covid19 pandemic even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate canadian government agency and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbbrated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aarated and aaarated securities is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 



  



during the three months ended june 30 2020 the company made a decision to sell certain availableforsale securities in the funds held for clients as the company anticipated client fund obligations would decline due to reduction in employment levels from a slowdown in the economy as a result of the covid19 pandemic to maintain the size of the funds held for clients in line with client fund obligations the company reduced its holdings of availableforsale securities in the funds held for clients and sold approximately 16 billion of its availableforsale securities 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rat e changes the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio decreased from 22 for fiscal 2019 to 21 for fiscal 2020 a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 17 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2021 a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately an 8 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2021 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaarated and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s dbrs for canadian dollar denominated securities and fitch for assetbacked and commercialmortgagebacked securities approxi mately 79 of our a vailableforsale securities held a aaarating or aarating at june 30 2020 in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us government and government agency canadian government and united kingdom government securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed 

appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and other comprehensive income we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management in addition as the duration and severity of covid19 pandemic are uncertain certain of our estimates could require further judgment or modification and therefore carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are revenue recognition including deferred costs goodwill and income taxes refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our policies for revenue recognition including deferred costs goodwill and income taxes 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired 

the company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2020 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using as appropriate the income approach which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and the market approach which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates profitability projections working capital assumptions the weighted average cost of capital the determination of appropriate market comparison companies and terminal growth rates several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences as such the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins based upon the quantitative assessment the company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired as the assumptions used in the income approach and market approach can have a material impact on the fair value determinations we performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values

competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on product and service quality reputation ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of offerings and price we believe that we are competitive in each of these areas and that our leadingedge technology together with our commitment to service excellence distinguishes us from our competitors 

industry regulation 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them we have and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs 

 

as one of the world’s largest providers of hcm solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients employees of our clients vendors and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy data protection and cybersecurityrelated laws including federal state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both client employee data and our own employee data the changing nature of these laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the european union’s the “eu” general data protection regulation the gdpr and the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” will impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 imposes stricter and more comprehensive requirements on us as both a data controller and a data processor as part of our overall data protection compliance program including with respect to data protection laws in the eu we have implemented binding corporate rules “bcrs” compliance with our bcrs permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in accordance with the gdpr and other data protection laws in the eu the ccpa will become effective on january 1 2020 and will require companies to provide new data disclosure access deletion and optout rights to consumers in california in addition in the united states the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 applies to our insurance services businesses and adp totalsource 

as part of our payroll and payroll tax management services we move client funds to taxing authorities our clients’ employees and other payees via electronic transfer direct deposit prepaid access and adpcheck some elements of our us money transmission activities including our electronic payment and prepaid access payroll pay card offerings are subject to certain licensing requirements in addition our us prepaid access offering is subject to the antimoney laundering and reporting provisions of the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2000 the “bsa” elements of our money movement activities outside of the united states are subject to similar licensing and antimoney laundering and reporting laws and requirements in the countries in which we provide such services our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the fair credit reporting act adp totalsource is subject to various state licensing requirements and maintains certifications with the internal revenue service because adp totalsource is a coemployer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees we may be subject to limited obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax insurance and employment laws our registered investment adviser provides certain investment management and advisory services to retirement plan administrators under a heightened “fiduciary” standard and is regulated by the sec and the us department of labor 

in addition many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain us and foreign laws 

and regulations that apply to them although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to adp changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations products and services for example our payroll services are designed to facilitate compliance with state laws and regulations applicable to the payment of wages in addition our hcm solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the affordable care act in the united states similarly our tax credit services business which helps clients in the united states take advantage of tax credit opportunities in connection with the hiring of new employees and certain other activities is based on federal state or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits which are subject to renewal amendment or rescission 

the foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business see the discussion contained in the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

clients and client contracts 

we provide services to more than 810000 clients in fiscal 2019  no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2 of our annual consolidated revenues 

we are continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client the installation or conversion period for new clients can vary from a short period of time for a small employer services client as little as 24 hours to a longer period for a large employer services client with multiple deliverables generally six to nine months in some cases the period may exceed two years for a large multicountry globalview client or other large multiphase implementation although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business this metric is not a reported number but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients in addition some of our products and services are sold under longer term contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years however this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of our expected future revenue is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not material to managements estimate of our future revenue 

our business is typically characterized by longterm client relationships that result in recurring revenue our services are provided under written price quotations or service 

 

agreements having varying terms and conditions no one price quotation or service agreement is material to us our client retention is estimated at approximately 11 years in employer services and approximately 6 years in peo and has not varied significantly from period to period 

product development 

we continually upgrade enhance and expand our solutions and services in general new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and given our recurring revenue model do not have a material and immediate effect on our revenues we believe that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles 

systems development and programming 

during the fiscal years ended june 30 2019  2018  and 2017  we invested approximately 911 million 1 billion and 859 million respectively in systems development and programming these investments include expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic cloudbased platforms purchases of new software and software licenses additions to software resulting from business combinations as well as the development of new products and maintenance expenses associated with our existing technologies 

licenses 

we are the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases our business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses thirdparty licenses patents trademarks and franchises are not material to our business as a whole

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

failure to comply with or changes in laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the laws and regulations described in the “industry regulation” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

in addition changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business health care reform under the affordable care act related state laws and the regulations thereunder as well as the uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act have the potential to 

 

further impact the health insurance market for our peo business and the demand for our health care compliance solutions we are unable to determine the additional impact that any of this will have on our peo business our ability to attract and retain peo clients or demand for our health care compliance solutions 

amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations could require additional registration or licensing limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed and expose us to financial penalties these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations economic and trade sanctions antimoney laundering laws and regulations and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations any of which could materially adversely impact our business we operate our business around the world including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties and in some cases to other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations among others in addition some of our businesses in the us and a number of countries in which we operate are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including for example the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2000 the “bsa” among other things the bsa 

requires certain financial institutions including banks and money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records we have registered our payroll card business with the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to a fincen regulation 

we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations and we are continuously in the process of reviewing upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures however there can be no assurance that our employees consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators any violations of applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition further bank regulators are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses as a class to be higher risk customers for money laundering as a result our banking partners may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional requirements on us these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal riskbased policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

failure to comply with privacy data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

the collection storage hosting transfer processing disclosure use security and retention and destruction of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal state and foreign privacy data protection and cyber security laws these laws which are not uniform generally do one or more of the following regulate the collection storage hosting transfer including in some cases the transfer outside the country of collection processing disclosure use security and retention and destruction of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information and regulate the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary 

 

purposes such as marketing under certain circumstances some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals clients data protection authorities andor other regulators in the event of a data breach in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries the european union the “eu” general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 and the california consumer protection act the “ccpa” which will become effective on january 1 2020 are among the most comprehensive of these laws as part of our overall data protection compliance program in connection with the gdpr we implemented binding corporate rules “bcrs” as both a data processor and data controller which permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with eu data protection laws complying with these laws and requirements including the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr our bcrs and the ccpa may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices further enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability and damage our reputation in addition data security events and concerns about privacy abuses by other companies are changing consumer and social expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection as a result even the perception of noncompliance whether or not valid may damage our reputation 

our businesses collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and dispose of personal and business information and collect hold and transmit client funds and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation increase our costs cause losses and adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with our business we collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and dispose of large amounts of personal and business information about our clients employees of our clients our vendors and our employees contractors and temporary staff including payroll information health care information personal and business financial data social security numbers and their foreign equivalents bank account numbers tax information and other sensitive personal and business information we also collect and transmit significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients to their employees taxing authorities and others 

we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and client funds and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update 

our systems and processes nonetheless the global environment grows increasingly hostile as attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics code and viruses certain of these malicious parties may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources although this is a global problem it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent parties including our personnel may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect host store transfer process disclose use secure and dispose of and the client funds that we collect and transmit 

we have programs and processes in place to prevent detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data or our systems unauthorized parties also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our personnel including phishing and other social engineering techniques whereby attackers use enduser behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into our systems as these threats continue to evolve and increase we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities in addition while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients vendors or partners and in any event third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures information obtained by malevolent parties resulting from successful attacks against our clients vendors partners or other third parties may in turn be used to attack our information technology systems 

any cyberattack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service corruption of data theft of nonpublic or other sensitive information or similar act by a malevolent party including our personnel or inadvertent acts or inactions by our vendors partners or personnel could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information or the theft of client funds and could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations or that of our clients result in liability litigation regulatory investigations and sanctions or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients 

 

or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider as the global environment grows increasingly hostile the security of our operating environment is ever more important to our clients and potential clients as a result the breach or perceived breach of our security systems could result in a loss of confidence by our clients or potential clients and cause them to choose another service provider which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data or cyber security incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us a data or cyber security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation while adp maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of data and cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of data and cyber risk 

our systems applications solutions and services may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems we need to properly manage our systems applications and solutions and any upgrades enhancements and expansions we may undertake from time to time in order to ensure they properly support our businesses if any of these systems applications or solutions fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time whether due to malevolent acts errors defects or any other factors we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans and procedures may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

a disruption of our data centers could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

we host our applications and serve our clients from data centers that we operate and from data centers operated by thirdparty vendors if any of our or our thirdparty vendors data centers fails becomes disabled or is disrupted even for a limited period of time our businesses could be disrupted 

and we could suffer financial loss liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition in addition our thirdparty vendors may cease providing data center facilities or services elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

our ability to compete and our success depend in part upon our intellectual property we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees customers vendors partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights we may need to devote significant resources including cybersecurity resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights in addition the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or ineffective or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by third parties or our personnel litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and timeconsuming furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights which may be successful 

we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights which could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

there is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry third parties including our competitors may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our products or services and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing upon such rights even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and if successfully asserted against us or if we decide to settle could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments obtain licenses modify applications prevent us from offering our services or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers vendors or partners in connection with any such claim or litigation even if we were to prevail in such a dispute any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming 

 

if we fail to upgrade enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our technology solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish in addition investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in product development we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts before knowing to what extent our investments will result in products the market will accept in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to evaluate the new product offerings furthermore we may not execute successfully on our product development strategy including because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing and technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion 

we may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives which are designed to streamline our organization extend our worldclass distribution and strengthen our talent and culture while supporting our revenue growth margin improvement and productivity if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits improvements may be delayed not sustained or not realized and our business operations and competitive position could be adversely affected these initiatives or our failure to successfully manage them could result in unintended consequences or unforeseen costs including distraction of our management and employees attrition inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on hcm services or 

renegotiating their contracts with us which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or together during periods of unusual financial market volatility in addition as part of our client funds investment strategy we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in order to satisfy these shortterm funding requirements we maintain access to various sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may require us to sell client fund assets to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements which may result in the recognition of losses and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll tax and other money movement services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others 

we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders responding to such actions could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our business and operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers vendors investors and other third parties in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors 

 

that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong investmentgrade longterm debt ratings and the highest commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and adversely impact our results of operations 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results of our operations may suffer

nm  not meaningful 

note 1 nongaap measures 

in addition to our gaap results we use the adjusted results and other nongaap metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods 



we believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations since these adjusted financial measures and other nongaap metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap they should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to their corresponding us gaap measures and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies 



see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for a summary of adjustments

fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model the adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “all other interest expense” and “all other interest income”

e the tax benefitprovision on the transformation initiatives gain on sale of asset and nonoperational charges related to proxy contest matters was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment 

f the net benefit for fiscal 2018 is comprised of the remeasurement of deferred tax balances resulting in a onetime benefit primarily as a result of asc 606 using the lower tax rates enacted under the tax cuts and jobs act “act” adjustments to the onetime transition tax on the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries foreign withholding taxes and a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits which may not be realized under the act refer to note 13  of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail

net cash flows from financing activities changed primarily due to a net increase  in the cash flow from client funds obligations of 13556 million  which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients employees and other payees more cash returned to shareholders via dividends in fiscal 2019  partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements and less cash paid for share repurchases 

we purchased approximately 65 million  shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 14302  during fiscal 2019  as compared to purchases of 85 million  shares at an average price per share of 11607  during fiscal 2018  from time to time the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program the company 

considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things actual and potential acquisition activity cash balances and cash flows issuances due to employee benefit plan activity and market conditions 

  

fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   

net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to growth in our underlying business net income adjusted for noncash adjustments such as the verp in fiscal 2018 and the gain on the sale of cobra and chsa in fiscal 2017 

net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds offset by purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of 6326 million payments made related to acquisitions in fiscal 2018 and proceeds from the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses of 2340 million in fiscal 2017 

net cash flows from financing activities changed due to net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of 64610 million which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients employees and other payees and less cash paid for share repurchases 

we purchased approximately 85 million  shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 11607  during fiscal 2018  as compared to purchases of 135 million  shares at an average price per share of 9442  during fiscal 2017  the increased cash flow from client fund obligations and reduced share repurchases were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders via dividends which increased by 685 million from fiscal 2017 

  

capital resources and client fund obligations 

we have 20 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025 we may from time to time revisit the longterm debt market to refinance existing debt finance investments including acquisitions for our growth and maintain the appropriate capital structure however there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all see note 11  of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our longterm financing 

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities in june 2019 the company increased its us shortterm commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to 103 billion  from 98 billion  in aggregate maturity value our commercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 “p1” by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days in fiscal 2019  and 2018  our average daily borrowings were 28 billion  at a weighted average interest rate of 22  and 14  respectively the weighted average maturity of our commercial paper during fiscal 2019  and 2018  was approximately two days  at june 30 2019  and 2018  we had no  outstanding obligations under our shortterm commercial paper program 

our us canadian and united kingdom shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations at june 30 2019  the company had 2620 million of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements all outstanding reverse repurchase obligations matured and were fully paid in early july 2019 at june 30 2018  there were no  outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements for fiscal 2019  and 2018  we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of 3167 million  and 3744 million  respectively at weighted average interest rates of 19  and 13  respectively see the consolidated balance sheets of our consolidated financial statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements 

we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility we have a 38 billion  364day credit agreement that matures in june 2020  with a one year termout option in addition we have a fiveyear 375 billion  credit facility and a fiveyear 275 billion  credit facility maturing in june 2023  and june 2024  respectively each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by  500 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and 

funding for general corporate purposes if necessary we had no borrowings through june 30 2019  under the credit facilities we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the 103 billion  available to us under the revolving credit agreements see note 10  of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our shortterm financing including credit facilities 

our investment portfolio does not contain any assetbacked securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages alternativea mortgages subprime auto loans or subprime home equity loans collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations credit default swaps derivatives auction rate securities structured investment vehicles or noninvestment grade fixedincome securities we own aaa rated senior tranches of fixed rate auto loan credit card equipment lease and rate reduction receivables secured predominantly by prime collateral all collateral on assetbacked securities is performing as expected in addition we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations see note 7  of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2019  were 1627 million  as compared to 1919 million  for fiscal 2018  we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2020  to be about 175 million 

contractual obligations 

 the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at june 30 2019  



 

 

 

 

 

in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services as of june 30 2019  the obligations relating to these matters which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2020  total 291445 million  and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets we had 

294342 million  of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2019  

separately adp indemnity paid a premium of 2150 million  in july 2019  to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2020  policy year at june 30 2019  adp indemnity had total assets of 5758 million  to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of 4481 million  for the policy years since july 1 2003 adp indemnity paid claims of  40 million  and 46 million  net of insurance recoveries in fiscal 2019  and 2018  respectively refer to the analysis of reportable segments  peo services above for additional information regarding adp indemnity 

in the normal course of business we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary objectives consistent with those objectives we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 103 billion  commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and p1 by moody’s the highest possible shortterm credit ratings our ability to engage in reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our 103 billion  committed credit facilities the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating for corporate canadian government agency and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbbrated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aarated and aaarated securities is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

  



we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased from 19  for fiscal 2018  to 22  for fiscal 2019  a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 13 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2020  a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2020  

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s dbrs for canadian dollar denominated securities and fitch for assetbacked and commercialmortgagebacked securities approximately 79  of our availableforsale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30 2019  in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us government and government agency canadian government and united kingdom gilt securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30 2019  or 2018

as one of the world’s largest providers of hcm solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients employees of our clients vendors and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy data protection and cybersecurityrelated laws including federal state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data the changing nature of these laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the adoption by the european union the “eu” of the general data protection regulation the gdpr will impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 imposes stricter and more comprehensive requirements on us as both a data controller and data processor as part of our overall data protection compliance program including with respect to data protection laws in the eu in february 2018 we obtained approval from all 28 eu data protection authorities to implement binding corporate rules “bcrs” compliance with our bcrs will permit us to process and transfer personal data across borders in accordance with gdpr and other data protection laws in the eu in addition in the united states the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 applies to our insurance services businesses and adp totalsource

adp is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client the installation or conversion period for new clients can vary from a short period of time for a small employer services client as little as 24 hours to a longer period for a large employer services client with multiple deliverables generally six to nine months in some cases the period may exceed two years for a large multicountry globalview client or other large complicated implementation although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business this metric is not a reported number but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients in addition some of our products and services are sold under longer term contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years however this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of adp’s expected future revenue is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not material to managements estimate of adp’s future revenue

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

failure to comply with or changes in laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the laws and regulations described in the “industry regulation” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

in addition changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business health care reform under the affordable care act related state laws and the regulations thereunder as well as the uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act have the potential to further impact the health insurance market for our peo business and the demand for our health care compliance solutions we are unable to determine the additional impact that any of this will have on our peo business our ability to attract and retain peo clients or demand for our health care compliance solutions 

amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations could require additional registration or licensing limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed and expose us to financial penalties these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations antimoney laundering laws and regulations economic and trade sanctions and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations any of which could adversely impact our business we operate our business around the world including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government   officials and leaders of political parties and in some cases to other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations among others in addition some of our businesses in the us and a number of countries in which we operate are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including for example the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2000 the “bsa” among other things the bsa requires certain financial institutions including banks and money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records we have registered our payroll card business with the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to a fincen regulation 

we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations and we are continuously in the process of reviewing upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures however there can be no assurance that our employees consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators any violations of applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our 

business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition further bank regulators are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses as a class to be higher risk customers for money laundering as a result our banking partners may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional requirements on us these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal riskbased policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

failure to comply with privacy data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

the collection hosting transfer disclosure use storage and security of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal state and foreign privacy data protection and cyber security laws these laws which are not uniform do one or more of the following regulate the collection transfer including in some cases the transfer outside the country of collection processing storage security use disclosure and disposal of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing under certain circumstances some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals clients data protection authorities andor other regulators in the event of a data breach in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries the european union the “eu” general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 is one of the most comprehensive of these laws as part of our overall data protection compliance program in february 2018 we obtained approval from all 28 eu data protection authorities to implement binding corporate rules “bcrs” as both a data processor and data controller which permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with eu data protection laws complying with these laws and requirements including the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr and our bcrs may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices further enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability 

our businesses collect host transfer disclose use store and secure personal and business information and collect store and transmit client funds and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation increase our costs cause losses and adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with our business we collect host transfer disclose use store and secure large amounts of personal and business information about our clients employees of our clients our vendors and our employees contractors and temporary staff including payroll information health care information personal and business financial data social security numbers and their foreign equivalents bank account numbers tax information and other sensitive personal and business information we also collect and transmit significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients to their employees taxing authorities and others 

we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and client funds and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes nonetheless globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics code and viruses although this is a global problem it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent third parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect host use transmit and store and the clients funds that we collect and transmit 

we have programs in place to prevent detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other 

problems that could compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data or our systems unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our employees contractors and temporary staff as these threats continue to evolve and increase we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities in addition while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients vendors or partners and in any event third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures information obtained by malevolent parties resulting from successful attacks against our clients vendors partners or other third parties may in turn be used to attack our information technology systems 

any cyberattack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service corruption of data theft of nonpublic or other sensitive information or similar act by a malevolent party or inadvertent acts or inactions by our employees contractors or temporary staff could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information or the theft of client funds and could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations or that of our clients result in liability litigation regulatory investigations and sanctions or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider 

although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data or cyber security incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us a data or cyber security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation while adp maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of data and cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of data and cyber risk 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

a disruption of our data centers could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

we host our applications and serve our clients from data centers that we operate and from data centers operated by thirdparty vendors if any of our or our thirdparty vendors data centers fail or become disabled even for a limited period of time our businesses could be disrupted and we could suffer financial loss liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition in addition our thirdparty vendors may cease providing data center facilities or services elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights it could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

our ability to compete and success depend in part upon our intellectual property we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees customers vendors partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights we may need to devote significant resources including cybersecurity resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights in addition the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or ineffective or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and timeconsuming furthermore our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights which may be successful 

we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights 

there is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry third parties including our competitors may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our products or services and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing upon such rights even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and if successfully asserted against us could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments obtain licenses modify applications prevent us from offering our services or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers vendors or partners in connection with any such claim or litigation even if we were to prevail in such a dispute any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming 

if we fail to upgrade enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish 

we may not realize the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations financial results and competitive position 

we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives which are designed to streamline our organization extend our worldclass distribution and strengthen our talent and culture while supporting our revenue growth margin improvement and productivity if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits improvements may be delayed or not realized and our business operations and competitive position could be adversely affected these initiatives or our failure to successfully manage them could result in unintended consequences or unforeseen costs including distraction of our management and employees attrition inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on hcm services or renegotiating their contracts with us which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or in unison during periods of unusual financial market volatility in addition as part of our client funds investment strategy we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in order to satisfy these shortterm funding requirements we maintain access to various sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may require us to sell client fund assets to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements which may result in the recognition of losses and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll tax and other money movement services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others 

we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders responding to such actions could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our business and operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers vendors investors and other third parties in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability

nm  not meaningful 

note 1 nongaap measures 

in addition to our gaap results we use the adjusted results and other nongaap metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods 

  

we believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations since these adjusted financial measures and other nongaap metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap they should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to their corresponding us gaap measures and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies 



a our adjusted ebit from continuing operations continues to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model the

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

for corporate liquidity we expect existing cash cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities longterm marketable securities and cash flow from operations together with our 98 billion  of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both longterm and shortterm debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends share repurchases and capital expenditures additionally we will benefit from the act we anticipate a future adjusted effective tax rate excluding onetime items of 25 to 26 beyond fiscal 2018 with this increased operating cash flow and greater access to our cash worldwide we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation decisions including assessing reinvestments into the business potential acquisitions andor returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks among other potential uses 

for client funds liquidity we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our us shortterm commercial paper program and our us and canadian shortterm reverse repurchase agreements together with our 98 billion  of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations please see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a further discussion of the risks of our client funds investment strategy see note 9  of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our shortterm financing including commercial paper 

as of june 30 2018  cash and cash equivalents were  22 billion  which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds 

operating investing and financing cash flows 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows for the years ended 2018  2017  and 2016  are summarized as follows 



see note 1 of our consolidated financial statements for a summary of adjustments 

fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017     

net cash flows provided by  operating activities in fiscal 2018   increase d primarily due to growth in our underlying business net income adjusted for noncash adjustments such as the verp in fiscal 2018 and the gain on the sale of cobra and chsa in fiscal 2017 

net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds offset by purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of 6326 million  payments made related to acquisitions in fiscal 2018 and proceeds from the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses of 2340 million  in fiscal 2017  

net cash flows from financing activities changed due to a net increase  in the cash flow from client funds obligations of 64610 million  which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients employees and other payees and less cash paid for share repurchases we purchased approximately 85 million  shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 11607  during fiscal 2018  as compared to purchases of 135 million  shares at an average price per share of 9442  during fiscal 2017  from time to time the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things actual and potential acquisition activity cash balances and cash flows issuances due to employee benefit plan activity and market conditions the increased cash flow from client fund obligations and reduced share repurchases were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders via dividends which increased by 685 million from fiscal 2017 

  

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 

net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our business and favorable changes in our working capital which was due to the timing of payments from our clients and to our vendors in the ordinary course of business 

net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of 14935 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client fund marketable securities of 16218 million 

net cash flows from financing activities changed due to the net decrease in client funds obligations of 149239 million as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds and proceeds from our 20 billion september 2015 debt issuance 

  

we purchased approximately 135 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 9442 during fiscal 2017 as compared to purchases of 138 million shares at an average price per share of 8288 during fiscal 2016 from time to time the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things actual and potential acquisition activity cash balances and cash flows issuances due to employee benefit plan activity and market conditions 

capital resources and client fund obligations 

in fiscal 2016 we issued 20 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025 we may from time to time revisit the longterm debt market to refinance existing debt finance investments including acquisitions for our growth and maintain the appropriate capital structure however there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our longterm financing including this fiscal 2016 debt issuance 

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities this commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to 98 billion  in aggregate maturity value our commercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days in fiscal 2018  and 2017  our average daily borrowings were 28 billion  and 31 billion  respectively at a weighted average interest rate of 14  and 06  respectively the weighted average maturity of our commercial paper during fiscal 2018  and 2017  was approximately two days  at june 30 2018  and 2017  we had no  outstanding obligations under our shortterm commercial paper program 

our us canadian and united kingdom shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations at june 30 2018  and june 30 2017  there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements for fiscal 2018  and 2017  we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of 3744 million  and 2748 million  respectively at weighted average interest rates of 13  and 06  respectively see note 9  of our consolidated financial statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements 

we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility we have a 38 billion  364day credit agreement that matures in june 2019  with a one year termout option in addition we have a fiveyear 375 billion  credit facility and a fiveyear 225 billion  credit facility maturing in june 2023  and june 2022  respectively each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by  500 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes if necessary we had no borrowings through june 30 2018  under the credit facilities we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the 98 billion  available to us under the revolving credit agreements see note 9  of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our shortterm financing including credit facilities 

our investment portfolio does not contain any assetbacked securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages alternativea mortgages subprime auto loans or subprime home equity loans collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations credit default swaps derivatives auction rate securities structured investment vehicles or noninvestment grade fixedincome securities we own aaa rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card auto loan equipment lease and rate reduction receivables secured predominantly by prime collateral all collateral on assetbacked securities is performing as expected in addition we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations see note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2018  were 1920 million as compared to 2491  million for fiscal 2017  we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2019  to be about 250 million 

contractual obligations 

 the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at june 30 2018  



 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services as of june 30 2018  the obligations relating to these matters which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2019  total 274935 million  and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets we had 271378 million  of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2018  

separately adp indemnity paid a premium of 2180 million  in july 2018  to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2019  policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2018  reinsurance policy at june 30 2018  adp indemnity had total assets of 5237 million  to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of 4338 million  for the policy years since july 1 2003 adp indemnity paid claims of  46 million  and 107 million  net of insurance recoveries in fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively refer to the analysis of reportable segments  other above for additional information regarding adp indemnity 

in the normal course of business we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary objectives consistent with those objectives we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 98 billion  commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 p1 by moody’s the highest possible credit ratings our ability to engage in reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our 98 billion  committed credit facilities the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

  



we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased slightly to 19  for fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 8 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2019  a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 4 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2019  

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s dbrs for canadian denominated securities and fitch for assetbacked and commercial mortgage backed securities approximately 80  of our availableforsale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30 2018  in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us government and government agency canadian government and united kingdom government securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30 2018  or 2017  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 new accounting pronouncements of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition   our   revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services payroll processing fees investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services clientrelated funds and fees charged to implement clients on the companys solutions we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

peo provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution including offering benefits providing workers’ compensation insurance and administering state unemployment insurance among other human resources functions amounts collected from peo worksite employers include payroll fees for benefits and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes fees for workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes 

the payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers are presented in revenue net as the company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the peo arrangement with respect to the payroll and payroll taxes the worksite employer is the primary obligor has latitude in establishing price selects suppliers and determines the service specifications 

the fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses as the company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement with respect to the fees for benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes the company is the primary obligor has latitude in establishing price selects suppliers determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk 

we recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on our solutions and are deferred until the client has gone live and services have begun these fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or expected client life including estimated renewals of client contracts 

  

we assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customers payment history 

goodwill  we account for goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 

the company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2018 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using as appropriate the income approach which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and the market approach which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates profitability projections working capital assumptions the weighted average cost of capital the determination of appropriate market comparison companies and terminal growth rates several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade 

enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences as such the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins based upon the quantitative assessment the company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired 

income taxes   the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not” assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2018  and 2017  the companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 452 million  and 746 million  respectively 

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings by up to 2 million  and expected cash payments could be up to 25 million  in the next twelve months the liability related to cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months has been reclassified from other liabilities to current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known

competition 

the industries in which adp operates are highly competitive adp knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of hr outsourcing solutions in the world employer services competes with other business outsourcing companies companies providing erp services providers of cloudbased hcm solutions and financial institutions peo services competes with other peos providing similar services 

as well as business outsourcing companies companies providing erp services and providers of cloudbased hcm solutions other competitive factors include a company’s inhouse function whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems

as one of the world’s largest providers of hr outsourcing solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients employees of our clients vendors and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy and data securityrelated laws including federal state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data the changing nature of privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the adoption by the european union of the general data protection regulation the gdpr will impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients in addition in the united states the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 applies to our insurance services businesses and adp totalsource

clients and client contracts 

adp provides its services to approximately 700000 clients in fiscal 2017  no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2 of adp’s annual consolidated revenues 

adp is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client the installation or conversion period for new clients can vary from a short period of time for a small employer services client as little as 24 hours to a longer period for a large employer services client with multiple deliverables generally six to twelve months in some cases the period may exceed two years for a large globalview client or other large complicated implementation although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business this metric is not a reported number but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients in addition some of our products and services are sold under longer term contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years however this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of adp’s expected future revenue is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not used by management internally to estimate adp’s future revenue 

our business is typically characterized by longterm client relationships that result in recurring revenue our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions no one price quotation or service agreement is material to adp adp’s client retention is estimated at approximately 10 years in employer services and approximately 7 years in peo services and has not varied significantly from period to period 

product development 

adp continually upgrades enhances and expands its solutions and services in general new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and given our recurring revenue model do not have a material and immediate effect on adps revenues adp believes that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles 

systems development and programming 

during the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  2016  and 2015  adp invested approximately 859 million 818 million and 767 million respectively from continuing operations in systems development and programming which includes expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic platforms the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies including purchases of new software and software licenses

number of employees 

adp employed approximately 58000 persons as of june 30 2017  




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k the level of 

importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business 

failure to comply with or changes in laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the laws and regulations described in the “industry regulation” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

in addition changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business health care reform under the affordable care act related state laws and the regulations thereunder as well as pending federal health care legislation have the potential to substantially impact the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for our peo business as well as the demand for our health care compliance solutions we are unable to determine the ultimate impact that health care reform including the pending federal health care legislation will have on our peo business and our ability to attract and retain peo clients or demand for our health care compliance solutions 

amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such existing statutes or regulations could require additional registration or licensing limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed and expose us to financial penalties these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations antimoney laundering laws and regulations economic and trade sanctions and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations any of which which could adversely impact our business we operate our business around the world including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government   officials and leaders of political parties and in some cases to other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations among others in addition some of our businesses in the us and a number of countries in which we operate are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including for example the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2000 the “bsa” among other things the bsa requires certain financial institutions including banks and money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records we have registered our payroll card business with the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to a fincen regulation 

we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations and we are continuously in the process of 

reviewing upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures however there can be no assurance that our employees consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators any violations of applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition further bank regulators are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses as a class to be higher risk customers for money laundering as a result our banking partners may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional requirements on us these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal riskbased policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

the collection hosting transfer disclosure use storage and security of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal state and foreign data privacy laws these laws which are not uniform do one or more of the following regulate the collection transfer including in some cases the transfer outside the country of collection processing storage use and disclosure of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing under certain circumstances some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals data protection authorities andor other regulators in the event of a data breach in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries in addition the european union adopted the comprehensive general data privacy regulation the “gdpr” in may 2016 that will replace the current eu data protection directive and related countryspecific legislation the gdpr will become fully effective in may 2018 complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices further enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

our businesses collect host transfer disclose use store and secure personal and business information and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

in connection with our business we collect host transfer disclose use store and secure large amounts of personal and business information about our clients employees of our clients our vendors and our employees contractors and temporary staff including payroll information health care information personal and business financial data social security numbers and their foreign equivalents bank account numbers tax information and other sensitive personal and business information 

we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes nonetheless globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics code and viruses although this is a global problem it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent third parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect host use transmit and store 

we have programs in place to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data or our systems unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our employees contractors and temporary staff as these threats continue to evolve and 

increase we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities in addition while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients or vendors and in any event third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures 

any cyber attack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service corruption of data theft of nonpublic or other sensitive information or similar act by a malevolent party or inadvertent acts or inactions by our employees contractors or temporary staff could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information and could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients create liability regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider 

although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data security incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us a data security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition while adp maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

a disruption of our data centers could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

we host our applications and serve our clients from data centers that we operate and from data centers operated by thirdparty vendors if any of our or our third party vendors data centers fail or become disabled even for a limited period of time our businesses could be disrupted and we could suffer financial loss liability to clients loss of clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition in addition our third party vendors may cease providing data center facilities or services elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or in unison during periods of unusual financial market volatility in addition as part of our client funds investment strategy we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in order to satisfy these shortterm funding requirements we maintain access to various sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may require us to sell client fund assets to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements which may result in the recognition of losses and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll tax and other money movement services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others 

we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders responding to such actions could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our business and operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers vendors investors and other third parties in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong investmentgrade longterm debt ratings and the highest commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and adversely impact our results of operations 

if the distribution of cdk global® common stock to adp’s stockholders does not qualify as a taxfree spinoff we could incur substantial liabilities and may not be fully indemnified for such liabilities 

on september 30 2014 the company completed the taxfree spinoff of its former dealer services business through the distribution of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of cdk global inc “cdk global” to adp’s stockholders cdk global was formed to hold adp’s former dealer services business and as a result of the distribution became an independent public company trading under the symbol “cdk” on the nasdaq global select market prior to completing the spinoff of cdk global adp received an opinion from paul weiss rifkind wharton  garrison llp its counsel to the effect that based on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings set forth in the opinion the distribution qualified as a transaction that is taxfree under section 355 and other related provisions of the internal revenue code adp also received a private letter ruling from the irs with respect to certain discrete and significant issues arising in connection with the transactions effected in connection with the separation and distribution the opinion and the ruling were based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by adp and cdk global if any of those factual representations or assumptions was untrue or incomplete in any material respect any undertaking is not complied with or the facts upon which the opinion and the ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution the distribution may not qualify for taxfree treatment although a private letter ruling from the irs generally is binding on the irs the irs did not rule that the distribution satisfies every requirement for a taxfree distribution opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or the courts as a result the conclusions expressed in an opinion of counsel could be challenged by the irs and if the irs prevails in such challenge the tax consequences to adp’s stockholders that received cdk global common stock pursuant to the distribution could be materially less favorable 

if the distribution were determined not to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code each united states holder of adp common stock that received cdk global common stock pursuant to the distribution generally would be treated as receiving a distribution taxable as a dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cdk global common stock received by such holder in addition adp generally would recognize gain with respect to the distribution and certain related transactions and cdk global could be required to indemnify adp for any resulting taxes and related expenses which could be material the distribution and certain related transactions could be taxable to adp if cdk global or its stockholders were to engage in certain transactions after the distribution in such cases adp or its stockholders that received cdk global common stock pursuant to the spinoff could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and cdk global could be required to indemnify adp for any resulting taxes and related expenses which could be material cdk global may be unable to indemnify us fully for any such taxes and related expenses 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results of our operations may suffer

highlights from the year ended june 30 2017  fiscal 2017 include 

 

during fiscal 2017  we continued to focus on our global hcm strategy by investing to strengthen our underlying business model and prospects for sustainable longterm growth our robust and diverse product offerings are the result of our continued investment in product innovation and service our results in fiscal 2017 reflect the stability of our underlying business model and our disciplined strategy for profitable growth while maintaining our focus on shareholder friendly actions 

our new business bookings were down 5  during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  due to high demand in fiscal 2016 for our solutions that assist our clients in complying with the affordable care act aca we remain optimistic of our ability to deliver innovative and competitive products as well as our sales forces ability to distribute our products heading into the year ending june 30 2018 fiscal 2018 

 the causes of our client losses and resulting impact on our revenue retention continue to be a point of internal focus our employer services revenue retention was down 50  basis points during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to lower retention on our legacy client platforms coupled with the anticipated loss of a large client within our former chsa business at the beginning of the fiscal year we are seeing strong retention on our strategic platforms we continue to upgrade our clients from legacy platforms to our new cloudbased solutions and focus on improving the client experience we believe upgrading our clients from legacy platforms is an important aspect of our longterm strategy giving our clients our most innovative and seamless products 

our implementation teams ability to implement our services as well as our sales forces ability to sell to clients and prospects drove revenue growth during fiscal 2017  our revenue growth also benefited from the continued increase in our pays per control metric which we measure as the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a samestoresales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of us geographic regions 

during fiscal 2017  we incurred 900 million  in charges for a previously announced multiyear service alignment initiative intended to align our client service operations to our strategic platforms in connection with this service alignment initiative we anticipate incurring total pretax charges of about 30 million  in the year ended june 30 2018  

in november 2016 we completed the sale of our consumer health spending account chsa and consolidated omnibus reconciliation act cobra businesses which resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 205 million  this disposition and subsequent partnership with the acquiring company allows us to further sharpen our focus on our core capabilities while continuing to deliver a full suite of hcm solutions to current and future clients in a seamless fashion the historical results of operations of this business are included in the employer services segment 

in january 2017 we acquired the marcus buckingham company tmbc tmbc is a provider of talent management technology coaching and consulting solutions the acquisition reflects our commitment to innovation and enhances our core hcm capabilities allowing us to deepen our offering in this critical area of talent management the results of operations of this business will be included in the employer services segment 

we have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues good margins the ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows strong client retention and low capital expenditure requirements our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30 2017  with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately 28 billion  

we continue to make investments in our sales force and are pleased with the operational improvements of our organization our ability to continuously innovate and offer new and exciting products to our clients and the ability of our service organization to support these new services and strategic platforms our pipeline for future new business bookings remains strong as we leverage our investments in our strategic platforms and our strong tenured sales force we believe that our focus on these areas will continue to drive our growth and success in the future 

results of operations 

analysis of consolidated operations 

prior period amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations refer to note 3 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in millions except per share amounts 



nm  not meaningful 

note 1 nongaap measures 

in addition to our gaap results we use the adjusted results and other nongaap metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods 

  

  

we believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations against prior period and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations since these adjusted financial measures and other nongaap metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap they should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to their us gaap measures and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies 



a we continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model the adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as all other interest expense and all other interest income 

b the majority of charges relating to our service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort represent severance charges severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results unlike 

severance charges in prior periods these specific charges relate to our broadbased companywide service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort the fiscal 2017 workforce optimization effort adjustment totaling approximately 5 million represents a reversal of the fiscal 2016 estimate 

c the taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment the tax amount was adjusted for a book vs tax basis difference for the year ended june 30 2017  due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business and for the year ended june 30 2016  due to a previously recorded non taxdeductible goodwill impairment charge 

d the tax benefitprovision on the service alignment initiative workforce optimization effort and the gain on the sale of the building was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment 

e the adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our adjusted net earnings from continuing operations plus our adjusted provision for income taxes 

f constant dollar basis provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations constant dollar basis is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

net cash flows provided by  operating activities increase d due to growth in our business and favorable changes in our working capital which was due to the timing of payments from our clients and to our vendors in the ordinary course of business 

net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of 150618 million  as well as the timing of purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of 14935 million  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client fund marketable securities of 16218 million

capital resources and client fund obligations 

in september 2015 we issued 20 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025 we may from time to time revisit the longterm debt market to refinance existing debt finance investments including acquisitions for our growth and maintain the appropriate capital structure however there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our longterm financing including this fiscal 2016 debt issuance 

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities during the majority of fiscal 2017  this commercial paper program provided for the issuance of up to 925 billion  in aggregate maturity value and in june 2017 we increased our commercial paper program to 95 billion  our commercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days in fiscal 2017  and 2016  our average daily borrowings were 31 billion  and 27 billion  respectively at a weighted average interest rate of 06  and 03  respectively the weighted average maturity of the company’s commercial paper 

during fiscal 2017  was approximately two days  at june 30 2017  and 2016 we had no  outstanding obligations under our shortterm commercial paper program 

our us and canadian shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations at june 30 2017  and 2016 there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements for fiscal 2017  and 2016  we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of 2748 million  and 3410 million  respectively at weighted average interest rates of 06  and 04  respectively see note 9  of our consolidated financial statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements 

we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility we have a 35 billion  364day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in june 2018  with a one year termout option in addition we have a fiveyear 375 billion  credit facility and a fiveyear 225 billion  credit facility maturing in june 2021  and june 2022  respectively each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by  500 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes if necessary we had no borrowings through june 30 2017  under the credit agreements we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the 95 billion  available to us under the revolving credit agreements see note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our shortterm financing including credit facilities 

our investment portfolio does not contain any assetbacked securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages alternativea mortgages subprime auto loans or subprime home equity loans collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations credit default swaps derivatives auction rate securities structured investment vehicles or noninvestment grade fixedincome securities we own aaa rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card auto loan equipment lease and rate reduction secured predominately by prime collateral all collateral on assetbacked securities is performing as expected in addition we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks we do own mortgagebacked securities which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages these securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15year and 30year residential mortgages and are guaranteed primarily by federal national mortgage association as to the timely payment of principal and interest our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations see note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients 

capital expenditures for continuing operations for fiscal 2017  were 2491 million as compared to 1657 million  for fiscal 2016  we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2018  to be about 200 million 

contractual obligations 

  the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at june 30 2017  



 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services as of june 30 2017  the obligations relating to these matters which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2018  total 271894 million  and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets we had 272915 million  of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2017  

separately adp indemnity paid a premium of 2350 million  in july 2017  to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2018  policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2017  reinsurance policy at june 30 2017  adp indemnity had total assets of 5339 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of 4597 million for the policy years since july 1 2003 adp indemnity paid claims of 107 million and 140 million net of insurance recoveries in fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively refer to the analysis of reportable segments  other above for additional information regarding adp indemnity 

in the normal course of business we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary objectives consistent with those objectives we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 95 billion  commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 p1 by moody’s the highest possible credit ratings our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreements and available borrowings under our 95 billion  committed credit facilities the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 



  



  

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased slightly to 16  for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 11 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2018  a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 6 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2018  

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dbrs approximately 79  of our availableforsale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30 2017  in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30 2017  or 2016  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 new accounting pronouncements of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition   our   revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services payroll processing fees investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services clientrelated funds and fees charged to implement clients on the companys solutions we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

peo provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution including offering benefits providing workers’ compensation insurance and administering state unemployment insurance among other human resources functions amounts collected from peo worksite employers include payroll fees for benefits and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes fees for workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes 

the payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers are presented in revenue net as the company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the peo arrangement with respect to the payroll and payroll taxes the worksite employer is the primary obligor has latitude in establishing price selects suppliers and determines the service specifications 

the fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses as the company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement with respect to the fees for benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes the company is the primary obligor has latitude in establishing price selects suppliers determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk 

  

we recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on our solutions and are deferred until the client has gone live and services have begun these fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or expected client life including estimated renewals of client contracts 

  

we assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customers payment history 

goodwill  we account for goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable according to asc 350 we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or can directly perform the twostep impairment test based on a qualitative assessment if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test prescribed by asc 350 would be performed 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2017  was performed using a qualitative approach the qualitative assessment considered industry and market considerations for any deterioration in the environment in which we operate the competitive environment a decline both absolute and relative to peers in marketdependent multiples or metrics any changes in the market for our services and regulatory and political development additionally we assessed financial 

performance by reporting unit and considered cost factors such as labor or other costs that would have a negative effect on results the annual goodwill impairment assessments performed for fiscal 2017  have indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is substantially in excess of carrying value and not at risk of failing step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test based on our qualitative assessment the company has determined that goodwill is not impaired 

income taxes   the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not” assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2017  and 2016  the companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 746 million  and 274 million  respectively 

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 35 million  in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

as part of our payroll and payroll tax management services we move client funds to taxing authorities and our clients’ employees via electronic transfer direct deposit prepaid access and adpcheck certain elements of our us money transmission activities including our electronic payment and prepaid access payroll pay card offerings are subject to certain licensing requirements in addition our us prepaid access offering is subject to the antimoney laundering and reporting provisions of the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2000 the “bsa” elements of our money transmission activities outside of the united states are subject to similar licensing and antimoney laundering and reporting laws and requirements in the countries in which we provide such services our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the fair credit reporting act adp totalsource is subject to various state licensing requirements because adp totalsource is a coemployer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees we may be subject to certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax insurance and employment laws 

in addition many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to adp changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations products and services for example our hcm solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act in the united states our cobra administration services and flexible spending account services in the united states are designed to help our clients comply with relevant federal guidelines relating to respectively employers’ benefits continuation obligations and the requirements of section 125 of the internal revenue code similarly our tax credit services business which helps clients in the united states take advantage of tax credit opportunities as they hire new employees is based on federal state or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits 

the foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing and impacting our business see the discussion contained in the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for 

information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

clients and client contracts 

adp provides its services to more than 650000 clients in fiscal 2016 no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2 of adp’s annual consolidated revenues 

adp is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time for a small employer services client as little as 24 hours to a longer period for a large employer services client with multiple deliverables generally six to twelve months and in some cases may exceed two years for a large globalview client or other large complicated implementation although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business this metric is not a reported number but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients in addition some of our products and services are sold under longer term contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years however this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of adp’s expected future revenue is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not used by management internally to estimate adp’s future revenue 

our business is typically characterized by longterm client relationships that result in recurring revenue our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions no one price quotation or service agreement is material to adp adp’s client retention is estimated at approximately 11 years in employer services and approximately 7 years in peo services and has not varied significantly from period to period 

product development 

adp continually upgrades enhances and expands its solutions and services in general new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and given our recurring revenue model do not have a material and immediate effect on adps revenues adp believes that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles 

systems development and programming 

during the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  2015  and 2014  adp invested approximately 818 million 767 million and 686 million respectively from continuing operations in systems development and programming which includes expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic platforms the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies including purchases of new software and software licenses 

licenses 

adp is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases adp’s business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses thirdparty licenses patents trademarks and franchises are not material to adp’s business as a whole 

number of employees 

adp employed approximately 57000 persons as of june 30 2016  




 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the 

qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business 

failure to comply with or changes in laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the laws and regulations described in the “industry regulation” section in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

in addition changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business health care reform under the us patient protection and affordable care act as amended related state laws and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder have the potential to impact substantially the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for the small and midsized businesses that constitute our peo business’s clients and prospects we are unable to determine the ultimate impact that health care reform will have on our peo business and our ability to attract and retain peo clients 

amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such existing statutes or regulations could require additional registration or licensing limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed and expose us to financial penalties these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations antimoney laundering laws and regulations economic and trade sanctions and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations which could adversely impact our business we operate our business around the world including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government   officials and leaders of political parties and in some cases to other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations among others in addition some of our businesses in the us and a number of countries in which we operate are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including for example the bsa among other things the bsa requires certain financial institutions including banks and money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records we have registered our payroll card business with the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to a fincen regulation 

we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations and we are continuously in the process of 

reviewing upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures however there can be no assurance that none of our employees consultants or agents will take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators any violations of applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition further bank regulators are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses as a class to be higher risk customers for money laundering as a result our banking partners may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional requirements on us these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal riskbased policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

the collection hosting transfer disclosure use storage and security of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal state and foreign data privacy laws these laws which are not uniform do one or more of the following regulate the collection transfer including in some cases the transfer outside the country of collection processing storage use and disclosure of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing under certain circumstances some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals data protection authorities andor other regulators in the event of a data breach in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries in addition the european union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation the “gdpr” in may 2016 that will replace the current eu data protection directive and related countryspecific legislation the gdpr will become fully effective in may 2018 we are analyzing the gdpr to determine its potential effects on our business practices and are awaiting anticipated guidance from european union regulators complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices further enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

our businesses collect host transfer disclose use store and secure personal and business information and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

in connection with our business we collect host transfer disclose use store and secure large amounts of personal and business information about our clients employees of our clients our vendors and our employees contractors and temporary staff including payroll information health care information personal and business financial data social security numbers and their foreign equivalents bank account numbers tax information and other sensitive personal and business information 

we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes nonetheless globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics code and viruses although this is a global problem it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent thirdparties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect host use transmit and store 

we have programs in place to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive measures 

in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data or 

our systems unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of thirdparties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other methods of deceiving our employees contractors and temporary staff as these threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities in addition while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients vendors or their respective employees and in any event thirdparties may be able to circumvent those security measures 

any cyber attack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service corruption of data theft of nonpublic or other sensitive information or similar act by a malevolent party or inadvertent acts by our own employees contractors or temporary staff could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information and could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients create financial liability regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider 

although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us a data security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition while adp maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

if we fail to adapt our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences the demand for our solutions and services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or in unison during periods of unusual financial market volatility in addition as part of our client funds investment strategy we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in order to satisfy these short term funding requirements we maintain access to various sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial 

markets or otherwise may require us to sell client fund assets to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements which may result in the recognition of losses and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll tax and other money movement services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong investment grade longterm debt ratings and the highest commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and adversely impact our results of operations 

if the distribution of cdk global® common stock to adp’s stockholders does not qualify as a taxfree spinoff we could incur substantial liabilities and may not be fully indemnified for such liabilities 

on september 30 2014 the company completed the taxfree spinoff of its former dealer services business through the distribution of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of cdk global inc “cdk global” to adp’s stockholders cdk global was formed to hold adp’s former dealer services business and as a result of the distribution became an independent public company trading under the symbol “cdk” on the nasdaq global select market prior to completing the spinoff of cdk global adp received an opinion from paul weiss rifkind wharton  garrison llp its counsel to the effect that based on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings set forth in the opinion the distribution qualified as a transaction that is taxfree under section 355 and other related provisions of the internal revenue code adp also received a private letter ruling from the irs with respect to certain discrete and significant issues arising in connection with the transactions effected in connection with the separation and distribution the opinion and the ruling were based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by adp and cdk global if any of those factual representations or assumptions was untrue or incomplete in any material respect any undertaking is not complied with or the facts upon which the opinion and the ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution the distribution may not qualify for taxfree treatment although a private letter ruling from the irs generally is binding on the irs the irs did not rule that the distribution satisfies every requirement for a taxfree distribution opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or the courts as a result the conclusions expressed in an opinion of counsel could be challenged by the irs and if the irs prevails in such challenge the tax consequences to adp’s stockholders that received cdk global common stock pursuant to the distribution could be materially less favorable 

if the distribution were determined not to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code each united states holder of adp common stock that received cdk global common stock pursuant to the distribution generally would be treated as receiving a distribution taxable as a dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cdk global common stock received by such holder in addition adp generally would recognize gain with respect to the distribution and certain related transactions and cdk global could be required to indemnify adp for any resulting taxes and related expenses which could be material the distribution and certain related transactions could be taxable to adp if cdk global or its stockholders were to engage in certain transactions after the distribution in such cases adp or its stockholders that received cdk global common stock pursuant to the spinoff could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and cdk global could be required to indemnify adp for any resulting taxes and related expenses which could be material cdk global may be unable to indemnify us fully for any such taxes and related expenses 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results of our operations may suffer

executive overview 

we are one of the largest providers of cloudbased human capital management hcm solutions  including payroll talent management human resources and benefits administration and time and attendance management  to employers around the world as a leader in this industry we are focused on driving product innovation enhancing our distribution and service capabilities and assisting our clients with their hcm needs in the face of ever increasing regulatory complexity 

highlights from our 2016  fiscal year include 

 

during the year ended june 30 2016 fiscal 2016  we continued to focus on our global hcm strategy and our results reflect the strength of our underlying business model our success in the market and our focus on growth this focus is evidenced by our investments in product innovation service and our sales force as well as the disposition of the advanced md amd business 

our focus on product innovation the high demand for additional hcm solutions including products that assist businesses in complying with the aca investments in and productivity of our salesforce and continued positive economic growth in the united states of america us led our sales force to deliver strong new business bookings during fiscal 2016  our sales forces ability to sell to new and existing clients as well as our implementation teams ability to implement new clients on our solutions and implement new services to existing clients drove solid revenue growth during fiscal 2016  in the second half of fiscal year 2016  we began to see a contribution to revenue growth from our aca compliance solutions as our upfront investments in selling and implementation of these products in late fiscal 2015  and throughout fiscal 2016  began to translate into recurring revenue 

this revenue growth was apparent within both of our business segments during fiscal 2016  despite pressure on employer services revenues from foreign currency translation revenue retention declined compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to elevated losses on our legacy client platforms this metric continues to be a point of internal focus as we upgrade our clients from legacy platforms to our new modern cloudbased solutions and focus on improving the client experience our revenue growth also benefited from the continued increase in our pays per control metric which we measure as the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a samestoresales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of us geographic regions 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we incurred a 48 million  charge for a broadbased workforce optimization effort undertaken during the period additionally in july 2016 we announced a multiyear service alignment initiative intended to align our client service operations with our platform simplification strategy in connection with this service alignment initiative we anticipate incurring pretax charges of 100 million to 125 million through the year ended june 30 2018 

we have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues good margins the ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows strong client retention and low capital expenditure requirements our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30 2016  with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately  32 billion  additionally during fiscal 2016  we changed our capital structure via the issuance of 2 billion  in senior notes the proceeds of which we have begun to return to shareholders via share repurchases the introduction of longterm debt to our capital structure and the anticipated share repurchases are intended to enhance total shareholder return over the longer term 

fiscal 2016 was another exciting and dynamic year that showcased our agility as we continued to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients and the changing regulatory environment within our hcm industry as evidenced by our ability to respond to the challenges presented by the aca we continue to be pleased with the success of our sales operations our ability to continuously innovate and offer new and exciting products to our clients and the ability of our service organization to adapt to these new services and strategic platforms exiting fiscal 2016 we believe that our efforts during the fiscal year in conjunction with our service alignment initiative announced in july positions us well as we head into fiscal 2017

analysis of consolidated operations 

prior period amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations refer to note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in millions except per share amounts 



nm  not meaningful 

note 1 nongaap measures 

within the tables above and below we use the term constant dollar basis so that certain financial measures can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance the financial results on a constant dollar basis are determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year we believe constant dollar basis provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations our constant dollar results are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to the us gaap measures presented 

the following table reconciles our reported results to adjusted results that exclude our provision for income taxes certain interest amounts the charges related to our workforce optimization effort the gain on the sale of a building and the gain on the sale of our amd business in fiscal 2016 we use certain adjusted results among other measures to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods we believe that the exclusion of these items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations against prior period and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations we believe that these adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance generally the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations specifically we have excluded the impact of certain interest expense as a result of the issuance of our 20 billion  fixedrate notes in september 2015  refer to note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information and interest income from adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes adjusted ebit and have also excluded certain interest expense and certain interest income in prior years for comparability however we continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model the amounts included as adjustments in the table below represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as all other interest expense and all other interest income the charges related to our workforce optimization effort represent severance charges severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results unlike severance charges in prior periods these specific charges relate to a broadbased companywide workforce optimization effort since adjusted ebit adjusted provision for income taxes adjusted net earnings from continuing operations adjusted diluted earnings per share adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations and adjusted ebit margin are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap they should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings from continuing operations and diluted eps from continuing operations and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 



a  the tax on the gain on the sale of the amd business was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment adjusted for a book vs tax basis difference primarily due to a previously recorded non taxdeductible goodwill impairment charge 

b  the tax provisionbenefit on the gain on the sale of the building and the workforce optimization effort was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment 

c  the adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our adjusted net earnings from continuing operations plus our adjusted provision for income taxes 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

total revenues 

our revenues as reported increase d 7  in fiscal 2016  despite two  percentage points of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the disposition of the amd business in september 2015 primarily due to new business started during the past twelve months from new business bookings growth refer to “analysis of reportable segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments employer services and professional employer organization peo services

in september 2015 we issued 20 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025 we may from time to time revisit the longterm debt market to refinance existing debt finance investments including acquisitions for our growth and maintain the appropriate capital structure however there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our longterm financing including this fiscal 2016 debt issuance 

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities during the majority of fiscal 2016  this commercial paper program provided for the issuance of up to 825 billion  in aggregate maturity value and in june 2016 we increased our commercial paper program to

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary objectives consistent with those objectives we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 925 billion  commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 p1 by moody’s the highest possible credit ratings ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreements and available borrowings under our 925 billion  committed credit facilities the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio declined to 16  for fiscal 2016  as compared to 17  for fiscal 2015  a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 13 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2017  a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 7 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2017  

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dbrs approximately 80  of our availableforsale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30 2016  in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we experienced pressure from foreign currency translation on our revenue and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in fiscal 2015 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30 2016  or 2015  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 new accounting pronouncements of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition   our   revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services payroll processing fees investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services clientrelated funds and fees charged to implement clients on the companys solutions we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

peo provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution including offering benefits providing workers’ compensation insurance and administering state unemployment insurance among other human resources functions amounts collected from peo worksite employers include payroll fees for benefits and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes fees for workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes 

the payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers is presented in revenue net as the company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the peo arrangement with respect to the payroll and payroll taxes the worksite employer is the primary obligor has latitude in establishing price selects suppliers and determines the service specifications 

the fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses as the company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement with respect to the fees for benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes the company is the primary obligor has latitude in establishing price selects suppliers determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk 

  

we recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on our solutions and are deferred until the client has gone live and services have begun these fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or expected client life including estimated renewals of client contracts 

  

we assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customers payment history 

goodwill  we account for goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable according to asc 350 we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or can directly perform the twostep impairment test based on a qualitative assessment if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test prescribed by asc 350 would be performed 

our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2016  was performed using a qualitative approach the qualitative assessment considered industry and market considerations for any deterioration in the environment in which we operate the competitive environment a decline both absolute and relative to peers in marketdependent multiples or metrics any changes in the market for our services and regulatory and political development additionally we assessed financial 

performance by reporting unit and considered cost factors such as labor or other costs that would have a negative effect on results the annual goodwill impairment assessments performed for fiscal 2016  have indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is substantially in excess of carrying value and not at risk of failing step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test based on our qualitative assessment the company has determined that goodwill is not impaired 

income taxes   the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not” assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2016  and 2015  the companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 274 million  and 271 million  respectively 

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 2 million  in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

competition 

the industries in which adp operates are highly competitive adp knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of business outsourcing solutions in the world employer services and peo services compete with other independent business outsourcing companies companies providing enterprise resource planning services software companies and financial institutions in addition another competitive factor in the industries in which employer services and peo services operate is a company’s use of thirdparty software applications or a captive inhouse function whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems 

competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on service and product quality reputation ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of services and products and price we believe that adp is competitive in each of these areas and that our commitment to service excellence together with our leadingedge technology distinguishes us from our competitors 

industry regulation 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations in addition many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain laws and regulations that apply to them we have and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our solutions and operations including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs 

as one of the world’s largest providers of business outsourcing solutions our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients employees of our clients vendors and our employees we are therefore subject to compliance obligations under federal state and foreign privacy and data securityrelated laws including in the united states the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 with respect to our cobra business our flexible spending account and insurance services businesses adps advancedmd® and adp totalsource we are also subject to foreign federal and state security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data additionally the changing nature of privacy laws in the united states the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients 

as part of our payroll and payroll tax management services we move client funds to taxing authorities and our clients’ employees via electronic transfer direct deposit and adpcheck certain elements of our us money transmission activities including our electronic payment and prepaid access payroll pay card offerings are subject to certain licensing requirements elements of our money transmission activities outside of the united states are subject to similar laws and requirements in the countries in which we offer such services in addition our us prepaid access payroll card offering is subject to the antimoney laundering and reporting provisions of the bank secrecy act of 1970 our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the fair credit reporting act our peo business adp totalsource is subject to various state licensing requirements because adp totalsource is a coemployer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees we may assume certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax insurance and employment laws 

in addition many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain laws and regulations that apply to them although the laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to adp changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations products and services for example our hcm solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act in the united states our cobra administration services and flexible spending account services in the united states are designed to comply with relevant federal guidelines relating to respectively employers’ benefits continuation obligations and the requirements of section 125 of the internal revenue code similarly our tax credit services business which helps clients in the united states take advantage of tax credit opportunities as they hire new employees is based on federal state or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits 

the foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing and impacting our business see the discussion contained in the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that may decrease our revenues and earnings

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business 

failure to comply with or changes in laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

in addition changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business healthcare reform under the us patient protection and affordable care act as amended related state laws and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder have the potential to impact substantially the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for the small and midsized businesses that constitute our peo business’s clients and prospects we are unable to determine the ultimate impact that healthcare reform will have on our peo business and our ability to attract and retain peo clients amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such existing statutes or regulations could require additional registration or licensing limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed and expose us to financial penalties these occurrences could also require changes to our compliance programs and to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted 

failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences 

regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations such heightened scrutiny could result in more aggressive enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations which could adversely impact our business we operate our business around the world including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government   officials and leaders of political parties and in some cases to other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations 

among others in addition some of our businesses in the us and a number of countries in which we operate are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including for example the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 the “bsa” among other things the bsa requires certain financial institutions including banks and money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records we have registered our payroll card business with the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to a fincen regulation 

we have implemented policies to monitor and address compliance with applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions and antimoney laundering laws and regulations and we are in the process of upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures however there can be no assurance that all of our employees consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible or that our policies will be determined to be adequate by regulators any violations of applicable anticorruption economic and trade sanctions or antimoney laundering laws could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition further bank regulators are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses as a class to be higher risk customers for money laundering as a result our banking partners may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional requirements on us these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal riskbased policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 

our businesses host collect use transmit and store personal and business information and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

in connection with our business we host collect use transmit and store large amounts of personal and business information about our clients employees of our clients vendors and our employees including payroll information healthcare information personal and business financial data social security numbers bank account numbers tax information and other sensitive personal and business information 

we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes nonetheless globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication and the company is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics code and viruses although this is a global problem it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent thirdparties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses host collect use transmit and store 

we have programs in place to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of data or our systems unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of thirdparties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other methods of deceiving our employees contractors and temporary staff as these threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities in addition while our operating environment is designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation of similar safeguards by our clients vendors or their respective employees and in any event thirdparties may be able to circumvent those security measures 

any cyberattack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service corruption of data or theft of nonpublic or other sensitive information similar act by a malevolent party or inadvertent acts by our own employees could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information and could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients create financial liability regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we 

have encountered to date have materially impacted us the impact of a data security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition while adp maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyberrisks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyberrisk 

we are also subject to various federal state and international laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use transmission and security of personal and business information in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries in addition the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to laws that may require notification to regulators clients or employees in the event of a privacy breach these laws continue to develop the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us in addition a reduction in availability of financing during such conditions even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our access to shortterm debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our employer services business 

we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or in unison during periods of unusual financial market volatility 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute automated clearing house and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong longterm debt and the highest commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

if the distribution of cdk common stock to adp’s stockholders does not qualify as a taxfree spinoff we could incur substantial liabilities and may not be fully indemnified for such liabilities 

prior to completing the spinoff of cdk adp received an opinion from paul weiss rifkind wharton  garrison llp its counsel to the effect that based on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings set forth in the opinion the distribution qualified as a transaction that is taxfree under section 355 and other related provisions of the internal revenue code adp also received a private letter ruling from the irs with respect to certain discrete and significant issues arising in connection with the transactions effected in connection with the separation and distribution the opinion and the ruling were based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by adp and cdk if any of those factual representations or assumptions was untrue or incomplete in any material respect any undertaking is not complied with or the facts upon which the opinion and the ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution the distribution may not qualify for taxfree treatment although a private letter ruling from the irs generally is binding on the irs the irs did not rule that the distribution satisfies every requirement for a taxfree distribution opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or the courts as a result the conclusions expressed in an opinion of counsel could be challenged by the irs and if the irs prevails in such challenge the tax consequences to stockholders could be materially less favorable 

if the distribution were determined not to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code each united states holder generally would be treated as receiving a distribution taxable as a dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of our common stock received by the holder in addition adp generally would recognize gain with respect to the distribution and certain related transactions and cdk could be required to indemnify adp for any resulting taxes and related expenses which could be material the distribution and certain related transactions could be taxable to adp if cdk or its stockholders were to engage in certain transactions after the distribution in such cases adp or its stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and cdk could be required to indemnify adp for any resulting taxes and related expenses which could be material cdk may be unable to indemnify us fully for any such taxes and related expenses 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results of our operations may suffer

consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015   increased   7  to 109385 million  as compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 fiscal 2014  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased   10  to 20707 million  as compared to fiscal 2014  and net earnings from continuing operations increased   11  to 13765 million  as compared to fiscal 2014  our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased   12  to 289  in fiscal 2015  as compared to 257  in fiscal 2014  

despite pressure from foreign currency translation and higher selling expenses to support our exceptionally strong new business bookings in our employer services segment our business segment results were solid employer services revenues increased 5  to 88973 million  and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 7  to 26942 million  peo services revenues increasing 17  to 26472 million  and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 30  to 3036 million  in fiscal 2015  total new business bookings grew 13 worldwide to over 16 billion in fiscal 2015  our key business metrics continue to reflect the core strength of our business model with our employer services worldwide client revenue retention rate remaining strong at 914 and our pays per control increasing 30 in fiscal 2015 

although interest on funds held for clients increased for the first time in seven years to 3777 million  in fiscal 2015 from 3734 million  in fiscal 2014  we still felt the pressure from declining interest rates on our client funds investment portfolio this decline in the average interest rate earned to 17  in fiscal 2015  as compared to 18  in fiscal 2014  was more than offset by growth in average client funds balances of 5  resulting from the continued strength and growth of our employer services segment 

we invest our funds held for clients in accordance with adps prudent and conservative investment guidelines where the safety of principal liquidity and diversification are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy the portfolio is predominantly invested in aaaaa rated fixedincome securities our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of   the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations

we have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues with strong client retention good margins the ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows and low capital expenditure requirements we continue to enhance value to our shareholders and in fiscal 2015  paid dividends of 9276 million  and returned 15572 million  in cash through our share buyback program these share repurchases were partially funded by the 8250 million dividend we received 

from cdk earlier this fiscal year in the last five fiscal years we have reduced our common stock outstanding by approximately 5 through share buybacks net of the effect of common stock issued under employee stockbased compensation programs we have also raised the quarterly dividend per share for 40 consecutive years

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a shortterm commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of commercial paper rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities during fiscal 2015 this commercial paper program provided for the issuance of up to 75 billion  in aggregate maturity value in july 2015  we increased our us shortterm commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to 825 billion  in aggregate maturity value our commercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days for fiscal 2015  and 2014  our average daily borrowings were 23 billion  at a weighted average interest rate of 01  the weighted average maturity of the company’s commercial paper during fiscal 2015  was approximately two days  we have successfully borrowed through the use of our commercial paper program on an as needed basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations at june 30 2015  we had no  outstanding obligations under our shortterm commercial paper program at june 30 2014  we had 22 billion  of commercial paper outstanding which was repaid on july 1 2014  

our us and canadian shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days we 

have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations at june 30 2015  and 2014  there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements for fiscal 2015  and 2014  we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of 4212 million  and 3617 million  respectively at weighted average interest rates of 04  and 05  respectively in addition we have 325 billion  available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the committed reverse repurchase agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the 325 billion  available to us under the committed reverse repurchase agreements 

we have a 275 billion  364day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in june 2016  in addition we have a fiveyear 225 billion  credit facility and a fiveyear 325 billion  credit facility maturing in june 2020  and june 2019  respectively each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by  5000 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments the interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to libor the effective federal funds rate or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing the company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes if necessary we had no borrowings through june 30 2015  under the credit agreements we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the 825 billion  available to us under the revolving credit agreements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other 

corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary objectives consistent with those objectives we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents at june 30 2015  approximately 93 of the availableforsale securities categorized as us treasury and direct obligations of us government agencies were invested in senior unsecured noncallable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 825 billion  commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 p1 by moody’s the highest possible credit ratings our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions  325 billion  of which is available on a committed basis and available borrowings under our 825 billion  committed credit facilities the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 



  



  

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio remained consistent at 17  for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014 a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 12 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2016 a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 4 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2016 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service approximately 80  of our availableforsale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30 2015  in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we experienced pressure from foreign currency translation on our revenue and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in fiscal 2015 and expect this pressure to continue in the early part of fiscal 2016  we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30 2015  or 2014

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition   our   revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services payroll processing fees investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services clientrelated funds and fees charged to implement clients on the companys solutions we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

we report peo revenues net of direct passthrough costs which are costs billed and incurred for peo services worksite employees primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes benefits workers compensation and state unemployment tax fees for worksite employees are included in peo revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses 

we recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on our solutions and are deferred until the client has gone live and services have begun these fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or expected client life including estimated renewals of client contracts 

we assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customers payment history 

goodwill  we account for goodwill in accordance with asc 35010 which states that goodwill should not be amortized but instead tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount if the carrying value for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment if any we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach which combines the income approach which is the present value of expected cash flows discounted at a riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and the market approach which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates profitability projections working capital assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital the determination of appropriate market comparison companies and terminal growth rates we had 17935 million  of goodwill as of june 30 2015  based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2015  management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units and that no reporting units were at risk of goodwill impairment in completing the annual impairment test for fiscal 2015  we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth synergies andor cost savings associated with our acquisitions in fiscal 2014  the company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there were no impairments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 there was an impairment charge of 427 million for the adp advancedmd reporting unit 

income taxes   the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not” assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2015  and 2014  the companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 271 million  and 565 million  respectively 

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 5 million in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business 

changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations changes in laws or governmental regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees changes in taxation requirements in the united states or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business health care reform under the affordable care act as amended related state laws and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder have the potential to impact substantially the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for the small and midsized businesses that comprise adp totalsources clients and prospects we are unable to determine the ultimate impact that health care reform will have on our peo business and our ability to attract and retain peo clients amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to receive licenses in some jurisdictions and the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions as well as changes in the interpretation of existing statutes in the future could require additional registration or licensing as well as possible changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or our client funds investment strategy 

our businesses host collect use and store personal information about our clients and employees of our clients and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

a number of our businesses host collect use and store large amounts of personal information about our clients and employees of our clients including payroll information healthcare information personal and business financial data social security numbers bank account numbers tax information and other sensitive personal and business information in addition we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business we are focused on ensuring our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information and although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us the impact of a breach could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are also subject to various laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use and security of personal and business information the future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses in addition the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to laws that may require notification to clients or employees of a privacy breach 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication although this is a global problem it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent third parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses host collect use and store any cyber attack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption denial of service corruption of data or theft of nonpublic or other sensitive information or similar act by a malevolent party could create financial liability regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider as these threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities in addition while our operating environment is designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information we do not have the ability to 

monitor the implementation of similar safeguards by our clients vendors or their respective employees and in any event third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us in addition a reduction in availability of financing during such conditions even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our access to shortterm debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our employer services business 

we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or in unison during periods of unusual financial market volatility 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute automated clearing house and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong longterm debt and the highest commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

our proposed spinoff of our dealer services business is subject to inherent risks 

the proposed spinoff of our dealer services business is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties including among others risks that the spinoff will not be consummated increased demands on our management team to accomplish the spinoff and significant transaction costs and risks from changes in the results of operations of our reportable segments 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results of our operations may suffer

executive overview 

  on april 10 2014 we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to separate our dealer services business into an independent publicly traded company through a taxfree spinoff of 100 of dealer services to adp shareholders we expect to receive at least 700 million in connection with the spinoff which we plan to return to our shareholders after the spinoff through share repurchases depending upon market conditions following the spinoff we intend to increase the dividend annually subject to board of director approval keeping intact our 39year track record of consecutive dividend increases however we expect to grow the dividend at a slower rate than earnings to allow us to return to our preseparation target dividend payout ratio of 55 to 60 in about two years we believe that the separation of the dealer services business will allow both companies to focus on their respective businesses industries and strategic opportunities and we will further direct our attention and resources to our mission and three strategic pillars discussed below we expect to complete the separation by october 2014 

adps mission is to help organizations unlock their business potential with our insightful solutions we seek to embrace new technology and innovation to deliver market leading products and services that meet the needs of our clients across all of our markets our commitment to service excellence lies at the core of our relationship with each of our clients whether a small midsized or large organization in one or multiple countries our business strategy is based on strategic pillars which are predicated on our ability to drive innovation and service excellence and attract build and retain the right talent to position adp as the global market leader in human capital management hcm services our strategic pillars are to 

 our results during fiscal 2014  continue to reflect the strength of our underlying business model including the diversity of our client base and products our focus on product innovation and improvements in salesforce productivity led to growth in new business bookings we are pleased with the performance of our business segments which have continued to drive good revenue growth and pretax margin expansion revenue retention improved across our business segments and we continue to benefit from the strength of our pays per control metric which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a samestoresales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of us geographic regions during fiscal 2014 we were impacted by the decline in highmargin client interest revenues as a result of lower interest rates partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance we expect this highmargin client interest revenue to increase in the fiscal year ending june 30 2015 but at a slower rate than our underlying processing revenue 

consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014   increased   8  to 122065 million  as compared to fiscal 2013  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased   10  to 22746 million  as compared to fiscal 2013  and net earnings from continuing operations increased   11  to 15026 million  as compared to fiscal 2013  our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased   11  to 311  in fiscal 2014  as compared to 279  in fiscal 2013  

 our fiscal 2014 results include 149 million  of incremental costs directly attributable to our planned separation of our dealer service business and our fiscal 2013  results include a 427 million  non taxdeductible goodwill impairment charge related to our adp advancedmd business excluding these items our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increase d 8  to 22895 million  as compared to 21188 million  for fiscal 2013  and net earnings from continuing operations increase d 8  to 15175 million  compared to 14008 million  for fiscal 2013  our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increase d 9  to 314  for fiscal 2014  from 288  as adjusted for fiscal 2013  due to increased adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and fewer shares outstanding 

our business segment results were solid with employer services revenues increasing 8  to 85352 million  and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 14  to 25178 million  peo services revenues increasing 15  to 22709 million  and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 17  to 2343 million  and dealer services revenues increasing 7  to 19514 million  and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 14  to 4281 million  in fiscal 2014  employer services and peo services new business bookings which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients grew 7 worldwide to over 14 billion in fiscal 2014  dealer services new business bookings showed strength as we continued to experience the effects of a stronger automotive industry and increased penetration of applications within our base our key business metrics continue to reflect the core strength of our business model with our employer services worldwide client revenue retention rate increasing to an alltime high of 914 and our pays per control metric increased 28 for the twelve months ended june 30 2014  from the twelve months ended june 30 2013 

interest on funds held for clients decreased approximately 11  or 472 million  to 3737 million  from 4209 million  in fiscal 2013  the decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease  in the average interest rate earned to 18  in fiscal 2014  as compared to 22  in fiscal 2013  partially offset by growth in average client funds balance of 8  resulting from the continued strength and growth of our employer services segment 

we invest our funds held for clients in accordance with adps prudent and conservative investment guidelines where the safety of principal liquidity and diversification are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy the portfolio is predominantly invested in aaaaa rated fixedincome securities our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations 

  

our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30 2014  with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of 41 billion  of which 22 billion  related to outstanding commercial paper borrowings these borrowings were a normal part of our client funds extended investment strategy our net cash flows provided by  operating activities were 18214 million  in fiscal 2014  as compared to 15772 million  in fiscal 2013  this increase  in cash flows provided by  operating activities from fiscal 2013  to fiscal 2014  was due to higher net earnings in fiscal 2014  favorable changes in timing differences on the net components of working capital and lower pension contributions the increase in cash provided by  investing activities of 23917 million  is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations partially offset by the timing of purchases and sales of corporate and client fund marketable securities the increase  in cash used in  financing activities of 25092 million  is primarily due to the timing of cash received from items such as proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and payments made related to client funds as compared to the prior year 

we have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues excellent margins the ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows strong client retention and low capital expenditure requirements we continue to enhance value to our shareholders and in fiscal 2014  returned excess cash of 8831 million  through dividends and 6673 million  through our share buyback program in the last five fiscal years we have reduced the companys common stock outstanding by approximately 4  through share buybacks net of the effect of common stock issued under employee stockbased compensation programs we have also raised the dividend payout per share for 39 consecutive years

in fiscal 2015 as a result of the planned separation of our dealer services business we expect to receive a dividend of at least 700 million which we plan to return to our shareholders after the spinoff through share repurchases depending upon market conditions   additionally in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we expect to monetize notes receivables related to our dealer services financing arrangements which is expected to generate between 195 million and 205 million of cash 

  

our principal sources of liquidity for operations are derived from cash generated through operations and through corporate cash and marketable securities on hand we continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2014  and we held approximately 41 billion  of cash and marketable securities at june 30 2014  which included 22 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to our commercial paper borrowings we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our us shortterm commercial paper program and our us and canadian shortterm reverse repurchase agreements to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations included in our cash and cash equivalents as of june 30 2014 is 08 billion  held by our foreign subsidiaries amounts held by foreign subsidiaries if repatriated to the us would generally be subject to foreign withholding and us income taxes adjusted for foreign tax credits our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows for the years ended 2014  2013  and 2012  are summarized as follows 



net cash flows provided by  operating activities were 18214 million  for fiscal 2014  as compared to  15772 million  for fiscal 2013  the increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was due to 1101 million  higher net earnings in fiscal 2014  a lower pension contribution of 506 million and a favorable change in the remaining components of net working capital for the year ended june 30 2014 other operating activities include a 499 million use of funds and financing activities include a 499 million source of funds for excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation for the year ended june 30 2013 other operating activities include a 162 million use of funds and financing activities include a 162 million source of funds for excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

net cash flows provided by  investing activities were  8133 million  for fiscal 2014  as compared to net cash flows used in  investing activities of  15784 million  for fiscal 2013  the net change in cash provided by  investing activities is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of 26988 million  and a decrease  in the purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of 14877 million  partially offset by the a decrease  in proceeds from sales and maturities of corporate and clients funds marketable securities of 15791 million  

net cash flows used in  financing activities were  23582 million  for fiscal 2014  as compared to net cash flows provided by  financing activities of  1510 million  for fiscal 2013  the net change in cash provided by financing activities is due to the net decrease in client funds obligations of 41280 million  as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds and the timing of our borrowings and repayments of our reverse repurchase obligations partially offset by the net increase in proceeds from commercial paper borrowings of 21730 million  

  

we purchased approximately 90 million  shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 7506  during fiscal 2014  compared to purchases of 104 million  shares at an average price per share of 6189  during fiscal 2013  from time to time the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things actual and potential acquisition activity cash balances and cash flows issuances due to employee benefit plan activity and market conditions 

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a shortterm commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to 725 billion  in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities in july 2014 we increased our us shortterm commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to 75 billion in aggregate maturity value our commercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days for fiscal 2014  and 2013  our average borrowings were 23 billion  and 24 billion  respectively at weighted average interest rate of 01  and 02  respectively the weighted average maturity of the company’s commercial paper during fiscal 2014  approximated two days  we have successfully borrowed through the use of our commercial paper program on an as needed basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations at june 30 2014  we had 22 billion  of commercial paper outstanding which was subsequently repaid on july 1 2014  at june 30 2013  we had no  outstanding obligations under our shortterm commercial paper program 

our us and canadian shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet shortterm funding

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary objectives consistent with those objectives we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents at june 30 2014  approximately 92 of the availableforsale securities categorized as us treasury and direct obligations of us government agencies were invested in senior unsecured noncallable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 75 billion  commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 p1 by moody’s the highest possible credit ratings our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions  325 billion  of which is available on a committed basis and available borrowings under our 75 billion committed revolving credit facilities the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 



  



  

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio decrease d from 21  for fiscal 2013  to 17  for fiscal 2014  a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 10 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30   2015  a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 5 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30   2015  

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service approximately 82  of our availableforsale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30 2014  in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance asu 201409 requires an entity to recognize revenue depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 will also result in enhanced revenue related disclosures asu 201409 is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 we have not yet determined the impact of asu 201409 on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in april 2014 the fasb issued asu 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity asu 201408 requires that a disposal representing a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s financial results or a business activity classified as held for sale should be reported as discontinued operations asu 201408 also expands the disclosure requirements for discontinued operations and adds new disclosures for individually significant dispositions that do not qualify as discontinued operations asu 201408 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after december 15 2014 the impact of asu 201408 is dependent upon the nature of dispositions if any after adoption 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu 201311 “presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists” asu 201311 requires netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax position asu 201311 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 retrospective adoption is permitted the adoption of asu 201311 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in july 2013 we adopted asu 201302 “comprehensive income topic 220 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income” asu 201302 requires entities to disclose the amount of income loss reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to each respective line item on the income statement the guidance allows companies to elect whether to disclose the reclassification either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements including crossreferencing other disclosures which provide additional details about these amounts we have elected to disclose the reclassification in the notes to the financial statements with crossreferences to other disclosures which provide additional details about the amounts the adoption of asu 201302 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition  our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services and peo services payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services clientrelated funds peo revenues are reported net of direct passthrough costs which are costs billed and incurred for peo services worksite employees primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes benefits workers compensation and state unemployment tax fees for worksite employees are included in peo revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

  

we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses  eg  dealer services dealer management systems for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

we assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customers payment history we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 

goodwill  we account for goodwill in accordance with asc 35010 which states that goodwill should not be amortized but instead tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount if the carrying value for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment if any we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach which combines the income approach which is the present value of expected cash flows discounted at a riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and the market approach which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates profitability projections working capital assumptions the weightedaverage cost of capital the determination of appropriate market comparison companies and terminal growth rates we had 31138 million  of goodwill as of june 30 2014  based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2014  management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units and that no reporting units were at risk of goodwill impairment in completing the annual impairment test for fiscal 2014  we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth synergies andor cost savings associated with our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 there was an impairment charge of 427 million for the adp advancedmd reporting unit 

income taxes   the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not” assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2014  and 2013  the companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 567 million  and 707 million  respectively 

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 10 million in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

stockbased compensation   we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee 

exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

 item 1a risk factors 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business 

changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings 

our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations changes in laws or governmental regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations by a regulatory authority may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees changes in taxation requirements in the united states or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business health care reform under the affordable care act as amended related state laws and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder have the potential to impact substantially the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for the small and midsized businesses that comprise adp totalsources clients and prospects we are unable to determine the ultimate impact that health care reform will have on our peo business and our ability to attract and retain peo clients amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to receive licenses in some jurisdictions and the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions as well as changes in the interpretation of existing statutes in the future could require additional registration or licensing as well as possible changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or our client funds investment strategy 

cybersecurity and privacy breaches may hurt our business damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

our systems and networks store personal information about our clients and employees of our clients in addition our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans we have security systems and information technology infrastructure in place designed to protect against unauthorized access to such information however there is still a risk that the security systems and infrastructure that we maintain may not be successful in protecting against all security breaches and cyber attacks third parties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business litigation regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely affect the growth of our business 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation 

many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us in addition a reduction in availability of financing during such conditions even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our access to shortterm debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our employer services business 

we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or in unison during periods of unusual financial market volatility 

we are dependent upon various large banks to execute automated clearing house and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest longterm debt and commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results of our operations may suffer

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals consistent with those goals we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents at june 30 2013  approximately 91 of the availableforsale securities categorized as us treasury and direct obligations of us government agencies were invested in senior unsecured noncallable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks 

  

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our  675 billion  commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 p1 by moody’s the highest possible credit ratings our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions  30 billion  of which is available on a committed basis and available borrowings under our 725 billion committed revolving credit facilities in august 2013  the company increased the us shortterm commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to 725 billion  in aggregate maturity value the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a1 andor p1 money market funds must be rated aaaaaamf 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 



  



  

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decrease d approximately 60  basis points from 26  for fiscal   2012  to 21  for fiscal   2013  a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 6 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2014  a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 3 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2014  

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service approximately 83  of our availableforsale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30 2013  in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition  our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services clientrelated funds we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

  

we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses  eg  dealer services dealer management systems for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

we assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customers payment history we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 

goodwill  we account for goodwill in accordance with asc 35010 which states that goodwill should not be amortized but instead tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount if the carrying value for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment if any we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach which combines the income approach which is the present value of expected cash flows discounted at a riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and the market approach which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates profitability projections working capital assumptions the weighted average cost of capital the determination of appropriate market comparison companies and terminal growth rates we had 30526 million  of goodwill as of june 30 2013  based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2013  management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units with the exception of the adp advancedmd reporting unit for which an impairment charge of 427 million  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 in completing the annual impairment test for fiscal 2013  we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth synergies andor cost savings associated with our acquisitions 

income taxes   the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not” assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2013  and 2012  the companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 707 million  and 847 million  respectively 

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 15 million in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

stockbased compensation   we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee 

exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

 item 1a risk factors 

  our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires reference in this section to “we” “our” “us” or similar terms means adp together with its subsidiaries the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business 

changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings 

  portions of adp’s business are subject to governmental regulations changes in laws or governmental regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees changes in taxation requirements in the united states or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business 

cybersecurity and privacy breaches may hurt our business damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

  our systems and networks store personal information about our clients and employees of our clients in addition our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans we have security systems and information technology infrastructure in place designed to protect against unauthorized access to such information however there is still a risk that the security systems and infrastructure that we maintain may not be successful in protecting against all security breaches and cyber attacks third parties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business litigation regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely affect the growth of our business 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation 

  many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation we have disaster recovery business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

  our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

  trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us in addition a reduction in availability of financing during such conditions even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our access to shortterm debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our employer services business 

  we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or in unison during periods of unusual financial market volatility 

  we are dependent upon various large banks to execute automated clearing house and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

  we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

  the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest longterm debt and commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

  our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results of our operations may suffer

during the year ended june 30 2012 “fiscal 2012” we achieved solid results that reflect the strength and resilience of our underlying business model despite the challenges posed by the current economic environment our focus on product innovation and our investment in sales associate headcount has led to growth in new business sales and solid revenue retention across our business segments we are pleased with the current performance of our strategic acquisitions together with the continued strength in our samestoresales growth however we continue to be impacted by the decline in highmargin client interest revenues as a result of lower interest rates partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance we expect the lower interest rates to continue to impact us during the year ending june 30 2013 “fiscal 2013” 

consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012 increased 8 to 106652 million as compared to 98795 million for the year ended june 30 2011 “fiscal 2011” earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10 to 21221 million as compared to 19327 million in fiscal 2011 and net earnings from continuing operations increased 11 to 13885 million as compared to 12542 million in fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12 to 282 in fiscal 2012 from 252 per share in fiscal 2011 on fewer shares outstanding our results for the year included a gain on the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a thirdparty expense management platform of 660 million or 412 million after tax which contributed to increasing our diluted eps from continuing operations 3 or 008 per share 

each of our business segments has continued to demonstrate core strength employer services’ revenues increased 7 to 75677 million peo services’ revenues increased 15 to 17714 million and dealer services’ revenues increased 10 to 16837 million in fiscal 2012 our employer services’ pays per control metric which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a samestoresales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of us geographic regions increased 30 for the twelve months ended june 30 2012 our worldwide client revenue retention rate remained strong throughout the year ending at 91

consolidated interest on funds held for clients decreased approximately 9 or 468 million to 4933 million from 5401 million in fiscal 2011 the decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 28 in fiscal 2012 as compared to 32 in fiscal 2011 partially offset by growth in average client funds balances of 6 due to our positive employer services metrics 

the safety of principal liquidity and diversification of our clients’ funds are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy we continue to promote this strategy by investing in a prudent and conservative manner in accordance with our investment guidelines with a predominant focus on aaaaa securities we do not hold direct investments in sovereign debt issued by greece ireland italy portugal or spain our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations

other income net 

 other income net increased 542 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 this increase was due to a gain of 660 million pertaining to the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a thirdparty expense management platform during fiscal 2012 this increase was partially offset by the net activity related to our availableforsale securities including realized gains realized losses and impairment losses which together resulted in a decrease in other income net of 158 million and a decrease in interest income on corporate funds of 36 million during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulted from lower average interest rates from 26 for fiscal 2011 to 21 for fiscal 2012 partially offset by increasing average daily corporate funds which increased from 35 billion for fiscal 2011 to 40 billion for fiscal 2012 in addition in the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed the sale of two buildings previously classified as assets held for sale for their combined carrying value of 69 million net of selling costs we had previously recorded impairment charges related to these two buildings of 22 million and 117 million during fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively

provision for income taxes the effective tax rates in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were 346 and 351 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year is the result of the final resolution of certain tax matters the expiration of certain statutes of limitation and the availability of foreign tax credits partially offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings between jurisdictions

the following table reconciles our results for fiscal 2012 to adjusted results that exclude the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a thirdparty expense management platform we use certain adjusted results among other measures to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by us and improves our ability to understand our operating performance since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap they should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for earnings from continuing operations and diluted eps from continuing operations and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

net earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations net earnings from continuing operations increased 469 million to 12542 million in fiscal 2011 from 12073 million in fiscal 2010 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5 to 252 the increase in net earnings in fiscal 2011 reflects the increase in earnings before income taxes and the impact of the tax matters discussed above the increase in diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 reflects the increase in earnings and the impact of the tax matters discussed above coupled with the effects of fewer shares outstanding 

the following table reconciles our results for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to adjusted results that exclude the impact of certain favorable tax items we use certain adjusted results among other measures to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by us and improves our ability to understand our operating performance since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap they should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for earnings from continuing operations and diluted eps from continuing operations and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 

 net earnings from continuing operations as adjusted increased 591 million to 12542 million for fiscal 2011 from 11951 million for fiscal 2010 and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as adjusted increased 015 to 252 the increase in diluted earnings per share as adjusted for the fiscal 2011 reflects the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of approximately 142 million shares during fiscal 2011 and the repurchase of 182 million shares in fiscal 2010

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals consistent with those goals we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents at june 30 2012 approximately 92 of the availableforsale securities categorized as us treasury and direct obligations of us government agencies were invested in senior unsecured noncallable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks federal farm credit banks fannie mae and freddie mac 

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 675 billion commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 p1 by moody’s the highest possible credit rating our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions 30 billion of which is available on a committed basis and available borrowings under our 675 billion committed revolving credit facilities however the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb for assetbacked securities is aaa and for municipal bonds is a the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years commercial paper and time deposits must be rated a1p1 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

 we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased 50 basis points from 31 for fiscal 2011 to 26 for fiscal 2012 a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates  eg  overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 10 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2013 a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2013 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service at june 30 2012 approximately 84 of our availableforsale securities held an aaa or aa rating in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities and securities carrying their guarantee 

we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 

during fiscal 2010 we were exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on us dollar denominated shortterm intercompany amounts payable by a canadian subsidiary to a us subsidiary of the company in the amount of 1786 million us dollars in order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar the canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract which obligated the canadian subsidiary to buy 1786 million us dollars at a rate of 115 canadian dollars to each us dollar on december 1 2009 upon settlement of such contract on december 1 2009 an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the canadian subsidiary to buy 294 million us dollars at a rate of 106 canadian dollars to each us dollar on february 26 2010 the net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of 158 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency marktomarket gains on the related shortterm intercompany amounts payable the shortterm intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the canadian subsidiary to the us subsidiary by february 2010

revenue recognition  our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services’ payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services’ clientrelated funds we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses eg dealer services’ dealer management systems for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

we assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 

goodwill  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with asc 35010 which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount if an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment if any we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach which combines the income approach which is the present value of expected cash flows discounted at a riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and the market approach which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business we had 31553 million of goodwill as of june 30 2012 based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units in completing the annual impairment test for fiscal 2012 we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth synergies andor cost savings associated with our acquisitions 

income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically the likelihood of an entity’s tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not” assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2012 and 2011 the company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 847 million and 1057 million respectively 

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 10 million in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

stockbased compensation we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

clients and client contracts 

 

  adp provides its services to about 570000 clients in fiscal 2011 no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2 of annual consolidated revenues 

 

  our business is typically characterized by longterm client relationships that result in recurring revenue adp is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time as little as 24 hours for an sbs client to a longer period generally six to twelve months for a national account services or dealer services client with multiple deliverables and in some cases may exceed two years for a large globalview client or other large complicated implementation although we monitor sales that have not yet been billed or installed we do not view this metric as material in light of the recurring nature of our business this is not a reported number but it is used by management as a planning tool relating to resources needed to install services and a means of assessing our performance against the installation timing expectations of our clients 

 

  adp’s average client retention is estimated at approximately 11 years in employer services approximately 6 years in peo services and 16 or more years in dealer services and has not varied significantly from period to period

 item 1a risk factors 

 

  our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires reference in this section to “we” “ours” “us” or similar terms means adp together with its subsidiaries the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business 

 

changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings 

 

  portions of adp’s business are subject to governmental regulations changes in laws or governmental regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees changes in taxation requirements in the united states or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income changes in laws that govern the coemployment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business 

 

security and privacy breaches may hurt our business 

 

  we store electronically personal information about our clients and employees of our clients in addition our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans we have security systems and procedures in place that are designed to protect against any unauthorized access to such information however there is still a risk that the security systems and procedures that we maintain may not be successful in protecting against all security breaches any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and the growth of our business could be adversely affected 

  

 

 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation 

 

  many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation we have disaster recovery plans in place to protect our businesses against natural disasters security breaches military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

 

  our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

  trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us in addition the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our access to shortterm debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our employer services business 

 

  we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated individually or in unison during periods of unusual financial market volatility 

 

  we are dependent upon various large banks to execute automated clearing house and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

 

  we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income from affiliates operating in nonus dollar currency environments and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

 

  the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest longterm debt and commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

 

 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

 

  our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results from our operations may suffer

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals consistent with those goals we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents at june 30 2011 approximately 93 of the availableforsale securities categorized as us treasury and direct obligations of us government agencies were invested in senior unsecured noncallable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks federal farm credit banks freddie mac and fannie mae 

 

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 

 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 675 billion commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 p1 by moody’s the highest possible credit rating our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions 2 billion of which is available on a committed basis and available borrowings under our 675 billion committed revolving credit facilities in august 2011 the company increased the us shortterm commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to 675 billion in aggregate maturity value however the availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate bonds is bbb and for assetbacked and commercial mortgagebacked securities is aaa the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years commercial paper must be rated a1p1 and for time deposits banks must have a financial strength rating of c or better 

 

 

 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased by 30 basis points from 34 for fiscal 2010 to 31 for fiscal 2011 a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates  eg  overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 9 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2012 a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 3 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2012 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service at june 30 2011 approximately 86 of our availableforsale securities held an aaa or aa rating in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 

 

during fiscal 2010 we were exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on us dollar denominated shortterm intercompany amounts payable by a canadian subsidiary to a us subsidiary of the company in the amount of 1786 million us dollars in order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar the canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract which obligated the canadian subsidiary to buy 1786 million us dollars at a rate of 115 canadian dollars to each us dollar on december 1 2009 upon settlement of such contract on december 1 2009 an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the canadian subsidiary to buy 294 million us dollars at a rate of 106 canadian dollars to each us dollar on february 26 2010 the net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of 158 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency marktomarket gains on the related shortterm intercompany amounts payable the shortterm intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the canadian subsidiary to the us subsidiary by february 2010

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition  our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services’ payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services’ clientrelated funds we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

 

we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses eg dealer services’ dealer management systems for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

 

we assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 

 

goodwill  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with asc 35010 which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount if an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment if any we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach which utilizes a discounted cash flow model in addition we use comparative market multiples to corroborate our discounted cash flow results we had 30736 million of goodwill as of june 30 2011 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth synergies andor cost savings associated with our acquisitions 

 

income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 

there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically the likelihood of an entity’s tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not” assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2011 and 2010 the company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 1057 million and 1072 million respectively 

 

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 100 million in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

 

stockbased compensation we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies 

 

a basis of preparation the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto of automatic data processing inc and its subsidiaries “adp” or the “company” have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets liabilities revenue costs expenses and accumulated other comprehensive income that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto actual results may differ from those estimates 

 

b description of business the company is a provider of technologybased outsourcing solutions to employers and vehicle retailers and manufacturers the company classifies its operations into the following reportable segments employer services professional employer organization “peo” services and dealer services the primary components of the “other” segment are miscellaneous processing services such as customer financing transactions nonrecurring gains and losses results of operations of adp indemnity and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments such as stockbased compensation expense 

 

c revenue recognition revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg employer services’ payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services’ clientrelated funds the company enters into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties 

 

interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

 

the company also recognizes revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses eg dealer services’ dealer management systems for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist 

 

the company assesses collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history 

 

peo revenues are reported on the statements of consolidated earnings and are reported net of direct passthrough costs which are costs billed and incurred for peo services worksite employees primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes benefits workers’ compensation and state unemployment tax fees for worksite employees are included in peo revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses 

 

d cash and cash equivalents investment securities with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value 

 

e corporate investments and funds held for clients all of the company’s marketable securities are considered to be “availableforsale” and accordingly are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value unrealized gains and losses net of the related tax effect are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets until realized realized gains and losses from the sale of availableforsale securities are determined on a specificidentification basis and are included in other income net on the statements of consolidated earnings 

 

 

 

if the fair value of an availableforsale debt security is below its amortized cost the company assesses whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the company will be required to sell the security before recovery if either of those two conditions were met the company would recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value if the company does not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss which is recognized in earnings and the amount related to all other factors which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 

 

premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related availableforsale security as an adjustment to yield using the effectiveinterest method dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 

 

f longterm receivables longterm receivables relate to notes receivable from the sale of computer systems primarily to auto truck motorcycle marine recreational vehicle and heavy equipment dealers unearned income from finance receivables represents the excess of gross receivables over the sales price of the computer systems financed unearned income is amortized using the effectiveinterest method to maintain a constant rate of return over the term of each contract 

 

the allowance for doubtful accounts on longterm receivables is the company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses related to the company’s existing note receivables 

 

g property plant and equipment property plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straightline method leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements the estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows 

 

 

h goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level the company performs this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount if an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount the company would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment if any the company determines the estimated fair value of its reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach which combines the income approach which is the present value of expected cash flows discounted at a riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital and the market approach which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business 

 

i impairment of longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

 

j foreign currency translation the net assets of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars based on exchange rates in effect for each period and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in the periods gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets currency transaction gains or losses which are included in the results of operations are immaterial for all periods presented 

 

k derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and are recognized as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value of the derivatives recognized in either net earnings from continuing operations or accumulated other comprehensive income depending on the timing and designated purpose of the derivative 

 

there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30 2011 or june 30 2010 

 

 

 

l earnings per share “eps” the calculations of basic and diluted eps are as follows 

 

 

options to purchase 09 million 140 million and 329 million shares of common stock for the year ended june 30 2011 “fiscal 2011” the year ended june 30 2010 “fiscal 2010” and the year ended june 30 2009 “fiscal 2009” respectively were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices exceeded the average market price of outstanding common shares for the respective fiscal year 

 

m stockbased compensation the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant the company determines the fair value of stock options issued using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of the company’s stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of a stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

 

n internal use software expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three to fiveyear period on a straightline basis for software developed or obtained for internal use the company capitalizes costs the company’s policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software in addition the company also capitalizes certain payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects the amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects costs associated with preliminary project stage activities training maintenance and all other postimplementation stage activities are expensed as incurred the company also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities 

 

o computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed the company capitalizes certain costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed the company’s policy provides for the capitalization of all software production costs upon reaching technological feasibility for a specific product technological feasibility is attained when software products have a completed working model whose consistency with the overall product design has been confirmed by testing costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred the establishment of technological feasibility requires judgment by management and in many instances is only attained a short time prior to the general release of the software upon the general release of the software product to customers capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized over a threeyear period on a straightline basis maintenancerelated costs are expensed as incurred

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 100 million in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known

the company is subject to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable the company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss at this time the company is unable to estimate any possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to the matters described above this is primarily because these matters are still in early stages and involve complex issues subject to inherent uncertainty there can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in a manner that is not adverse to the company 

 

it is not the company’s business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position results of operations and cash flows the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes in the normal course of business the company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the company’s services and products the company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties

 item 1a risk factors 

 

  our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires reference in this section to “we” “ours” “us” or similar terms means adp together with its subsidiaries the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business 

 

changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings 

 

  portions of adp’s business are subject to governmental regulations changes in governmental regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees in addition changes in taxation requirements in the united states or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income 

 

 

security and privacy breaches may hurt our business 

 

  we store electronically personal information about our clients and employees of our clients in addition our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans there is no guarantee that the systems and procedures that we maintain to protect against unauthorized access to such information are adequate to protect against all security breaches any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and the growth of our business could be adversely affected 

 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation 

 

  many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation we have disaster recovery plans in place to protect our businesses against natural disasters security breaches military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations our disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

 

  our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

  trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us in addition the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our access to shortterm debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our employer services business 

 

  we invest our client funds in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities money market securities and other cash equivalents nevertheless our client fund assets are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks which individually or in unison may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility 

 

  we are dependent upon various large banks to execute automated clearing house and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

 

  we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income from affiliates operating in nonus dollar currency environments and as a result we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

 

  the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest longterm debt and commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

 

  our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel results from our operations may suffer

executive overview 

 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 “fiscal 2010” we maintained focus on the execution of our fivepoint strategic growth program which consists of 

strengthening the core business   growing our differentiated hr business process outsourcing “bpo” offerings   focusing on international expansion   entering adjacent markets that leverage the core and   expanding pretax margins adp’s fiscal 2010 was a challenging year and our results continued to be impacted by the economic downturn including high unemployment levels recordlow interest rates and volatile financial markets however as we look back over fiscal 2010 we were pleased that adp’s financial results were better than we initially anticipated the economy showed signs of stabilization early on in the fiscal year demand for adp’s solutions increased and key business metrics including employer services’ sales retention and pays per control began to improve during the second half of the year 

 

consolidated revenues grew 1 to 89277 million in fiscal 2010 from 88384 million in fiscal 2009 aided by fluctuations in foreign currency rates which increased revenues 682 million in fiscal 2010 pretax earnings from continuing operations declined 2 to 18632 million net earnings from continuing operations declined 9 to 12073 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 8 to 240 from 262 in fiscal 2009 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 included favorable tax items that reduced the provision for income taxes by 122 million and 1200 million respectively excluding the favorable tax items from both years net earnings from continuing operations declined 1 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined slightly from 238 to 237 

 

employer services’ revenues were flat in fiscal 2010 in the united states revenues from our traditional payroll and payroll tax filing business declined 4 for the full year and beyond payroll revenues grew 6 for the full year “pays per control” which represents the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls as measured on a samestoresales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 130000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of us geographic regions decreased 34 in fiscal 2010 but were slightly positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 worldwide client retention increased 04 percentage points as compared to the prior year peo services’ revenues grew 11 in fiscal 2010 due to a 5 increase in the average number of worksite employees as well as an increase in benefits costs and state unemployment insurance rates employer services’ and peo services’ worldwide new business sales which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients increased 4 to just over 1 billion in fiscal 2010 dealer services’ revenues decreased 3 in fiscal 2010 due to continued dealership consolidations and closings lower transactional revenue and dealerships reducing services in order to cut their discretionary expenses consolidated interest on funds held for clients declined 11 or 670 million to 5428 million the decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 36 in fiscal 2010 as compared to 40 in fiscal 2009 average client funds balances increased slightly as a result of wage growth and an increase in state unemployment insurance withholdings offset by the decline in pays per control 

 

we have a strong business model which has approximately 90 recurring revenues excellent margins from the ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows strong client retention and low capital expenditure requirements additionally adp has continued to return excess cash to our shareholders in the last five fiscal years we have reduced the company’s common stock outstanding by approximately 15 through share buybacks partially offset by common stock issued under employee stockbased compensation programs we have also raised the dividend payout per share for 35 consecutive years 

 

 

we are especially pleased with the performance of our investment portfolio and the investment choices we made our investment portfolio does not contain any assetbacked securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages alternativea mortgages subprime auto loans or home equity loans collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations credit default swaps assetbacked commercial paper derivatives auction rate securities structured investment vehicles or noninvestmentgrade fixedincome securities we own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card rate reduction and auto loan assetbacked securities secured predominately by prime collateral all collateral on assetbacked securities is performing as expected in addition we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” we do not own subordinated debt preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies we do own aaa rated mortgagebacked securities which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages these securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15year and 30year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations in addition our aaa credit rating has helped us maintain uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market 

 

our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30 2010 with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of 17755 million our net cash flows provided by operating activities were 16821 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to 15626 million in fiscal 2009 this increase in cash flows from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was due to tax refunds received and a reduction in cash bonuses paid partially offset by an increase in pension plan contributions as compared to the prior year

our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a shortterm commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to 60 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper in august 2010 the company increased the us shortterm commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to 625 billion in aggregate maturity value our commercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days at june 30 2010 there was no commercial paper outstanding at june 30 2009 we had 7300 million in commercial paper outstanding such amount was repaid on july 1 2009 in fiscal 2010 and 2009 our average borrowings were 16 billion and 19 billion respectively at a weighted average interest rate of 02 and 10 respectively the weighted average maturity of our commercial paper was less than two days in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 throughout fiscal 2010 we had full access to our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations 

 

 

our us and canadian shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements these agreements are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days we have 2 billion available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements at june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively there were no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements in fiscal 2010 and 2009 we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of 4250 million and 4259 million respectively at a weighted average interest rate of 02 and 13 respectively we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations 

 

in june 2010 we entered into a 25 billion 364day credit agreement with a group of lenders the 364day facility replaced our prior 225 billion 364day facility in addition we entered into a threeyear 15 billion credit facility maturing in june 2013 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by 5000 million subject to the availability of additional commitments the threeyear facility replaced our prior 15 billion fiveyear facility which expired in june 2010 we also have an existing 225 billion fiveyear credit facility that matures in june 2011 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by 5000 million subject to the availability of additional commitments the interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to libor the federal funds effective rate or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by us to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing we are also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes if necessary we had no borrowings through june 30 2010 under the credit agreements we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the 625 billion available to us under the credit agreements 

 

our investment portfolio does not contain any assetbacked securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages alternativea mortgages subprime auto loans or home equity loans collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations credit default swaps assetbacked commercial paper derivatives auction rate securities structured investment vehicles or noninvestmentgrade fixedincome securities we own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card rate reduction auto loan and other assetbacked securities secured predominately by prime collateral all collateral on assetbacked securities is performing as expected in addition we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” we do not own subordinated debt preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies we do own aaa rated mortgagebacked securities which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages these securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15year and 30year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations 

 

capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2010 were 902 million as compared to 1676 million in fiscal 2009 and 1863 million in fiscal 2008 the capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 related to our data center and other facility improvements to support our operations we expect capital expenditures in the year ending june 30 2011 “fiscal 2011” to be between 150 million and 170 million 

 

 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of june 30 2010 

 

 

 

 

in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services as of june 30 2010 the obligations relating to these matters which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2011 total 181367 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets we had 188326 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2010 

 

the company’s wholly owned subsidiary adp indemnity inc provides workers’ compensation and employer liability insurance coverage for our peo worksite employees we have secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from thirdparty carriers that cap losses that reach a certain level in each policy year we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo business in fiscal 2010 and 2009 the net premium was 678 million and 608 million respectively in fiscal 2010 and 2009 we paid claims of 538 million and 436 million respectively at june 30 2010 our cash and marketable securities included balances totaling approximately 2086 million to cover the actuarially estimated cost of workers’ compensation claims for the policy years that the peo worksite employees were covered by adp indemnity inc 

 

in the normal course of business we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties 

 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

 

our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

 

our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals consistent with those goals we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents at june 30 2010 approximately 79 of the availableforsale securities categorized as us treasury and direct obligations of us government agencies were invested in senior unsecured noncallable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks fannie mae and freddie mac 

 

we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client fund obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client fund assets to satisfy all of our client funds obligations 

 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client fund assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 6 billion commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 by moody’s the highest possible credit rating our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our 6 billion committed revolving credit facilities however the availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our ability to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

 

we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate bonds is bbb and for assetbacked and commercial mortgagebacked securities is aaa the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years commercial paper must be rated a1p1 and for time deposits banks must have a financial strength rating of c or better 

 

 

details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

 

 

our laddering strategy exposes us to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased by 50 basis points from 39 for fiscal 2009 to 34 for fiscal 2010 a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 9 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2011 a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2011 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service at june 30 2010 approximately 85 of our availableforsale securities held an aaa or aa rating in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 

 

during fiscal 2010 we were exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on us dollar denominated shortterm intercompany amounts payable by a canadian subsidiary to a us subsidiary of the company in the amount of 1786 million us dollars in order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar the canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract which obligated the canadian subsidiary to buy 1786 million us dollars at a rate of 115 canadian dollars to each us dollar on december 1 2009 upon settlement of such contract on december 1 2009 an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the canadian subsidiary to buy 294 million us dollars at a rate of 106 canadian dollars to each us dollar on february 26 2010 the net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of 158 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency marktomarket gains on the related shortterm intercompany amounts payable the shortterm intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the canadian subsidiary to the us subsidiary by february 2010 

 

 

there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30 2010 2009 or 2008 

 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 200913 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 200913 modifies the guidance related to accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables by providing an alternative when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or thirdparty evidence tpe does not exist to determine the selling price of a deliverable the alternative when vsoe or tpe does not exist is the best estimate of the selling price of the deliverable consideration for multiple deliverables is then allocated based upon the relative selling price of the deliverables and revenue is recognized as earned for each deliverable asu 200913 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 unless the election is made to adopt asu 200913 retrospectively in either case early adoption is permitted the adoption of asu 200913 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200914 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 200914 asu 200914 modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude a nonsoftware components of tangible products and b software components of tangible products that are sold licensed or leased with tangible products when the software components and nonsoftware components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products functionality asu 200914 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 unless the election is made to adopt asu 200914 retrospectively in either case early adoption is permitted the adoption of asu 200914 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition  our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services’ payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services’ clientrelated funds we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

 

we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses eg dealer services’ dealer management systems for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

 

we assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 

 

 

goodwill  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with asc 35010 which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount if an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment if any we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach which utilizes a discounted cash flow model in addition we use comparative market multiples to corroborate our discounted cash flow results we had 23833 million of goodwill as of june 30 2010 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings 

 

income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

 

there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically an entity’s tax benefits must be “more likely than not” of being sustained assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2010 and 2009 the company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 1072 million and 928 million respectively 

 

if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 100 million in the next twelve months we do not expect any cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

 

stockbased compensation we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

  it is the responsibility of automatic data processing inc’s “adp” management to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to adp’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

 

  adp’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of adp ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of adp are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of adp and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of adp’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of adp 

 

 

  because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

 

  management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of adp’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2010 based upon criteria set forth in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment management determined that adp’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2010

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

to the board of directors and stockholders of automatic data processing inc roseland new jersey 

 

  we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of automatic data processing inc and subsidiaries the company as of june 30 2010 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

 

  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

  a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

markets and marketing methods 

  employer services offers services in the united states canada europe south america primarily brazil australia and asia peo services are offered exclusively in the united states dealer services has offerings in north america europe africa and the asia pacific region in select emerging markets dealer services uses distributors to sell implement and support adp’s solutions 

  none of adp’s major business groups have a single homogenous client base or market employer services and peo services have clients from a large variety of industries and markets within this client base are concentrations of clients in specific industries dealer services primarily serves automobile dealers which in turn may be dependent on a relatively small number of automobile manufacturers but also serves heavy truck powersports  ie  motorcycle marine and recreational and heavy machinery dealers auto repair shops used car lots state departments of motor vehicles and manufacturers of automobiles and trucks employer services also sells to automobile dealers while concentrations of clients exist no one client or industry group is material to adp’s overall revenues 

  historically adp’s businesses have not been overly sensitive to price changes although in the current economic conditions we have observed among some clients and groups of clients an impact on sensitivity to pricing and demand for adp’s services in fiscal 2009 employer services continued to grow primarily due to new business started in the period and the impact of price increases partially offset by a decrease in average client funds balances and a decrease in the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls dealer services was negatively impacted by the difficulties facing the automotive industry due to dealership consolidations and closings lower transactional revenue and dealerships reducing services in order to cut their discretionary expenses and peo services grew primarily due to an increase in the average number of worksite employees and a related increase in administrative revenues 

  adp enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or business unit in adp is subject to unique market risk 

competition 

  the industries in which adp operates are highly competitive adp knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of business outsourcing solutions in the world employer services and peo services compete with other independent business outsourcing companies companies providing enterprise resource planning services software companies and financial institutions captive inhouse functions whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems are another competitive factor in the industries in which employer services and peo services operate dealer services’ competitors include full service dms providers such as the reynolds  reynolds company dealer services’ largest dms competitor in the united states and canada and companies providing applications and services that compete with dealer services’ nondms applications and services 

  competition in adp’s industries is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and price adp believes that it is very competitive in each of these areas and that there are no material negative factors impacting adp’s competitive position 

clients and client contracts 

  adp provides its services to about 570000 clients in fiscal 2009 no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2 of annual consolidated revenues 

  our business is typically characterized by longterm client relationships that result in recurring revenue adp is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time as little as 24 hours for an sbs client to a longer period generally six to twelve months for a national account services or dealer services client with multiple deliverables and in some cases may exceed two years for a large globalview client or other large complicated implementation although we monitor sales that have not yet been billed or installed we do not view this metric as material in light of the recurring nature of our business this is not a reported number but it is used by management as a planning tool relating to resources needed to install services and a means of assessing our performance against the installation timing expectations of our clients 

  adp’s average client retention is estimated at just under 10 years in employer services approximately 5 years in peo services and 10 or more years in dealer services and has not varied significantly from period to period 

  adp’s services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions no one price quotation or service agreement is material to adp

 item 1a risk factors 

  our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires reference in this section to “we” “ours” “us” or similar terms means adp together with its subsidiaries the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time 

changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings 

  portions of adp’s business are subject to governmental regulations changes in governmental regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing funds that we collect from clients but have not yet remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees thus reducing our revenues and income from this source in addition changes in taxation requirements in the united states or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income 

security and privacy breaches may hurt our business 

  we store electronically personal information about our clients and employees of our clients in addition our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans there is no guarantee that the systems and procedures that we maintain to protect against unauthorized access to such information are adequate to protect against all security breaches any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and the growth of our business could be materially adversely affected 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation 

  many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation we have disaster recovery plans in place to protect our businesses against natural disasters security breaches military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations in the event of a catastrophic occurrence our disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

  our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing solutions and services if we fail to respond successfully to the technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

  trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our flexibility to access shortterm debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our employer services business in addition certain types of investments may not be available to us or become too risky for us to invest in which may reduce the interest we earn on client funds if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity we are dependent upon various large banks to execute automated clearing house and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

  the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest longterm debt and commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

  our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel expected results from our operations may suffer

executive overview 

  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 “fiscal 2009” we maintained focus on the execution of our fivepoint strategic growth program which consists of 

strengthening the core business   growing our differentiated hr business process outsourcing “bpo” offerings   focusing on international expansion   entering adjacent markets that leverage the core and   expanding pretax margins   adp’s fiscal 2009 results were clearly impacted by the severe economic conditions including rising unemployment declining automobile sales low interest rates and volatile financial markets however we are meeting the challenge of this recessionary environment by continuing to focus on our fivepoint strategy and taking the actions necessary for the company to be stronger and even better positioned for when the economy improves 

  the headwinds from the global recession impacted our growth during fiscal 2009 consolidated revenues from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 grew 1 to 88671 million as compared to 87765 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 “fiscal 2008” due to increases in revenues in employer services of 4 or 2253 million to 65877 million and peo services of 12 or 1253 million to 11858 million such increases were partially offset by fluctuations in foreign currency rates which reduced our revenue by 1880 million or 2 a decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients of 747 million and a decrease in dealer services revenue of 3 or 428 million earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and net earnings from continuing operations increased 5 and 14 respectively diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20 to 263 in fiscal 2009 from 220 per share in fiscal 2008 on fewer weighted average diluted shares outstanding 

  employer services’ revenues increased 4 and peo services revenues increased 12 in fiscal 2009 employer services’ and peo services’ new business sales which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients declined 15 worldwide to approximately 9823 million in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2009 average client funds balances declined 3 due to lower bonuses lower wage growth and a decline in pays per control our key business metrics for employer services showed yearoveryear declines in fiscal 2009 “pays per control” which represents the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls as measured on a samestoresales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 137000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of us geographic regions decreased 25 in fiscal 2009 client retention decreased 12 percentage points worldwide over last year’s record level peo services’ revenues grew 12 in fiscal 2009 due to a 10 increase in the average number of worksite employees dealer services’ revenues which were negatively impacted by the difficulties facing the automotive industry decreased 3 in fiscal 2009 due to dealership consolidations and closings lower transactional revenue and dealerships reducing services in order to cut their discretionary expenses 

  we have a strong focus on strengthening our business model which has approximately 90 recurring revenues excellent margins from the ability to generate consistent strong cash flows strong client retention and low capital expenditure requirements we believe we have rightsized the organization for the expected nearterm lower revenue growth additionally adp has continued to return excess cash to our shareholders we have bought back approximately 20 of the company’s common stock that was outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 we have also raised the dividend payout for 34 consecutive years while still maintaining our aaa credit rating 

  we are especially pleased with the performance of our investment portfolio and the investment choices we made throughout the year our investment portfolio does not contain any assetbacked securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages alternativea mortgages subprime auto loans or home equity loans collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations credit default swaps assetbacked commercial paper derivatives auction rate securities structured investment vehicles or noninvestmentgrade fixedincome securities we own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card rate reduction auto loan and other assetbacked securities secured predominately by prime collateral all collateral on assetbacked securities is performing as expected in addition we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” we do not own subordinated debt preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies we do own aaa rated mortgagebacked securities which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages these securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15year and 30year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio this investment strategy is supported by our shortterm financing arrangements necessary to satisfy shortterm funding requirements relating to client funds obligations in addition our aaa credit rating has helped us maintain uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market 

  our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30 2009 with cash and marketable securities of 23885 million the cash and marketable securities balance included 7300 million of cash related to the outstanding commercial paper borrowing as of june 30 2009 which was repaid on july 1 2009 this borrowing was a normal part of our client funds extended investment strategy our net cash flows provided by operating activities were 15626 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to 17722 million in fiscal 2008 this decrease in cash flows from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable and the timing of funding of our employee benefits program partially offset by a decrease in pension plan contributions as compared to the prior year 

results of operations analysis of consolidated operations 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

 15 

total revenues 

  our consolidated revenues grew 1 to 88671 million in fiscal 2009 from 87765 in fiscal 2008 due to increases in revenues in employer services of 4 or 2253 million to 65877 million and peo services of 12 or 1253 million to 11858 million such increases were partially offset by fluctuations in foreign currency rates which reduced our revenue by 1880 million or 2 a decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients of 747 million and a decrease in dealer services of 3 or 428 million the decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 40 in fiscal 2009 as compared to 44 in fiscal 2008 and a decrease in our average client funds balances for fiscal 2009 of 31 to 152 billion 

total expenses

  our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a shortterm commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to 60 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper our commercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days at june 30 2009 we had 7300 million in commercial paper outstanding such amount was repaid on july 1 2009 at june 30 2008 there was no commercial paper outstanding in fiscal 2009 and 2008 our average borrowings were 19 billion and 14 billion respectively at a weighted average interest rate of 10 and 42 respectively the weighted average maturity of our commercial paper was less than two days in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 throughout fiscal 2009 we had full access to our us shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations 

  our us and canadian shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days at june 30 2009 there were no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements at june 30 2008 we had an 118 million obligation outstanding related to reverse repurchase agreements that matured on july 2 2008 and was repaid in fiscal 2009 and 2008 we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of 4259 million and 3604 million respectively at a weighted average interest rate of 13 and 34 respectively we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations 

  in june 2009 we entered into a 225 billion 364day credit agreement with a group of lenders the 364day facility replaced our prior 225 billion 364day facility in addition we also have a 15 billion credit facility and a 225 billion credit facility that mature in june 2010 and june 2011 respectively the credit facilities maturing in june 2010 and june 2011 are fiveyear facilities that contain accordion features under which the aggregate commitments can each be increased by 5000 million subject to the availability of additional commitments the interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to libor the federal funds effective rate or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by us to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing we are also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes if necessary we had no borrowings through june 30 2009 under the credit agreements we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the 60 billion available to us under the credit agreements

  we have an investment in a money market fund called the reserve fund during the quarter ended september 30 2008 the net asset value of the reserve fund decreased below 1 per share as a result of the full writeoff of the reserve fund’s holdings in debt securities issued by lehman brothers holdings inc which filed for bankruptcy protection on september 15 2008 the reserve fund has suspended redemptions and is in the process of being liquidated at september 30 2008 we reclassified 2111 million of our investment from cash and cash equivalents to shortterm marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet due to the fact that these assets no longer met the definition of a cash equivalent additionally we have reflected the impact of such reclassification on the statements of consolidated cash flows for fiscal 2009 as a reclassification from cash equivalents to shortterm marketable securities during fiscal 2009 we recorded an 183 million loss to other income net on the statement of consolidated earnings to recognize our prorata share of the estimated losses of the reserve fund as of june 30 2009 we had received approximately 1985 million in distributions from the reserve fund subsequent to the distributions received from the reserve fund and the charges recorded during fiscal 2009 we have a remaining balance of 39 million in shortterm marketable securities related to the reserve fund as of june 30 2009 

  during fiscal 2009 the number of automotive dealerships in the united states to which we provide services has continued to decline primarily due to the consolidation of dealerships and dealerships going out of business in april 2009 chrysler llc “chrysler” filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code to reorganize its business and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy in june 2009 in june 2009 general motors corporation “gm” filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code to reorganize its business and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy in july 2009 we expect the total number of gm and chrysler dealerships in the united states to decline by about 1800 over the next 12 to 18 months given our share of the market the impact of these dealership closings to our revenues in dealer services is expected to be up to 50 million on an annualized basis at june 30 2009 our notes receivable and accounts receivable balances on the consolidated balance sheets include gross receivables of 73 million and 35 million respectively due from automobile dealerships that sell gm or chrysler products in the united states at june 30 2009 we do not have any significant amounts due to us directly from gm or chrysler 

  capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2009 were 1677 million as compared to 1864 million in fiscal 2008 and 1697 million in fiscal 2007 the capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 related to our data center and other facility improvements to support our operations we expect capital expenditures in the year ended june 30 2010 “fiscal 2010” to be between 130 million and 150 million 

  the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of june 30 2009

  in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services as of june 30 2009 the obligations relating to these matters which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2010 total 159926 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets we had 164192 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2009 

  the company’s whollyowned subsidiary adp indemnity inc provides workers’ compensation and employer liability insurance coverage for our peo worksite employees we have secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from thirdparty carriers that cap losses that reach a certain level in each policy year we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo business in fiscal 2009 and 2008 the net premium was 608 million and 514 million respectively in fiscal 2009 and 2008 we paid claims of 436 million and 381 million respectively at june 30 2009 our cash and marketable securities included balances totaling approximately 1816 million to cover the actuariallyestimated cost of workers’ compensation claims for the policy years that the peo worksite employees were covered by adp indemnity inc

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

  our corporate investments are invested in cash equivalents and highly liquid investmentgrade securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm fixedincome securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

  our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals consistent with those goals we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents at june 30 2009 approximately 85 of the availableforsale securities categorized as us treasury and direct obligations of us government agencies were invested in senior unsecured noncallable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks fannie mae and freddie mac 

  we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio as part of our client funds investment strategy we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client fund obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have already been invested in availableforsale securities we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding in virtually all instances the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation as a result of this practice we have consistently maintained the required level of client fund assets to satisfy all of our client funds obligations 

  there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client fund assets such risks include liquidity risk including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate if necessary our availableforsale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations however our investments are made with the safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity including our corporate cash balances available borrowings under our 6 billion commercial paper program rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 by moody’s the highest possible credit rating our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our 6 billion committed revolving credit facilities however the availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings may limit our flexibility to access shortterm debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business in addition to liquidity risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk as discussed below 

  we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate bonds is bbb and for assetbacked and commercial mortgagebacked securities is aaa the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years for single a rated securities is 7 years and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years commercial paper must be rated a1p1 and for time deposits banks must have a financial strength rating of c or better 

  details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

   our laddering strategy exposes us to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes the annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased by 50 basis points from 44 for fiscal 2008 to 39 for fiscal 2009 a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates eg overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 6 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2010 a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 3 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelvemonth period ending june 30 2010 

  we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities we limit credit risk by investing in investmentgrade securities primarily aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service at june 30 2009 approximately 83 of our availableforsale securities held an aaa or aa rating in addition we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30 2009 or 2008

critical accounting policies 

  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

  revenue recognition  our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services’ payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services’ clientrelated funds we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

  we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses eg dealer services’ dealer management systems for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

  we assess collectibility of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectibility determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 

  goodwill  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount if an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment if any we use discounted cash flows to determine fair values we had 23755 million of goodwill as of june 30 2009 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings 

  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

  the company accounts for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in accordance with the provisions of fin 48 which was adopted by the company on july 1 2007 fin 48 prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically it clarifies that an entity’s tax benefits must be “more likely than not” of being sustained assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2009 and 2008 the company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which include interest and penalties were 928 million and 4042 million respectively 

  if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions based on current estimates settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to 205 million in the next twelve months we do not expect any cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

  stockbased compensation sfas no 123r requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binominal optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

 item 1a risk factors 

  our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this form 10k unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires reference in this section to “we” “ours” “us” or similar terms means adp together with its subsidiaries the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time 

changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings 

  portions of adp’s business are subject to governmental regulations changes in governmental regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some of the aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing funds that we collect from clients but have not yet remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees thus reducing our revenues and income from this source 

security and privacy breaches may hurt our business 

  we store electronically personal information about our clients and employees of our clients in addition our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans there is no guarantee that the systems and procedures that we maintain to protect against unauthorized access to such information are adequate to protect against all security breaches any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and the growth of our business could be materially adversely affected 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation 

  many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation we have disaster recovery plans in place to protect our businesses against natural disasters security breaches military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations in the event of a catastrophic occurrence our disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet customer needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

  our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing customer needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to customer demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing products and services if we fail to respond successfully to the technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

  trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

  the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest longterm debt and commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

  our ability to grow and provide our customers with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our customers competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel expected results from our operations may suffer

  our product set and global breadth depth and reach in the marketplace have never been stronger during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 the company took efforts to divest certain nonstrategic slowgrowing businesses this allowed us to set our focus on our businesses that have strong underlying growth attributes and that operate in large underpenetrated markets we completed the taxfree spinoff of our former brokerage services group business on march 30 2007 into an independent publicly traded company called broadridge financial solutions inc we made the decision to spinoff this business for several reasons first we determined that the growth potential of the brokerage services group business while part of adp was expected to be lower than that of our other businesses further the brokerage services group business had operating models and longterm growth plans that were different than those of our other businesses the spinoff allowed more concentrated focus by each management team on its own respective core business which is expected to be more beneficial to each company’s stockholders clients and associates 

  in addition during fiscal 2007 we divested sandy corporation which was previously reported in our dealer services segment during fiscal 2008 we finalized the sale of our travel clearing business which was previously reported in our other segment we divested sandy corporation and travel clearing because they were nonstrategic businesses that did not complement our other businesses moreover the growth potential of these businesses was also believed to be slower than that of our other businesses 

  these transactions along with our cash flows from operating activities have allowed us to continue to focus on the objective of returning excess cash to our stockholders through our share buyback program and our cash dividends to stockholders subsequent to the completion of these transactions the new adp is a more focused company which we believe has excellent growth potential for revenue and pretax earnings 

  our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid with cash and marketable securities of 16603 million at june 30 2008 our net cash flows provided by operating activities were 17722 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to 12980 million in fiscal 2007 this increase exceeded our expectations due to the timing of certain collections of accounts receivable and the timing of payments of certain accruals

  net cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal 2008 totaled 26139 million as compared to 2769 million used in fiscal 2007 this increase to funds provided was due to a net decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents and other restricted assets held to satisfy client funds obligations of 47176 million a decrease in cash paid for intangibles of 534 million and a decrease in net cash paid for acquisitions of 3496 million additionally proceeds received from the sale of businesses increased by 952 million these increases in cash provided were partially offset by the change in net purchasesproceeds from our marketable securities of 16575 million the 386 million of proceeds from the sale of a minority investment during fiscal 2007 and the 6601 million of net dividends received from broadridge during fiscal 2007

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

  in order to provide more costeffective liquidity and maximize our interest income we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in these instances a portion of this portfolio is considered and reported within the corporate investment balances in order to reflect the pure client funds assets and related obligations interest income on the corporate investment portion of the portfolio is reported in other income net on our statements of consolidated earnings 

  our corporate investments are invested in cash equivalents and highly liquid investment grade securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm marketable securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

  our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals consistent with those goals we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investmentgrade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents at june 30 2008 approximately 87 of the availableforsale securities categorized as us treasury and direct obligations of us government agencies was invested in senior debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks fannie mae and freddie mac

  details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

   in fiscal 2008 approximately 25 of our overall investment portfolio was invested in cash and cash equivalents and therefore was impacted by changes in shortterm interest rates the other 75 of our investment portfolio was invested in fixedincome securities with varying maturities of 10 years or less which were also subject to interest rate risk including reinvestment risk 

  factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies and is impacted by daily interest rate changes a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates  eg  overnight interest rates or the fed funds rates and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2009 average investment balances and any related borrowings would result in approximately a 7 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelvemonth period a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2009 average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 3 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelvemonth period 

  the company is exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities the company limits credit risk by investing in aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service at june 30 2008 approximately 90 of our availableforsale securities held aaa or aa ratings in addition we also limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position results of operations and cash flows the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes

critical accounting policies 

  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

  revenue recognition  our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services’ payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services’ clientrelated funds we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

  we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses eg dealer services’ dealer management systems for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

  we assess collectibility of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectibility determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 

  goodwill  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount if an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment if any we use discounted cash flows to determine fair values when available and as appropriate comparative market multiples are used to corroborate discounted cash flow results we had 24267 million of goodwill as of june 30 2008 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings 

  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

  we adopted the provisions of fin 48 on july 1 2007 fin 48 prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return specifically it clarifies that an entity’s tax benefits must be “more likely than not” of being sustained assuming that position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements if the position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

  stockbased compensation sfas no 123r requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binominal optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of our stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions is subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options

markets and marketing methods 

  employer services offers services in the united states canada europe south america primarily brazil australia and asia dealer services has offerings in the united states canada south africa asia and europe peo services are offered in the united states 

  none of adp’s major business groups have a single homogenous client base or market for example dealer services primarily serves automotive dealers but also serves heavy truck powersports  ie  motorcycle marine and recreational and agricultural equipment dealers auto repair shops used car lots state departments of motor vehicles and manufacturers of automobiles trucks and agricultural equipment employer services and peo services have clients from a large variety of industries and markets within this client base are concentrations of clients in specific industries employer services also sells to auto dealers while concentrations of clients exist no one client or industry group is material to adp’s overall revenues 

  adp’s businesses are not overly sensitive to price changes although economic conditions among selected clients and groups of clients may and do have a temporary impact on demand for adp’s services in fiscal 2007 employer services continued to grow primarily due to the increase in its united states payroll and payroll tax businesses including new business started in the fiscal year an increase in the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls price increases an increase in client funds balances and improved client retention dealer services grew due to both internal revenue growth and growth from acquisitions primarily the acquisition of kerridge computer company ltd in december 2005 and bz results llc and peo services grew primarily due to an increase in the number of worksite employees and higher administrative revenues as a result of an increase in the average number of worksite employees 

  adp enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or business unit in adp is subject to unique market risk 

competition

  competition in adp’s industries is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and price adp believes that it is very competitive in each of these areas and that there are no material negative factors impacting adp’s competitive position 

clients and client contracts 

  adp provides its services to approximately 585000 clients in fiscal 2007 no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2 of annual consolidated revenues 

  our business is typically characterized by longterm customer relationships that result in recurring revenue adp is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for our clients depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time up to two weeks for an sbs client to a longer period generally six to twelve months for a national account services or dealer services client with multiple deliverables and in some cases may exceed two years for a large globalview client or other large complicated implementation although we monitor sales that have not yet been billed or installed we do not view this metric as material in light of the recurring nature of our business this is not a reported number but it is used by management as a planning tool relating to resources needed to install services and a means of assessing our performance against the installation timing expectations of our clients 

  adp’s average client retention is estimated at more than 10 years in employer services more than 5 years in peo services and 10 or more years in dealer services and has not varied significantly from period to period 

  adp’s services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions no one price quotation or service agreement is material to adp discounts rebates and promotions offered by adp to clients are not material

product development 

  adp continually upgrades enhances and expands its existing products and services generally no new product or service has a significant effect on adp’s revenues or negatively impacts its existing products and services and adp’s products and services have significant remaining life cycles 

licenses 

  adp is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases adp’s business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses thirdparty licenses patents trademarks and franchises are not material to adp’s business as a whole 

number of employees 

  adp employed approximately 46000 persons as of june 30 2007 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business the following information should be read in conjunction with mda quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under mda included in this form 10k unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires reference in this section to “we” “ours” “us” or similar terms means adp together with its subsidiaries the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time 

changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings 

  portions of adp’s business are subject to governmental regulations changes in governmental regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some of the aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing funds that we collect from clients but have not yet remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees thus reducing our revenues and income from this source 

security and privacy breaches may hurt our business 

  we store electronically personal information including social security numbers about our clients and employees of our clients in addition our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans there is no guarantee that the systems and procedures that we maintain to protect against unauthorized access to such information are adequate to protect against all security breaches any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and the growth of our business could be materially adversely affected 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation 

  many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation we have disaster recovery plans in place to protect our businesses against natural disasters security breaches military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations in the event of a catastrophic occurrence our disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet customer needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

  our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing customer needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to customer demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing products and services if we fail to respond successfully to the technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

  trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

  the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest longterm debt and commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

  our ability to grow and provide our customers with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our customers competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel expected results from our operations may suffer

  we credit peo services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 45 therefore peo services’ results are not influenced by changes in interest rates interest on client funds recorded within the peo services segment increased 10 million in fiscal 2007 due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of increased peo services’ new business and growth in our existing client base the average client funds balances were 01 billion in both fiscal 2006 and 2005 

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 

  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 151 million or 38 to 549 million in fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues described above net of the related cost of providing benefits and workers compensation coverage and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees which are included in cost of revenues and contributed to a 371 million increase in our earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 this increase is attributable to 19 growth in the average worksite employees and improvement in margins on the workers compensation and state unemployment components of the peo services’ product offering the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of 371 million was partially offset by an increase in our cost of revenues of 108 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 lastly our expenses associated with new business sales increased 143 million in fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of growth in our salesforce and an increase in sales over fiscal 2006 of 30

revenues 

  dealer services’ revenues increased 1530 million or 14 to 12258 million in fiscal 2007 the increase in revenues in fiscal 2007 was driven by both internal revenue growth and by acquisitions revenues increased for our dealer business systems in north america by 740 million to 9468 million due to growth in our key services the growth in our key services was driven by the increased users for application service provider “asp” managed services increased credit check and computerized vehicle registration “cvr” transaction volume new network installations and increased market penetration of our digital marketing services internal revenue growth which represents revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures was approximately 6 for fiscal 2007

  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 91 million to 1579 million in fiscal 2006 the increases in revenues of our dealer business systems and contributions from recent acquisitions increased earnings in fiscal 2006 these increases were partially offset by additional sales expenses relating to sales personnel headcount additions earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were also negatively impacted by the integration expenses associated with the acquisition of kerridge including 56 million of restructuring expenses 

other 

  the primary components of “other” are miscellaneous processing services and corporate allocations and expenses including stockbased compensation expense reported in net earnings from continuing operations related to the company’s adoption of sfas no 123r effective july 1 2005 of 1305 million 1427 million and 118 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively additionally certain nonrecurring gains and losses including a gain of 386 million on the sale of a minority interest investment in fiscal 2007 are included in “other” 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  our financial condition and balance sheet remain strong at june 30 2007 cash and marketable securities were 18846 million the ratio of longterm debttoequity was 08 at june 30 2007 at june 30 2007 working capital from continuing operations was 15348 million as compared to 15964 million at june 30 2006 this fluctuation is due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities of 540 million and 2571 million respectively these decreases were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 2897 million due to the increased revenues and the timing of collections 

  our principal sources of liquidity are derived from cash generated through operations and through cash and marketable securities on hand we also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our us shortterm commercial paper program and our us and canadian shortterm repurchase agreements in addition we have three unsecured revolving credit agreements that allow us to borrow up to 55 billion in the aggregate our shortterm commercial paper program and repurchase agreements are utilized as the primary instruments to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our revolving credit agreements are in place to provide additional liquidity if needed we have never had borrowings under the revolving credit agreements the company believes that the internally generated cash flows and financing arrangements are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures 

  on march 30 2007 we completed the tax free spinoff of our former brokerage services group business comprised of our former brokerage services and securities clearing and outsourcing services segments into an independent publicly traded company called broadridge financial solutions inc “broadridge” as a result of the spinoff adp stockholders of record on march 23 2007 the “record date” received one share of broadridge common stock with a par value 001 per share for every four shares of adp common stock held by them on the record date and cash for any fractional shares of broadridge common stock we have classified the results of operations of the spunoff business as discontinued operations for all periods presented additionally we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of 11252 million for the noncash reduction in net assets of the brokerage services group business related to the spinoff offset by an increase to retained earnings of 6900 million related to the cash dividend received from broadridge as part of the spinoff 

  in february 2007 we notified holders of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes that we would redeem all the notes that were outstanding as of the end of the business day on march 19 2007 the “redemption date” prior to the redemption date notes with a face value of approximately 39 million were converted into approximately 1 million shares of the company’s common stock we subsequently redeemed the remaining 352 notes outstanding as of the redemption date at a redemption price of 775 for each note representing the accrued value of each note at the time of the redemption 

  net cash flows provided by operating activities were 12980 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to 18125 million in fiscal 2006 as a result of a decrease in the operating activities of discontinued operations of 1861 million as well as an increase of 2472 million in accounts receivable and an increase of 1162 million in other assets the increase in accounts receivable was related to our increased revenues and the timing of collections the increase in other assets was largely due to a 174 million increase in our pension plan cash contributions and a 623 million increase in other current assets due to the timing of certain payments for prepaid insurance and software maintenance contracts in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 

  cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal 2007 totaled 4308 million as compared to 4522 million in fiscal 2006 the fluctuation between periods was due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of businesses included in discontinued operations net of cash divested of 8852 million which was due to the receipt of 8962 million related to the sale of the claims services business and 62 million related to the sale of brokerage services’ financial print business in fiscal 2006 offset by 132 million received in fiscal 2007 representing a purchase price adjustment relating to the fiscal 2006 sale of the claims services business and 40 million received from the sale of sandy corporation in fiscal 2007 this net decrease was offset by the receipt of the 6900 million cash dividend from broadridge which was offset by 299 million of cash retained by broadridge and the proceeds of 386 million received on the sale of a minority investment in fiscal 2007 the cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal 2007 also increased 348 million for cash paid for intangible assets relating to software license fees and increased 1078 million in cash paid for acquisitions as a result of the eleven businesses acquired in fiscal 2007 these increases were offset by a decrease of 860 million in cash paid for capital expenditures due to the completion of the consolidation of the data center facilities in fiscal 2006 

  cash flows used in financing in fiscal 2007 totaled 18844 million as compared to 13488 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in cash used in financing activities was due to increased repurchases of common stock of 6005 million and an increase in dividends paid of 674 million resulting from the increase in the amount of dividends per common share in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 offset by the reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to the repurchase of common stock we purchased 402 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 4774 in fiscal 

2007 as compared to 296 million shares in fiscal 2006 as of june 30 2007 we had remaining board of directors’ authorization to purchase up to 438 million additional shares these increases were offset in part by an increase in proceeds received from the stock purchase plan and exercises of stock options of 1262 million due to higher levels of stock option exercises in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 

  in june 2007 we entered into a 175 billion 364day credit agreement with a group of lenders the 364day facility replaced the company’s prior 175 billion 364day facility we also have a 15 billion credit facility and a 225 billion credit facility that mature in june 2010 and june 2011 respectively the fiveyear facilities contain accordion features under which the aggregate commitments can each be increased by 5000 million subject to the availability of additional commitments the interest rate applicable to the borrowings is tied to libor or prime rate depending on the notification provided by the company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing we are also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and to provide funding for general corporate purposes if necessary there were no borrowings through june 30 2007 under the credit agreements 

  we maintain a us shortterm commercial paper program providing for the issuance of up to 55 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper at the company’s discretion our commercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime1 by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days at june 30 2007 and 2006 there was no commercial paper outstanding in fiscal 2007 and 2006 the company’s average borrowings were 15 billion and 14 billion respectively at a weighted average interest rate of 53 and 41 respectively the weighted average maturity of the company’s commercial paper was less than two days in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

  our us and canadian shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days at june 30 2007 and 2006 there were no outstanding obligations under repurchase agreements in fiscal 2007 and 2006 the company had average outstanding balances under repurchase agreements of 1416 million and 1657 million respectively at a weighted average interest rate of 44 and 35 respectively 

  capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2007 were 1697 million as compared to 2528 million in fiscal 2006 and 1603 million in fiscal 2005 the capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 related to data center and other facility improvements to support our operations the decrease in capital expenditures from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily related to lower capital expenditures relating to the consolidation of the data centers which was completed in fiscal 2006 we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 to be approximately 200 million 

  the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of june 30 2007 

 1 these amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our consolidated balance sheets see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

  in order to provide more costeffective liquidity and maximize our interest income we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in these instances a portion of this portfolio is considered and reported within the corporate investment balances in order to reflect the pure client funds assets and related obligations interest income on the corporate investment portion of the portfolio is reported in other income net on our statements of consolidated earnings 

  our corporate investments are invested in cash equivalents and highly liquid investment grade securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes all of our shortterm and longterm marketable securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

  our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals while also seeking to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investment grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase a significant portion of the client funds assets are invested in us government agency securities 

  we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating for fixed income securities is bbb and for assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities is aaa the maximum maturity at time of purchase for a bbbrated security is 5 years for a single arated securities is 7 years and for aarated and aaarated securities is 10 years commercial paper must be rated a1p1 and for time deposits banks must have a financial strength rating of c or better 

  details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

   in fiscal 2007 approximately 25 of our overall investment portfolio was invested in cash and cash equivalents and therefore is impacted by changes in shortterm interest rates the other 75 of our investment portfolio was invested in fixedincome securities with varying maturities of 10 years or less which were also subject to interest rate risk including reinvestment risk 

  factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies and is impacted by daily interest rate changes a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates  eg  overnight interest rates or the fed funds rates and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2008 average investment balances and any related borrowings would result in approximately an 11 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelvemonth period a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2008 average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 7 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelvemonth period 

  the company is exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities the company limits credit risk by investing in aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service at june 30 2007 approximately 95 of our availableforsale securities held an aaa or aa rating in addition we also limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 

  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position results of operations and cash flows the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes we did not enter into any derivative financial instruments in fiscal 2007 nor were there any derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30 2007 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  in march 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” ratified eitf issue no 0611 “accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on sharebased payment awards” eitf 0611 requires companies to recognize the income tax benefit realized from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and paid to employees for nonvested equityclassified employee sharebased payment awards as an increase to additional paidin capital eitf 0611 is effective for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2007 we do not expect eitf 0611 will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows 

  in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas no 159” sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 this statement provides companies with an option to measure selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 159 will have if any on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

  in september 2006 the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab 108” sab 108 requires registrants to use a combination of two approaches to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors the “rollover” approach which quantifies an error based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement and the “iron curtain” approach which quantifies an error based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year sab 108 permits companies to adjust for the cumulative effect of immaterial errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption we have adopted sab 108 in fiscal 2007 the adoption of sab 108 resulted in an increase to our opening retained earnings as of july 1 2006 of approximately 443 million net of tax 

  in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” this statement would require a company to a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status b measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur reported in comprehensive income the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the related disclosure requirements were adopted by the company at the end of fiscal 2007 

  in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” this statement clarifies the definition of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we believe that the adoption of sfas no 157 will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

  in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 applies to all tax positions accounted for under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “morelikelythannot” to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date if a tax position is not considered “morelikelythannot” to be sustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognized fin 48 requires additional annual disclosures and is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december 15 2006 fin 48 is effective for the company as of the beginning of fiscal 2008  ie  as of july 1 2007 while we continue to analyze the effect of adopting the provisions of fin 48 it is currently expected that a cumulative effect adjustment in the range of 15 million to 30 million will be charged to retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to increase the reserve for uncertain tax positions this estimate is subject to change as we complete our analysis 

critical accounting policies 

  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

  revenue recognition  our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services’ payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services’ clientrelated funds we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

  we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

  we assess collectibility of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectibility determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 

  goodwill  we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the company’s weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process we had 23536 million of goodwill as of june 30 2007 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings 

  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

  stockbased compensation sfas no 123r requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binominal optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of the company’s stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options prior to july 1 2005 we followed apb no 25 and related interpretations under apb no 25 no stockbased compensation expense was recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and with respect to the employee stock purchase plan the discount did not exceed fifteen percent

  adp’s businesses are not overly sensitive to price changes economic conditions among selected clients and groups of clients may and do have a temporary impact on demand for adp’s services in fiscal 2006 employer services continued to grow primarily due to the increase in its united states payroll and payroll tax businesses including new business started in the fiscal year an increase in the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls price increases strong growth in its “beyond payroll” products and improved client retention brokerage services grew primarily due to the increased volume in its investor communication services resulting from an increase in the number of holders of equities and an increase in mutual fund meeting activity dealer services grew primarily due to the acquisition of kerridge computer company ltd in the united kingdom in december 2005 and our investment income on our client funds increased due to the increase in our average client fund balances and higher interest rates

  adp’s competitors include other independent computing services companies companies providing enterprise resource planning services divisions of diversified enterprises and banks another competitive factor in the computing services industry is the inhouse computing function whereby a company installs and operates its own computing systems

clients and client contracts 

  adp provides its services to more than 570000 clients in fiscal 2006 no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2 of annual consolidated revenues 

  our business is typically characterized by longterm customer relationships that result in recurring revenue sales orders from customers are not considered firm until they are installed and begin producing revenue adp receives sales orders in all of our businesses and is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for our clients depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time up to two weeks for an sbs client to a longer period generally six to twelve months for a national account services brokerage or dealer services client with multiple deliverables although we monitor the sales orders from our clients that have not yet been billed or installed we do not view this metric as material in light of the recurring nature of our business this is not a reported number but it is used by management as a planning tool relating to resources needed to install services and a means of assessing our performance against our installation timing expectations and the expectations of our clients 

  adp’s average client retention is estimated at more than 9 years in employer services and is 10 or more years in brokerage services and dealer services and has not varied significantly from period to period

  adp employed approximately 46000 persons as of june 30 2006 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding any statement in this form 10k the following information should be read in conjunction with mda quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k this discussion includes a number of forwardlooking statements you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the first paragraph under mda included in this form 10k unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires reference in this section to “we” “ours” “us” or similar terms means adp together with its subsidiaries the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time 

changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings 

  portions of adp’s business are subject to governmental regulations changes in governmental regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some of the aspects of our business for example a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing funds that we collect from clients but have not yet remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees thus reducing our revenues and income from this source also recently proposed regulatory changes in investor communications requirements could if implemented reduce our revenues and earnings 

security and privacy breaches may hurt our business 

  we store electronically personal information including social security numbers about our clients and employees of our clients in addition our brokerage and trading systems maintain account and trading information for our customers and their clients and our retirement services systems maintain investor account information for retirement plans there is no guarantee that the systems and procedures that we maintain to protect against unauthorized access to such information are adequate to 

protect against all security breaches any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and the growth of our business could be materially adversely affected 

our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation 

  many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis a large number of complicated transactions we rely heavily on our payroll financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation we have disaster recovery plans in place to protect our businesses against natural disasters security breaches military or terrorist actions power or communication failures or similar events despite our preparations in the event of a catastrophic occurrence our disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data service interruptions disruptions to our operations or damage to our important facilities 

if we fail to adapt our technology to meet customer needs and preferences the demand for our services may diminish 

  our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing customer needs and preferences in order to remain competitive and responsive to customer demands we continually upgrade enhance and expand our existing products and services if we fail to respond successfully to the technology challenges the demand for our services may diminish 

political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

  trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels interest rates and trading volumes may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services curtailing their trading operations or renegotiating their contracts with us if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our proposed spinoff of our brokerage services group is subject to inherent risks 

  the proposed spinoff of our brokerage services group discussed in item 9b – “other information” is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties including among others risks that the spinoff will not be consummated increased demands on our management team to accomplish the spinoff significant transaction costs risks of changes in our credit rating as a result of the spinoff see “risk factors – change in our credit ratings could adversly impact our operations and lower our profitability” below and risks from changes in the results of operations of our reportable segments 

change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability 

  the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have consistently given us their highest longterm debt and commercial paper ratings failure to maintain high credit ratings on longterm and shortterm debt could increase our cost of borrowing reduce our ability to obtain intraday borrowing required by our employer services business and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue 

we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 

  our ability to grow and provide our customers with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our customers competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel expected results from our operations may suffer

  with the proceeds received in the united states from the sale of the claims services business and our cash flows from operations we accelerated our share buyback activity and acquired over 29 million of our shares for treasury for approximately 1327 million demonstrating our confidence in the longterm growth prospects of our business

  we are pleased with our strong results in each of our business segments during fiscal 2006 employer services’ revenues grew 10 for fiscal 2006 we credit employer services with interest revenues at a standard rate of 45 therefore employer services’ results are not influenced by changes in interest rates during fiscal 2006 employer services grew average client funds balances 11 as a result of new business and growth in our existing client base the increase in average client funds balances resulted in an increase of interest revenues within employer services which accounted for approximately 1 growth in employer services’ revenues as compared to fiscal 2005 the key metrics in employer services were the strongest they have been in six years the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls “pays per control” increased in all market segments with 24 overall growth in the united states and client retention improved by 02 percentage points worldwide over last year’s record level brokerage services’ revenues grew 10 for the fiscal year revenue growth was primarily from our investor communications business as the volume of pieces delivered increased 8 driven by an increase in mutual fund meetings and other required mutual fund communications as well as 4 stock record growth backoffice average trades per day increased 16 for the fiscal year but the volume increase was offset by a decline in average revenues per trade of 10 securities clearing and outsourcing services’ revenues were 806 million for fiscal 2006 as compared to 615 for the period from its acquisition date of november 1 2004 through june 30 2005 dealer services’ revenues grew 14 for fiscal 2006 primarily due to the effect of acquisitions

results of operations analysis of consolidated operations 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

   the comparison between the results of operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005 is affected by the impact of our adoption of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” effective july 1 2005 using the modified prospective method accordingly prior period amounts have not been restated we believe the inclusion of the “2005 – as adjusted” amounts provides a useful additional perspective to compare the results of operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005 as a result of our adoption of sfas no 123r we use both generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and nongaap measures to manage and evaluate the company’s performance and consider it appropriate to disclose these nongaap measures to assist investors with analyzing business performance and trends however these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the results of operations and diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with gaap 

  the adoption of sfas no 123r requires the recognition of stockbased compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements prior to july 1 2005 we followed accounting principles board opinion 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb no 25” and related interpretations under apb no 25 no stockbased compensation expense was recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and with respect to the employee stock purchase plan the discount did not exceed fifteen percent stockbased compensation expense for our restricted stock program has historically been recognized in our results of operations in accordance with apb no 25 the following table summarizes the stock 

based compensation expense related to our stock option program the employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock program that have been recorded in earnings from continuing operations in each respective period 

   in order to provide a comparable basis between the results of operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005 we have provided pro forma information reflected under the heading “2005 – as adjusted” to provide the fiscal 2005 results as if stockbased compensation expense related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan had been expensed the “2005 – as adjusted” amounts include the following pro forma stockbased compensation expense related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan which are based on the pro forma amounts disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included with this annual report on form 10k

provision for income taxes as reported 

  our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 385 as compared to 373 as reported for fiscal 2005 the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the expensing of stockbased compensation as certain components of our stockbased compensation programs are nondeductible resulting in a higher effective tax rate in addition the effective tax rate increased due to the application of the provisions of the american jobs creation act the “ajca” to our repatriation of approximately 250 million of eligible dividends from nonus subsidiaries which resulted in income tax expense of approximately 10 million during fiscal 2006 these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by a favorable mix in income among tax jurisdictions

  in addition earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased approximately 171 million during fiscal 2005 as a result of the completion of the integration of certain acquisitions primarily probusiness services inc in the prior fiscal year

for two of the largest dealership groups in the united states in addition earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were negatively impacted by the integration costs of acquisitions that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 

other 

  the primary components of “other” are miscellaneous processing services and corporate allocations and expenses including stockbased compensation expense related to the company’s adoption of sfas no 123r effective july 1 2005 of 1684 million 140 million and 123 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  our financial condition and balance sheet remain strong at june 30 2006 cash and marketable securities were 26025 million the ratio of longterm debttoequity was 12 at june 30 2006 at june 30 2006 working capital was 21674 million as compared to 20081 million at june 30 2005 the increase in working capital arose primarily as a result of the increase in cash and cash equivalents associated with the proceeds received from the sale of the claims services business offset by the reduction in the net assets of the claims services business 

  our principal sources of liquidity are derived from cash generated through operations and our cash and marketable securities on hand we also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our us shortterm commercial paper program and our us and canadian shortterm repurchase agreements in addition we have three unsecured revolving credit agreements that allow us to borrow up to 55 billion in the aggregate our shortterm commercial paper program and repurchase agreements are utilized as the primary instruments to meet shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations our revolving credit agreements are in place to provide additional liquidity if needed we have never had borrowings under the revolving credit agreements the company believes that the internally generated cash flows and financing arrangements are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures 

  on april 13 2006 we completed the sale of our claims services business for 975 million in cash which resulted in a gain of 561 million or 453 million after tax and net cash from the transaction of approximately 760 million a portion of the transaction proceeds were received outside of the united states with the sale of the claims services business we accelerated our share buyback activity using a portion of the proceeds received in the united states from the sale of this business to purchase shares 

  on october 22 2004 the ajca was signed into law the ajca created a temporary incentive for the company to repatriate earnings accumulated outside the us by allowing the company to reduce its taxable income by 85 percent of certain eligible dividends received from nonus subsidiaries by the end of the company’s fiscal year ending june 30 2006 in connection with the sale of the claims services business on april 13 2006 and receipt of the related proceeds the company elected to apply the provisions of the ajca to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal 2006 as approved by our board of directors in june 2006 approximately 250 million was repatriated under the ajca income tax expense of approximately 10 million associated with this repatriation was recorded in the fourth quarter 

  on november 1 2004 we acquired the us clearing and brokerdealer business and formed the securities clearing and outsourcing services segment to report the results of the acquired business the securities clearing and outsourcing services segment provides thirdparty clearing operations in 

the regulated brokerdealer industry the cash flows from operations from this business differ from that of our other businesses because the brokerdealer thirdparty clearing activities utilize payables to finance their business activities and the regulations associated with the brokerdealer industry require cash or securities to be segregated for the exclusive benefit of customers in certain circumstances based on regulatory calculations driven by customers’ balances as a result management analyzes cash flows provided from operating activities of the securities clearing and outsourcing services segment separately from all other businesses management’s view of the net cash flows provided by operating activities is as follows 

   net cash flows provided by operating activities for all businesses excluding the securities clearing and outsourcing services segment were 16918 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to 16264 million in fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily due to the increase in net earnings from all businesses excluding the securities clearing and outsourcing services segment of 5018 million offset by the noncash gain on the sale of the claims services business of 4528 million additionally accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased primarily due to the timing of income tax payments which increased from approximately 4768 million in fiscal 2005 to 6756 million in fiscal 2006 offset in part by an increase in our income tax provision 

  net cash flows provided by operating activities for the securities clearing and outsourcing services segment were 1207 million in fiscal 2006 as compared with the net cash flows used in operating activities of 1930 million from november 1 2004 to june 30 2005 the net cash flows provided by operating activities primarily resulted from a decrease of 1644 million of securities deposited with clearing organizations or segregated for the exclusive benefit of our securities clearing and outsourcing services’ customers to meet regulatory requirements in addition securities clearing receivables decreased primarily due to the margin lending activities of the segment 

  cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 totaled 4522 million as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of 4379 million in fiscal 2005 the fluctuation between periods was primarily due to the proceeds received from our sale of the claims services business and the brokerage services’ financial print business during fiscal 2006 additionally the fluctuations in cash flows from investing activities were due to the timing of purchases of and proceeds from marketable securities and the change in client funds obligations 

  cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2006 totaled 13488 million as compared to 7465 million in fiscal 2005 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the increase in the amount of common stock purchased for treasury with a portion of the proceeds received in the united states from the sale of the claims services business and our cash flows from operations we accelerated our share buyback activity and purchased 296 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 4484 per share during fiscal 2006 as compared with 141 million shares at an average 

price of 4198 per share during fiscal 2005 as of june 30 2006 we had remaining board of directors’ authorization to purchase up to 340 million additional shares the increase in the cash flows used from financing activities was offset in part by an increase in the proceeds received from the stock purchase plan and exercises of stock options in fiscal 2006 

  in june 2006 we entered into a 175 billion 364day credit agreement and a 225 billion fiveyear credit agreement with a group of lenders the fiveyear facility contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by 5000 million to 275 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments these facilities replaced the company’s prior 125 billion 364day facility and 225 billion fiveyear facility both of which were terminated on june 28 2006 the 175 billion and 225 billion agreements mature in june 2007 and june 2011 respectively we also have a 15 billion credit facility that matures in june 2010 the interest rate applicable to the borrowings is tied to libor or prime rate depending on the notification provided by the company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing we are also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and to provide funding for general corporate purposes if necessary there were no borrowings through june 30 2006 under the current or prior credit agreements 

  we maintain a us shortterm commercial paper program providing for the issuance of up to 50 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper at the company’s discretion our commercial paper program is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and prime 1 by moody’s these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 270 days at june 30 2006 and 2005 there was no commercial paper outstanding during fiscal 2006 and 2005 the company’s average borrowings were 14 billion and 10 billion respectively at a weighted average interest rate of 41 and 21 respectively the weighted average maturity of the company’s commercial paper during fiscal 2006 and 2005 was less than two days for both fiscal years 

  our us and canadian shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of repurchase agreements which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days at june 30 2006 and 2005 there were no outstanding obligations under repurchase agreements during fiscal 2006 and 2005 the company had average outstanding balances under repurchase agreements of 1657 million and 3002 million respectively at an average interest rate of 35 and 19 respectively 

  during fiscal 2006 we borrowed 2001 million from a financial institution on a shortterm basis in connection with dealer services’ acquisition of kerridge computer company ltd we repaid the shortterm borrowing in full as of december 31 2005 

  capital expenditures for continuing operations during fiscal 2006 were 2892 million as compared to 1941 million in fiscal 2005 and 1880 million in fiscal 2004 the capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 related primarily to data center and other facility improvements to support our operations we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 to be approximately 250 million 

  the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of june 30 2006 

 1 these amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our consolidated balance sheets see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters 

2 included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment as well as the licensing of software the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements 

3 purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software equipment and other assets 

4 compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements 

  in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above we have obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services as of june 30 2006 the obligations relating to these matters which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2007 total 177874 million and are recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets we have 174839 million of cash and marketable securities recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2006 that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations 

  the company’s whollyowned subsidiary adp indemnity inc provides workers’ compensation and employer liability insurance coverage for our peo worksite employees we have secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from thirdparty carriers that cap losses that reach a certain level in each policy year we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo business we review the assumptions and obtain valuations provided by an independent thirdparty actuary to determine the adequacy of the workers’ compensation reserve during fiscal 2006 and 2005 we received premiums of 465 million and 540 million respectively and paid claims of 219 million and 159 million respectively at june 30 2006 our cash balances and marketable securities balances totaled approximately 1485 million to cover potential future workers’ compensation claims for the policy years that the peo worksite employees were covered by adp indemnity inc we believe that the workers’ compensation reserve is adequate to cover the workers’ compensation claim liability for the peo worksite employees covered 

  it is not the company’s business practice to enter into offbalance sheet arrangements however in the normal course of business the company enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the company’s products and services in addition the securities transactions of the securities clearing and outsourcing services segment involve collateral arrangements required by various regulatory and internal guidelines which are monitored daily the company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties or collateral arrangements 

  we are a member of numerous exchanges and clearinghouses under the membership agreements members are generally required to guarantee the performance of other members additionally if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearinghouse other members would be required to meet these shortfalls to mitigate these performance risks the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral our maximum potential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified however we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make payments under these arrangements accordingly no contingent liability is recorded in the consolidated financial statements for these arrangements 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities and longterm marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 

  in order to provide more costeffective liquidity and maximize our interest income we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ shortterm financing arrangements to satisfy our shortterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations in these instances a portion of this portfolio is considered and reported within the corporate investment balances in order to reflect the pure client funds assets and related obligations interest income on this portfolio and the related interest expense on the borrowings are reported in other income net on our statements of consolidated earnings 

  our corporate investments are invested in highly liquid investment grade securities these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury andor acquisitions as well as other corporate operating purposes the majority of our shortterm and longterm marketable securities are classified as availableforsale securities 

  our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal liquidity and diversification as the primary goals while also seeking to maximize interest income client funds assets are invested in highly liquid investment grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase a significant portion of the client funds assets are invested in us government agencies securities 

  we have established credit quality maturity and exposure limits for our investments the minimum allowed credit rating for fixed income securities is singlea the maximum maturity at time of purchase for a singlea rated security is 5 years for aarated securities is 7 years and for aaarated securities is 10 years commercial paper must be rated a1p1 and for time deposits banks must have a financial strength rating of c or better 

  details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows 

   during fiscal 2006 approximately 20 of our overall investment portfolio was invested in cash and cash equivalents and therefore is impacted by changes in shortterm interest rates the other 80 of our investment portfolio was invested in fixedincome securities with varying maturities of 10 years or less which were also subject to interest rate risk including reinvestment risk 

  factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include among others the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and longterm investments this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes a hypothetical change in both shortterm interest rates  eg  overnight interest rates or fed funds rates and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2007 average investment balances and any related borrowings would result in approximately a 10 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelvemonth period a hypothetical change in only shortterm interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2007 average shortterm investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a 4 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelvemonth period 

  the company is exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities the company limits credit risk by investing primarily in aaa and aa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and for canadian securities dominion bond rating service in addition we also limit amounts that can be invested in any single issuer at june 30 2006 approximately 95 of our availableforsale securities held a aaa or aa rating 

  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position results of operations and cash flows the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 

  in the normal course of business the securities clearing activities of the securities clearing and outsourcing services segment provides trade execution settlement and financing of various security clearing transactions for a nationwide client base with these activities we may be exposed to risk in the event customers other brokerdealers banks clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations for securities clearing activities of the securities clearing and outsourcing services segment in which we extend credit to customers and brokerdealers we seek to control the risk associated with these activities by requiring customers and brokerdealers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines we monitor margin levels and pursuant to such guidelines request the deposit of additional collateral or the reduction of securities positions when necessary in addition brokerdealers may be required to maintain deposits relating to any securities clearing activities we perform on their behalf 

  we record customers’ security clearing transactions on a settlement date basis which is generally three business days after trade date the company is therefore exposed to offbalance sheet risk of loss on unsettled transactions in the event customers and other counterparties are unable to fulfill contractual obligations 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  as previously discussed we adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” effective july 1 2005 using the modified prospective method the adoption of this standard requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 

  in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 applies to all tax positions accounted for under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “morelikelythannot” to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date if a tax position is not considered “morelikelythannot” to be sustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognized fin 48 requires additional annual disclosures and is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin 48 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

  in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections – a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” “sfas no 154” which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle and error corrections sfas no 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 the company adopted sfas no 154 on july 1 2006 and will apply its provisions on a prospective basis when applicable 

  in march 2005 the fasb issued fin no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 143” “fin 47” fin 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated fin 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in sfas no 143 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity fin 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 the adoption of fin 47 as of june 30 2006 did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

critical accounting policies 

  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

  revenue recognition our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services  eg  employer services’ payroll processing fees and brokerage services’ trade processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds payroll tax filing funds and other employer services’ clientrelated funds we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction  eg  number of payees or number of trades fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions which do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for employer services’ clients is recognized in revenues as earned as the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 

  we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses for a majority of our software sales arrangements which provide hardware software licenses installation and postcontract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendorspecific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

  we assess collectibility of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis as well as the customer’s payment history we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectibility determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 

  goodwill we review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment when determining fair value we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions including projections of revenues based on assumed longterm growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the company’s weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process we had 24662 million of goodwill as of june 30 2006 given the significance of our goodwill an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings 

  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns  eg  realization of deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

  stockbased compensation sfas no 123r requires the measurement of stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binominal optionpricing model the binomial optionpricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility dividend yield riskfree interest rate and employee exercise behavior expected volatilities utilized in the binomial optionpricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities historical volatility of the company’s stock price and other factors similarly the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes the riskfree rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the binomial optionpricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding determining these assumptions are subjective and complex and therefore a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options prior to july 1 2005 we followed apb no 25 and related interpretations under apb no 25 no stockbased compensation expense was recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and with respect to the employee stock purchase plan the discount did not exceed fifteen percent

  adp carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of adp’s management including its chief executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of adp’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities and exchange act of 1934 based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that adp’s disclosure controls and procedures as of june 30 2006 were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by adp in reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  it is the responsibility of automatic data processing inc’s “adp” management to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to adp’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

  adp’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of adp ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of adp are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of adp and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of adp’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of adp 

  because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

  management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of adp’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 based upon criteria set forth in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment management determined that adp’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2006

  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended june 30 2006 of the company and our report dated august 28 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the company’s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” as revised effective july 1 2005

conditions  among  selected  clients  and  groups of  clients  may and do have a
temporary impact on demand for adps services in fiscal 2005 employer services

an increase in the number of employees on our clients  payrolls  strong growth
in its beyond  payroll  products  and improved  client  retention  brokerage

communication  services  resulting  from an increase in the amount of holders of
equities and an increase in mutual fund special communications  dealer services
grew due to the revenues  generated in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 acquisitions
and  growth in its  traditional  businesses  and our  investment  income on our
client funds  increased due to the increase in our average  client fund balances
and higher interest rates

     the  computing  services  industry is highly  competitive  adp knows of no
reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors but
it believes that it is one of the largest providers of computerized  transaction
processing data communication and information services in the world

     adps competitors  include other independent  computing services companies
divisions of diversified  enterprises and banks  another  competitive factor in
the computing  services industry is the inhouse computing  function  whereby a
company installs and operates its own computing systems

     competition  in the  computing  services  industry  is  primarily  based on
service responsiveness  product quality and price adp believes that it is very
competitive  in each of these  areas  and that  there are no  material  negative
factors impacting adps competitive position in the computing services industry
no one competitor or group of competitors is dominant in the computing  services
industry

clients and client contracts

     adp provides its services to approximately 590000 clients in fiscal 2005
no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess
of 2 of annual consolidated revenues

     adp has no material  backlog because the period between the time a client
agrees to use adps  services and the time the service  begins is generally very
short and because no sale is  considered  firm until it is installed  and begins
producing  revenue  adp receives  sales orders in all of our  businesses and is
continuously  in the  process  of  performing  implementation  services  for our
clients  depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client  the
installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period
of time up to two weeks for an sbs client to a longer period generally six to
twelve months for a national  account  services or dealer  services client with
multiple deliverables

     adps  average  client  retention  is  estimated  at more  than 8 years  in
employer  services  and is 10 or more  years in  brokerage  services  and dealer
services and does not vary significantly from period to period

     adps  services are provided  under  written  price  quotations  or service
agreements  having  varying  terms and  conditions  no one price  quotation  or
service agreement is material to adp discounts  rebates and promotions offered
by adp to clients are not material

systems development and programming

     during the fiscal  years ended june 30 2005  2004 and 2003  adp invested
696  million  704  million  and  604  million   respectively  in  systems
development and  programming  migration to new computing  technologies  and the
development  of new  products  and  maintenance  of our  existing  technologies
including purchases of new software and software licenses

product development

     adp continually  upgrades  enhances and expands its existing  products and
services generally no new product or service has a significant effect on adps
revenues or negatively  impacts its existing  products and  services  and adps
products and services have a significant remaining life cycle

     it is the  responsibility  of automatic  data  processing  incs  adp
management to establish and maintain  effective  internal control over financial
reporting as defined in rule  13a15f  under the  securities  exchange act of
1934  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide
reasonable  assurance to adps  management and board of directors  regarding the
preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles

     adps internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures  that i pertain to the  maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail  accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the
assets of adp ii provide reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit  preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with
generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of
adp are being made only in accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and
directors  of  adp  and  iii  provide  reasonable   assurance  regarding  the
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized  acquisition  use or disposition
of adps assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of
adp

reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation

internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as of june 30  2005  based  upon
criteria  set forth in internal  control   integrated  framework  issued by the
committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  based on this
assessment  management  determined  that adps internal  control over financial
reporting was effective as of june 30 2005

europe  some services within the employer services and brokerage services
business units are also offered in australia and asia and employer services

base or market  for example brokerage services serves a large client base in
the financial services industry including retail and institutional firms banks

automobile dealers but also serves truck powersports ie motorcycle marine

of clients in specific industries  employer services also sells to auto
dealers brokerage clients and insurance clients  while concentrations of
clients exist no one client or industry group is material to adps overall
revenues

         none of adps businesses are overly sensitive to price changes
economic conditions among selected clients and groups of clients may and do have
a temporary impact on demand for adps services  in fiscal 2004 despite the
continued impact of weak economic conditions employer services continued to
grow primarily due to the increase in its united states payroll and payroll tax
businesses including strong growth in its beyond payroll products and
improved client retention brokerage services grew as a consequence of the
increased volume in its investor communication services resulting from increased
communications relating to recent mutual fund regulatory activity and increased
trading activity dealer services grew due to new product growth in its
traditional business however the growth of adps business units was offset by
the decline in interest rates over the past year which resulted in a decrease
in investment income on our client and corporate funds

and does not believe any major service or business unit in adp is subject to
unique market risk

competition

         the computing services industry is highly competitive  adp knows of no
reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors but
it believes that it is one of the largest providers of computerized transaction
processing data communication and information services in the world

         adps competitors include other independent computing services
companies divisions of diversified enterprises and banks another competitive
factor in the computing services industry is the inhouse computing function
whereby a company installs and operates its own computing systems

         competition in the computing services industry is primarily based on
service responsiveness product quality and price adp believes that it is very
competitive in each of these areas and that there are no material negative
factors impacting adps competitive position in the computing services industry
no one competitor or group of competitors is dominant in the computing services
industry

industries employer services also sells to auto dealers brokerage clients and
insurance clients while concentrations of clients exist no one client or
business group is material to adps overall revenues

economic conditions among selected clients and groups of clients may and do have
a temporary impact on demand for adps services in fiscal 2003 despite the

peo business and improved client retention in brokerage services weakness in

activities and interest rates in the us continued to decline over the last
fiscal year significantly impacting interest earnings on our client and
corporate funds

         adp enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings
and does not believe any major service or business unit in adp is subject to
unique market risk

competition

         the computing services industry is highly competitive adp knows of no
reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors but
it believes that it is one of the largest providers of computerized transaction
processing data communication and information services in the world

         adps competitors include other independent computing services
companies divisions of diversified enterprises and banks another competitive
factor in the computing services industry is the inhouse computing function
whereby a company installs and operates its own computing systems

         competition in the computing services industry is primarily based on
service responsiveness product quality and price adp believes that it is very
competitive in each of these areas and that there are no material negative
factors impacting adps competitive position in the computing services industry
no one competitor or group of competitors is dominant in the computing services
industry

clients and client contracts

2003 no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in
excess of 2 of annual consolidated revenues

         adp has no material backlog because the period between the time a
client agrees to use adps services and the time the service begins is generally
very short depending on the service agreement andor the size of the client
the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short
period of time up to two weeks for an sbs client to a longer period generally
six to twelve months for a national accounts services or dealer services client
with multiple deliverables

         adps average client retention is more than 8 years in employer
services and is 10 or more years in brokerage services and dealer services and
does not vary significantly from period to period

         adps services are provided under written price quotations or service
agreements having varying terms and conditions no one price quotation or
service agreement is material to adp discounts rebates and promotions offered
by adp to clients are not material

adps revenues or negatively impacts its existing products and services and
adps products and services have a significant remaining life cycle

markets and marketing methods

     all of adps services are offered broadly across north america and
europe some employer services and brokerage services are also offered in south
america primarily brazil australia and asia

     none of adps major business groups have a single homogenous client
base or market for example while brokerage services primarily serves the
retail brokerage market it also serves banks commodity dealers the
institutional brokerage market and individual nonbrokerage corporations dealer
services primarily serves automobile dealers but also serves truck and
agricultural equipment dealers auto repair shops used car lots state
departments of motor vehicles and manufacturers of automobiles trucks and
agricultural equipment claims services has many clients who are insurance
companies but it also provides services to automobile manufacturers body
repair shops salvage yards distributors of new and used automobile parts and
other noninsurance clients employer services has clients from a large variety
of industries and markets within this client base are concentrations of clients
in specific industries employer services also sells to auto dealers brokerage
clients and insurance clients while concentrations of clients exist no one
client or business group is material to adps overall revenues

     none of adps businesses are overly sensitive to price changes
economic conditions among selected clients and groups of clients may and do have
a temporary impact on demand for adps services in fiscal 2002 in employer
services the continued weak economic conditions resulted in slower sales lower
client retention due primarily to bankruptcies and fewer employees on our
clients payrolls in brokerage services weakness in the brokerage and
financial services industry significantly reduced discretionary spending and
investments in new initiatives and the change in the mix of retail versus
institutional transactions lowered revenue per trade and interest rates in the
us declined precipitously last year significantly impacting interest earnings
on our client funds

     adp enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings
and does not believe any major service or business unit in adp is subject to
unique market risk

competition

     the computing services industry is highly competitive adp knows of no
reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors but
it believes that it is one of the largest providers of computerized transaction
processing data communication and information services in the world

     adps competitors include other independent computing services
companies divisions of diversified enterprises and banks another competitive
factor in the computing services industry is the inhouse computing function
whereby a company installs and operates its own computing systems

     competition in the computing services industry is primarily based on
service responsiveness product quality and price adp believes that it is very
competitive in each of these areas and that there are no material negative
factors impacting adps competitive position in the computing services industry
no one competitor or group of competitors is dominant in the computing services
industry

clients and client contracts

     adp provides its services to over 500000 clients in fiscal 2002 no
single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of
2 of annual consolidated revenues

                                   6
page

     adp has no material backlog because the period between the time a
client agrees to use adps services and the time the service begins is generally
very short and because no sale is considered firm until it is installed and
begins producing revenue

     adps average client retention is more than 8 years in employer services
and is 10 or more years in brokerage services and dealer services and does not
vary significantly from period to period

     adps services are provided under written price quotations or service
agreements having varying terms and conditions no one price quotation or
service agreement is material to adp discounts rebates and promotions offered
by adp to clients are not material

     adp offers a service warranty to its clients that if any errors or
omissions occur in its service offerings adp will correct them as soon as
possible in addition adp provides either directly or through third parties
maintenance and support for the adp provided equipment and software that
facilitates the delivery of its services to clients

invested 475 million 514 million and 460 million respectively in systems
development and programming migration to new computing technologies and the
development of new products

product development

and services generally no new product or service has a significant effect on
adps revenues or negatively impacts its existing products and services and
adps products and services have a significant remaining life cycle

and databases adps business is not dependent upon a single license or group of
licenses thirdparty licenses patents trademarks and franchises are not
material to adps business as a whole

2002 annual report to shareholders which information is incorporated herein by
reference



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     approximately 30 of the registrants overall investment portfolio is
invested in overnight interestbearing instruments which are therefore impacted
immediately by changes in interest rates the other 70 of the registrants
investment portfolio is invested in fixedincome securities with maturities of
up to ten years which are also subject to interest rate risk including
reinvestment risk the registrant has historically had the ability to hold these
investments until maturity and therefore this has not had an adverse impact on
income or cash flows

     the earnings impact of future rate changes is not precisely predictable
because many factors influence the return on the registrants portfolio these
factors include among others the overall portfolio mix between shortterm and
longterm investments the mix varies during the year and is impacted by daily
interest rate changes a hypothetical change in interest rates of 25 basis
points applied to the forecasted average balances in fiscal 2003 would result in
approximately a 9 million pretax earnings impact over the twelvemonth period
