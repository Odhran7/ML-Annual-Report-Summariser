acquisitions during 2021 

below is a listing of our acquisitions in the us and europe for the year ended december 31 2021 excludes properties assumed on november 1 2021 in conjunction with our merger with vereit 



1 the initial weighted average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a client could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above contractual net operating income used in the calculation of initial average cash yield includes approximately 85 million received as settlement credits for 41 properties as reimbursement of free rent periods for the year ended december 31 2021 

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the initial average cash lease yield is computed as follows estimated cash net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs

impact of covid19 

we continue to work diligently with our clients most affected by the pandemic to understand their business operations and financial liquidity and their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations to us as we carefully navigate this difficult economic period with our clients our focus is on finding resolutions that preserve the longterm relationships we have built with many of our clients see item 1a—risk factors in part i of this report for more information regarding the actual and potential future impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread on our clients and our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

the majority of lease concessions granted to our clients during 2020 and 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic have been rent deferrals with the original lease term unchanged in these cases we have determined that the collection of deferred rent is probable within the meaning applicable under generally accepted accounting principles gaap although we cannot assure you that this determination will not change in the future in addition as we believe to be the case with many retail landlords we have received many shortterm rent relief requests most often in the form of rent deferral requests or requests for further discussion from clients we believe that not all client requests will ultimately result in lease modification agreements nor have we relinquished our contractual rights under our lease agreements where rent concessions have not yet been granted our rent collections for the periods below and rent relief requests todate may not be indicative of collections concessions or requests in any future period 

table of contents 

percentages of contractual rent collected as of december 31 2021 



1 collection rates are calculated as the aggregate contractual rent collected for the applicable period from the beginning of that applicable period through december 31 2021 divided by the contractual rent charged for the applicable period rent collection percentages are calculated based on contractual rent excluding percentage rents and contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients charged amounts have not been adjusted for any covid19 related rent relief granted and include contractual rent from any clients in bankruptcy due to differences in applicable foreign currency conversion rates and rent conventions the percentages above may differ from percentages calculated utilizing our total portfolio annualized contractual rent 

2 we define our top 20 clients as our 20 largest clients based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent as of december 31 2021 for all periods 

3 we define investment grade clients as clients with a credit rating and our clients that are subsidiaries or affiliates of companies with a credit rating as of the balance sheet date of baa3bbb or higher from one of the three major rating agencies moody’sspfitch 

as the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread continue to evolve the ability of our clients to continue to pay rent to us may further diminish and therefore we cannot assure you that our historical rental collections are indicative of our rental collections in the future as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread our revenues in the foreseeable future may decline and that decline may continue or increase in subsequent periods as long as such impacts continue to exist 

select financial results

dividend policy 

distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock 

distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of realty income lp each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders 

in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2021 our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 117 billion or approximately 1491 of our estimated taxable income of 7847 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our cash on hand and funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our cash distributions to common stockholders in 2021 totaled 117 billion representing 785 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 149 billion in comparison our 2020 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 9642 million representing 822 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 117 billion 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo normalized ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year however noncorporate stockholders including individuals generally may deduct up to 20 of dividends from a reit other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 673 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2021 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes

business philosophy and strategy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income a net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on 1 fixed increases 2 increases tied to inflation typically subject to ceilings or 3 additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm net lease agreements with our commercial clients generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy we believe that diversification of the portfolio by client industry geography and property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio that as of december 31 2021 consisted of 11136 properties located in all 50 us states puerto rico the uk and spain and doing business in 60 industries none of the 60 industries represented in our property portfolio accounted for more than 91 of our annualized contractual rent as of december 31 2021 

with expanded scale from our merger with vereit we hope to serve our existing clients better and to partner with new clients that require the larger and more diversified balance sheet we now provide equally as we look to continue to expand geographically across europe we hope to partner with new multinational clients that seek a real estate partner with an expanding geographic footprint 

investment strategy 

we seek to invest in highquality real estate that our clients consider important to the successful operation of their businesses we generally seek to acquire commercial real estate that has some or all of the following characteristics 

• properties in markets or locations important to our clients 

• properties that we deem to be profitable for our clients eg retail stores or revenue generating sites 

• properties with strong demographic attributes relative to the specific business drivers of our clients 

• properties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs 

• properties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents for similar properties 

• properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm net lease agreements offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases 

• properties that leverage relationships with clients sellers investors or developers as part of a longterm strategy and 

• properties that leverage our proprietary insights including predictive analytics eg through the selection of locations and geographic markets we expect to remain strong or strengthen in the future 

we typically seek to invest in properties owned or leased by clients that are already or could become leaders in their respective businesses supported by mechanisms including but not limited to occupancy of prime real estate locations pricing merchandise assortment service quality economies of scale consumer branding ecommerce and advertising in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of properties net leased to different clients operating in a variety of industries we have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities often using our relationships with various clients ownersdevelopers brokers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions we also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations clients and industries for investment this research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value 

in selecting potential investments we generally look for clients with the following attributes 

• reliable and sustainable cash flow including demonstrated economic resiliency 

• revenue and cash flow from multiple sources 

• are willing to sign a longterm lease 10 or more years and 

• are large owners and users of real estate 

from a retail perspective our investment strategy is to target clients that have a service nondiscretionary andor lowpricepoint component to their business our investments are usually with clients who have demonstrated 

table of contents 

resiliency to ecommerce or have a strong omni channel retail strategy uniting brickandmortar and mobile browsing both of which reflect the continued importance of last mile retail the movement of goods to its final destination real estate as part of a customer experience and supply chain strategy our overall investments including last mile retail are driven by an optimal portfolio strategy that among other considerations targets allocation ranges by asset class and industry we review our strategy periodically and stress test our portfolio in a variety of positive and negative economic scenarios to ensure we deliver consistent earnings growth and value creation across economic cycles as a result of the execution of this strategy approximately 92 of our annualized retail contractual rent on december 31 2021 is derived from our clients with a service nondiscretionary andor low price point component to their business from a nonretail perspective we target industrial properties leased to industry leaders the majority of which are investment grade rated companies we believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties 

after applying this investment strategy we pursue those transactions where we believe we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable riskadjusted returns we will continue to evaluate all investments for consistency with our objective of owning net lease assets 

underwriting strategy 

in order to be considered for acquisition properties must meet stringent underwriting requirements we have established a fourpart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

• the aforementioned overall real estate characteristics including demographics replacement cost and comparative rental rates 

• industry client including credit profile and market conditions 

• store profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available and 

• the importance of the real estate location to the operations of the clients’ business 

we believe the principal financial obligations for most of our clients typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to employees suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a client conducts its business or which are critical to the client’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a client’s lease obligation is less than the client’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that clients must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive therefore in the event of reorganization we believe they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property 

thus as the property owner we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same client in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by our client during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new client or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of our clients’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition 

we conduct comprehensive reviews of the business segments and industries in which our clients’ operate prior to entering into any transaction our research department conducts a review of a client’s credit quality the information reviewed may include reports and filings including any public credit ratings financial statements debt and equity analyst reports and reviews of corporate credit spreads stock prices market capitalization and other financial metrics we conduct additional due diligence including additional financial reviews of the client and continue to monitor our clients’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed and providing summaries of these findings to management 

at december 31 2021 approximately 44 of our annualized contractual rent comes from properties leased to our investment grade clients their subsidiaries or affiliated companies at december 31 2021 our top 20 clients based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent represented approximately 43 of our annualized rent and 12 of these clients have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries or affiliates of investment grade companies 

asset management strategy 

in addition to pursuing new properties for investment we seek to increase earnings and dividends through active asset management

generally our asset management efforts seek to achieve 

• rent increases at the expiration of existing leases when market conditions permit 

• optimum exposure to certain clients industries and markets through releasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties 

• maximum assetlevel returns on properties that are released or sold 

• additional value creation from the existing portfolio by enhancing individual properties pursuing alternative uses and deriving ancillary revenue and 

• investment opportunities in new asset classes for the portfolio 

we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our clients our clients’ industries and the real estate locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality our active asset management strategy pursues asset sales when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

• generate higher returns 

• enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

• extend our average remaining lease term andor 

• strategically decrease client industry or geographic concentration 

the active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy of maintaining high occupancy 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock longterm unsecured notes and bonds term loans under our revolving credit facility and preferred stock over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may also raise funds from debt or other equity securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facility commercial paper program or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowings on our credit facility and under our commercial paper program and through public securities offerings 

we may choose to mitigate our financial exposure to exchange rate risk for properties acquired outside the us through the issuance of debt securities denominated in the same local currency and through currency derivatives we may leave a portion of our foreign cash flow unhedged to reinvest in additional properties in the same local currency 

for 2022 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio we plan to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during 2022 or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties

• a complete or partial closure of or other operational limitations or issues at properties operated by our clients resulting from government action including travel bans border closings business closures quarantine vaccine and testing requirements shelterinplace or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes or client action 

• reduced economic activity customer traffic consumer confidence or discretionary spending the deterioration in our or our clients’ ability to operate in affected areas and any delays in the supply of products or services to our clients may impact certain of our clients’ businesses results of operations financial condition and liquidity and may cause certain of our clients to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full or at all and to seek whether through negotiation restructuring or bankruptcy reductions or deferrals in their rent payments and other obligations to us or early termination of their leases 

• we may experience difficulties some of which may be related to supply chain disruptions in leasing selling or redeveloping vacant properties or renewing expiring or terminated leases on terms we consider acceptable or at all 

• we may experience difficulty accessing the bank lending capital markets and other financial markets on attractive terms or at all and a severe disruption or instability in the national or global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions may adversely affect our cost of capital our access to capital to grow our business including through acquisitions development opportunities and other strategic transactions and to fund our business operations our ability to pay dividends on our common stock our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness and our other liabilities on a timely basis and our clients’ ability to fund their business operations and meet their obligations to us and others 

• the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic could negatively impact our credit ratings the interest rates on our borrowings and our future compliance with financial covenants under our credit facility and other debt instruments which could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness any of which could 

table of contents 

negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility to sell commercial paper notes under our commercial paper program or incur other indebtedness and pay dividends on our common stock and to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness and our other obligations when due 

• the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the market value of our properties has led to impairment charges and may require that we incur further impairment charges asset writedowns or similar charges 

• the impact on the ability of our employees including members of our management team or board of directors to fulfill their duties to us as a result of the covid19 pandemic either as a result of measures taken to limit its spread or as a result of infection and 

• a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability to grow our portfolio of properties 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and those of our clients will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the scope severity and duration of the pandemic the actions taken to contain the pandemic or limit its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures to date the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact among other things the ability of a number of our clients’ to generate adequate or in certain cases any revenue from their businesses the ability or willingness of many of our clients to pay rent in full or at all or on a timely basis and our ability to collect rent from our clients it may also adversely impact our ability to enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent our occupancy levels our ability to acquire properties or complete construction projects and may otherwise negatively affect our business 

most of our clients operate retail businesses many of which appear to have been disproportionately impacted by the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its spread these adverse impacts have at times reduced the amount of rent we have been able to collect from our clients in those industries and may further decrease the likelihood of us collecting such rent in the future in addition if any of these or other clients declare bankruptcy or enter into similar corporate restructuring arrangements they may seek to reject or renegotiate our existing leases which could adversely affect our ability to collect rent that is owed or to collect future rent on those properties at anticipated rates or at all or to release those properties on favorable terms 

in addition most of our clients operate retail businesses that depend on customer traffic as a result conditions that lead to a decline in customer traffic including quarantine shelterinplace or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes or orders requiring business closures or restricting business operations have had and so long as those conditions continue to exist will continue to have an adverse effect on the business results of operations financial condition and liquidity of a number of our clients and their willingness or ability to pay rent to renew expiring leases or to enter into new leases on terms favorable to us or at all 

in addition to the nearterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on our clients and their businesses we are unable to predict at this time the broader longterm impacts on consumer behavior in regard to brickandmortar retail and servicebased businesses to the extent certain adverse factors including but not limited to continued patterns of consumer savings and unemployment persist certain discretionary businesses could have prolonged negative consequences as a result of shifts in longterm consumer behavior 

as a result of the foregoing we cannot predict the number of our clients that will not pay rent in the future nor can we predict whether our clients who have paid rent in the past will continue to do so or whether our clients who have deferred rent will pay such rent in the future as the covid19 pandemic continues our clients may cease to pay their rent obligations to us in full or at all and our clients may elect not to renew their leases seek to terminate their leases seek relief from their leases including through negotiation restructuring or bankruptcy or decline to renew expiring leases or enter into new leases all of which may adversely impact our rental revenue and occupancy rates generate additional expenses result in impairment charges or other writedowns of assets and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition as we believe to be the case with many retail landlords we have received and may continue to receive shortterm rent relief requests most often in the form of rent deferral requests or requests for further discussion from our clients collections and rent relief requests todate may not be indicative of collections or requests in any future period 

likewise the deterioration of global economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may ultimately lead to a further decrease in occupancy levels and rental rates across our portfolio as our clients reduce or defer their spending institute restructuring plans or file for bankruptcy some of our major clients have experienced temporary closures of some or all of their properties or have substantially altered or reduced their operations in response to the covid19 pandemic and additional clients may do so in the future in addition the measures taken to prevent the spread of 

table of contents 

covid19 including quarantine shelterinplace or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes have led and may lead to further closures or other operational issues or changes at our properties or delays in acquisition activities construction projects and other corporate actions all of which may materially adversely impact our operations 

in addition in light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the covid19 pandemic we have taken certain precautionary measures within our organization intended to help reduce the risk of the virus to our employees our clients and the communities in which we operate including instituting a workfromhome policy for our employees and limiting nonessential travel and inperson attendance at industry events 

while we anticipate that these measures are temporary we cannot predict the specific duration for which these precautionary measures will stay in effect and we may elect to take additional measures as the information available to us continues to develop these actions and any future actions we may take in response to the covid19 pandemic could further negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

for the foregoing reasons we expect that the impact of the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures including the impact on regional national and global economies may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity and given unpredictability of the scope severity and duration of the pandemic such impacts may be material 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures continue to adversely affect regional national and global economic conditions and financial markets as well as the business results of operations financial conditions and liquidity of us and our clients they may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section including the risks resulting from our significant indebtedness our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness to pay dividends on our common stock to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness and provide for our other cash needs our ongoing need for external financing our ability to access borrowings under our credit facility and to sell notes under our commercial paper program our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness our ability to integrate vereit’s business or realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the merger our dependency on key personnel and the impact of negative market conditions or adverse events on our clients in addition in light of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread our historical information regarding our business properties results of operations financial condition or liquidity may not be representative of the future results of operations financial condition liquidity or other financial or operating results of us our properties or our business 

in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

  we face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties we expect competition from 

• businesses 

• individuals 

• fiduciary accounts and plans and 

• other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential clients or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new clients release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to our clients on economically favorable terms and to collect rent from our clients on a timely basis we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

• lack of demand in areas where our properties are located 

• inability to retain existing clients and attract new clients 

• oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates 

• declines in our clients’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent which may be affected by their operations economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators 

table of contents 

• defaults by and bankruptcies of clients failure of clients to pay rent on a timely basis or failure of our clients to comply with their contractual obligations 

• changes in laws rules or regulations that negatively impact clients or our properties 

• the current covid19 pandemic see “risk factors — the covid19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity” above or other pandemics or outbreaks of illness disease or virus that affect countries or regions in which our clients and their parent companies operate or in which our properties or corporate headquarters are located 

• economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located and 

• deterioration of physical condition of our properties 

at any time any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a client may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any client bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of our client’s lease and material losses to us 

if our clients do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations improvements on behalf of the client or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and service our indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition our clients may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

further the occurrence of a client bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from our client’s lease or leases the occurrence of a client bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from our client’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize our client to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases although it is possible that we may not receive any unpaid future rent under terminated leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a client for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a client’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result client bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness 

as of december 31 2021  164 of our properties were available for lease or sale as of december 31 2021 no single client or group of our clients in the same industry accounted for more than 10 of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent downturns in any of our industries could adversely affect our clients which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock 

in addition some properties are leased to clients that may have limited financial and other resources and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses including any downturns that have resulted or may result from the covid19 pandemic or in the regional national or international economy 

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

• our knowledge of the contamination 

• the timing of the contamination 

table of contents 

• the cause of the contamination or 

• the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances certain of our other properties particularly those leased for industrialtype purposes may also involve operations or activities that could give rise to environmental liabilities 

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our clients ability to continue to operate that property or our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims although our leases generally require our clients to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the clients’ activities on the properties we could nevertheless be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our clients could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings that contain asbestos in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

while we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental contamination if environmental contamination should exist on any of our properties we could be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest in addition while we maintain environmental insurance policies it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation andor that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our clients are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of clients’ activities on the properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the clients generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements obtaining environmental insurance or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation however it is possible that one or more of our clients could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities 

if we fail to qualify as a reit it could adversely impact us and the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

we believe that commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot make any assurances that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

table of contents 

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

if we fail to satisfy any of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

• we would be required to pay regular united states or us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income 

• we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

• we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

• this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal state and in some cases foreign taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our investors 

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue services or the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect us or our investors including holders of our common stock or debt securities we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act or tcja has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders we are continuing to assess the potential impact of tcja on us as related regulations are proposed and finalized 

although a number of regulations related to tcja became final after 2017 there are still a number of proposed regulations open for comment and further changes may be made in light of changes in the us government the legislation is still unclear in some respects and could be subject to further potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation in addition state and local tax jurisdictions which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities are continuing to evaluate the legislation to determine their respective levels of conformity to the new law while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the tax legislation as a whole will have on us 

distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

table of contents 

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that under certain circumstances may be exchanged for shares of our common stock this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of or refinance the debt on the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain similarly we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

we are subject to risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and our 10 billion commercial paper program the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility also governs our 2500 million unsecured term loan facility due march 2024 our revolving credit facility grants us the option subject to obtaining lender commitments and other customary conditions to expand the borrowing limits thereunder to up to 40 billion in addition we have an unsecured commercial paper note program under which we may offer and sell up to 10 billion of commercial paper at any time we use our 30 billion revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes issued under the commercial paper program specifically we maintain unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility equal to the aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program from time to time we also may in the future enter into amendments and restatements of our current revolving credit facility and term loan facility or enter into new revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities and any such amended restated or replacement revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities may increase the amounts we are entitled to borrow subject to customary conditions compared to our current revolving credit facility and term loan facility or we may incur other indebtedness we may also in the future increase the size of our commercial paper program in addition as a result of the merger all outstanding secured indebtedness of vereit and its subsidiaries and all outstanding liabilities and other indebtedness of vereit and its subsidiaries including 465 billion of additional senior unsecured notes that were originally issued by vereit op substantially all of which were subsequently exchanged for senior unsecured notes issued by us became indebtedness and liabilities of ours or our subsidiaries as the case may be which has substantially increased the total secured indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries and the total liabilities and other indebtedness of our subsidiaries 

to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt or to pay dividends on our common stock we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan are variable and could therefore increase over time in addition commercial paper borrowings are shortterm obligations and the interest rate on newly issued commercial paper varies according to market conditions at the time of issuance we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and ongoing global financial uncertainties including the impact of covid19 and of the united 

table of contents 

kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union referred to as brexit we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

in addition our revolving credit facility our term loan facility and our mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock in particular our revolving credit facility and our 2500 million term loan facility all of which are governed by the same credit agreement provide that if an event of default as defined in the credit agreement exists we may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or any outstanding preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

• the sum of a 95 of our adjusted funds from operations as defined in the credit agreement for that period plus b the aggregate amount of cash distributions made to holders of our outstanding preferred stock if any for that period and 

• the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of any income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders 

except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our outstanding preferred stock if any with net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock the credit agreement further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement we and our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on except for a distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and b dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under the credit agreement were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness or prevent us from paying those dividends other distributions interest or principal altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit 

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock any outstanding preferred stock and our debt securities including 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 

• requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

if we default under a credit facility loan agreement or other debt instrument the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and in the case of secured indebtedness to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral moreover a default under a single loan or debt instrument may trigger crossdefault or cross acceleration provisions in other indebtedness and debt instruments giving the holders of such other indebtedness and debt instruments similar rights to demand immediate repayment and to seize and sell any collateral 

real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include

• the impacts of climate change and 

• acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

real estate property investments are illiquid we may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our acquisitions and expansion opportunities we are regularly engaged in the process of identifying analyzing underwriting and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements synergies or other benefits our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions 

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singleclient net lease retail locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states including in the united kingdom and spain and properties leased to our clients engaged in nonretail businesses these risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties new types of real estate locations and lease structures and the laws and culture of nonunited states jurisdictions 

we are subject to additional risks from our international investments 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire properties outside of the united states these investments may expose us to a variety of risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the united states our international investments are subject to additional risks including 

• the laws rules and regulations applicable in such jurisdictions outside of the united states including those related to property ownership by foreign entities 

• complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

• fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar and exchange controls

• political instability uncertainty over property rights civil unrest drug trafficking political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities 

if we are unable to adequately address these risks they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 

we may engage in development or expansion projects or invest in new assets which would subject us to additional risks that could negatively impact our operations 

we may engage in development or other expansion projects which could require us to raise additional capital and oversee state and local permitting a decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could prevent us from pursuing the development or expansion project additionally any such new development or expansion project may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect the inability to successfully complete development or expansion projects or to complete them on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in the future we may invest in new or different assets or enter into new transaction structures that may or may not be closely related to our current business these new assets and transaction structures may have new different or increased risks than what we are currently exposed to in our business and we may not be able to manage these risks successfully additionally when investing in such new assets or transaction structures we will be exposed to the risk that those assets or structures or the income generated thereby will affect our ability to meet the requirements to maintain our reit status if we are not able to successfully manage the risks associated with such new assets it could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties clients generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally clients are generally required at the client’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our clients are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our clients are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the client and the industry in which the client operates 

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the clients as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the clients fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss we do not carry insurance for certain losses and certain types of losses may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders we also face the risk that our insurance carriers 

table of contents 

may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

in addition although we obtain title insurance policies on our properties to help protect us and our properties against title defects such as adverse claims of ownership liens or other encumbrances there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property cause a financial misstatement or damage our reputation 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities while the majority of our leases are under a net lease structure some or all of such property taxes may not be collectible from our clients 

our business is subject to risks associated with climate change and our sustainability strategies 

the effects of climate change and a resulting shift to a lower carbon economy could present several climaterelated risks and opportunities for our business physical risks from climate change could result in both chronic and acute perils including but not limited to extreme weather changes in precipitation and temperature and rising sea levels all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time connectivity labor and supply chains could impact business continuity for ourselves and our clients this could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

in addition we seek to promote effective energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies and compliance with federal state and international laws and regulations related to climate change both internally and with our clients our sustainability strategies and efforts to comply with changes in federal state and international laws and regulations on climate change could result in significant capital expenditures to improve our existing properties or properties we may acquire any changes to such laws and regulations could also result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures at our properties if we are unable to comply with laws and regulations on climate change or implement effective sustainability strategies our reputation among our clients and investors may be damaged and we may incur fines andor penalties moreover there can be no assurance that any of our sustainability strategies will result in reduced operating costs higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter our existing clients from relocating to properties owned by our competitors 

we are subject to risks related to the discontinuance of libor 

certain of our existing debt instruments and other financial arrangements including our 30 billion revolving credit facility and our 2500 million term loan facility provide for borrowings to be made at variable interest rates that use the london interbank offered rate or libor or metrics derived from or related to libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings thereunder and we may incur additional 

table of contents 

indebtedness or enter into new financial arrangements that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate for borrowing thereunder likewise as part of our cash management practices we may from time to time invest available cash in financial instruments that use libor as a benchmark for calculating interest payments or other obligations thereunder 

libor is in the process of being discontinued while certain us dollar libor settings will continue to be published on the current basis until june 30 2023 all other libor settings either are no longer being published or are being published only for a limited time and only on a “synthetic” basis ie not on the basis of submissions made by panel banks the regulator of the administrator of libor has prohibited any new use of libor by firms subject to its supervision and certain regulators in the united states have stated that no new contracts using us dollar libor should be entered into after 2021 

while our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility include provisions for establishing alternative reference rates when libor is no longer be available the consequences of the adoption of any such alternative reference rates cannot be predicted and could have an adverse impact on the amount of interest and commitment fees that we pay under those facilities likewise the unavailability of libor may have an adverse impact on interest rates and other financing costs under other debt instruments and other financial obligations of ours as well as the market value of and the payments we receive under any liborlinked securities or investments that we may own from time to time in addition financial markets generally may be adversely affected by the discontinuation of libor the uncertainties regarding its discontinuation the alternative reference rates that are being or may be used in place of libor and other issues related to libor any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock 

our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to among other purposes assist us in maintaining our status as a reit for united states federal andor state income tax purposes for example our charter restricts any person from acquiring beneficial or constructive ownership of more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding shares of common stock these restrictions could have antitakeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

the value of certain of our investment in real property may be reduced as the result of the expiration or loss of local tax abatements tax credit programs or other governmental incentives 

certain of our investments have the benefit of governmental tax incentives aimed at inducing property users to relocate to incentivize development in areas and neighborhoods which have not historically seen robust commercial development the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act provided for such communities to be designated as qualified opportunity zones which are eligible for such tax benefits these incentives typically have specific sunset provisions and may be subject to governmental discretion in the eligibility or award of the applicable incentives the expiration of these incentive programs or the inability of potential clients or users to be eligible for or to obtain governmental approval of the incentives or the inability to remain compliant with such programs may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment cash flow and net income and may result in impairment charges 

risks relating to the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 

we may not be able to integrate vereit’s business successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 

the merger involved the combination of two companies which operated as independent public companies we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of vereit potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following 

• the inability to successfully combine the businesses of realty income and vereit in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the anticipated cost savings 

• lost sales and clients as a result of certain clients of either of realty income or vereit deciding not to do business with the combined company 

• the complexities associated with managing the combined company out of multiple locations and integrating personnel from the two companies

• the failure to retain key employees of either of the two companies and 

• performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by integrating realty income’s and vereit’s operations 

our historical and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements may not be representative of our results after the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 

the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement including the subsequent spinoff of orion were completed in november 2021 accordingly our historical financial statements and our operating results for the periods prior to such time do not give effect to those transactions in addition the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements related to such transactions that we have previously prepared were created for informational purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the financial position or results of operations that actually would have occurred had the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement been completed as of the dates indicated nor does it purport to be indicative of the future operating results or financial position of realty income after the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments which were based upon preliminary estimates to allocate the purchase price to vereit’s assets and liabilities and certain estimates and assumptions regarding the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement that realty income and vereit believe are reasonable under the circumstances in addition the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect other future events that occur after the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement including the costs related to the planned integration of the two companies and any future nonrecurring charges resulting from the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and do not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or expense efficiencies as a result we cannot assure you that our historical and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements will be representative of our results for future periods 

general risk factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control including 

• prevailing interest rates increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities 

• the market for similar securities issued by other reits 

• general economic political and financial market conditions 

• the financial condition performance and prospects of us our clients and our competitors 

• changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations 

• litigation and regulatory proceedings 

• changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us our competitors or our industry

• failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or if the effect of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on our results of operations or financial condition is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the united states trading markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

table of contents 

litigation risks could affect our business 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims including those that may arise out acquisitions development opportunities and other strategic transactions an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees in addition our success after the merger with vereit will depend in part upon our ability to retain executive officers and key employees who may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration following the merger or a desire not to remain with realty income the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry or retain employees to the same extent as in the past 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our clients our business or the united states or world generally 

if events like these were to occur they could materially interrupt our business operations cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and maintenance of records which may include personal identifying information although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the theft of intellectual property personal information or personal property such as in the event of cyberattacks or ransomware attacks any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations result in theft of company assets damage our reputation subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further while we carry cyber liability insurance such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses related to such events 

volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our internal controls over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets 

table of contents 

additionally as a result of our merger with vereit we are operating two separate erp systems to execute our financial reporting until we can complete a full data migration and complete the related testing we have started the process of integrating these two erp platforms into one primary system and expect to complete the implementation process during 2022 we have updated our internal controls over financial reporting as necessary to accommodate modifications to our business processes for these parallel erp systems as we work towards enhanced automated controls through a central platform however utilization of parallel erp systems has inherent risks which can complicate our financial reporting controls and potentially lead to breakdowns in data integrity this erp integration also has required and will continue to require significant capital and human resources to deploy in addition potential flaws in implementing the primary erp or in the failure of any portionmodule of the erp to meet our needs or provide appropriate controls may pose risks to our ability to operate successfully and efficiently and with an effective system of internal controls 

failures in our internal controls could result in adverse consequences in our financial reporting and operations including delays additional costs impairment in our ability to access capital adverse impacts to investor confidence regulatory review or litigation 

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot make any assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

historically there have been periods where the global equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of equity and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the equity or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the equity and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect our clients’ ability to pay rent in addition the uk governments plan to reform the retail price index rpi to align with the consumer price index cpih may result in a lower measure of inflation and in turn have a negative impact on our lease revenue currently tied to rpi in the uk

liquidity and capital resources 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock longterm unsecured notes and bonds term loans under our revolving credit facility and preferred stock over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may also raise funds from debt or other equity securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facility commercial paper program or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowings on our credit facility and under our commercial paper program and through public securities offerings 

we may choose to mitigate our financial exposure to exchange rate risk for properties acquired outside the us through the issuance of debt securities denominated in the same local currency and through currency derivatives we may leave a portion of our foreign cash flow unhedged to reinvest in additional properties in the same local currency

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods including the current market the global credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and global credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

acquisitions during 2021 

below is a listing of our acquisitions in the us and europe for the year ended december 31 2021 excludes properties assumed on november 1 2021 in conjunction with our merger with vereit 



1 the initial weighted average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a client could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that 

table of contents 

the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above contractual net operating income used in the calculation of initial average cash yield includes approximately 85 million received as settlement credits for 41 properties as reimbursement of free rent periods for the year ended december 31 2021 

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the initial weighted average cash lease yield is computed as follows estimated cash net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs 

2 none of our investments during 2021 caused any one client to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2021

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2021 we had 164 properties available for lease out of 11136 properties in our portfolio which represents a 985 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio 

below is a summary of our portfolio activity for the periods indicated below 





1 includes 103 net vacancies assumed from the combined effect of our merger with vereit and spinoff of office properties to orion office reit inc in november 2021 

2 includes scheduled and unscheduled expirations including leases rejected in bankruptcy as well as future expirations resolved in the periods indicated above 

during the three months ended december 31 2021 the annual new rent on releases was 4909 million as compared to the previous annual rent of 4822 million on the same units representing a rent recapture rate of 1018 on the units released we released six units to new clients without a period of vacancy and nine units to new clients after a period of vacancy 

during the year ended december 31 2021 the annual new rent on releases was 8923 million as compared to the previous annual rent of 8629 million on the same units representing a rent recapture rate of 1034 on the units released we released 13 units to new clients without a period of vacancy and 33 units to new clients after a period of vacancy 

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide rent concessions to our clients we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or rent concessions to our clients to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

at december 31 2021 our average annualized contractual rent was approximately 1403 per square foot on the 10972 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2021 we classified 33 properties with a carrying amount of 305 million as real estate and lease intangibles held for sale net on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial

results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

investments in existing properties 

during 2021 we capitalized costs of 219 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 63 million for releasing costs 978000 for recurring capital expenditures and 146 million for nonrecurring building improvements in comparison during 2020 we capitalized costs of 70 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 18 million for releasing costs 198000 for recurring capital expenditures and 50 million for nonrecurring building improvements 

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market credit worthiness of our clients the lease term and the willingness of our clients to pay higher rental revenue over the terms of the leases 

we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and recurring landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements in which we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties 

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 53year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2021 and once during 2022 as of february 2022 we have paid 97 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 114 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 



the dividends paid per share during 2021 totaled 2833 as compared to 2794 during 2020 an increase of 0039 or 14 in november 2021 we also made a 2060 tax distribution of orion shares that occurred in conjunction with the orion divestiture on november 12 2021 after our merger with vereit on november 1 2021 the fair market value of these shares for tax distribution was determined to be 206272 per share which was calculated using the five day volume weighted average share price after issuance 

the monthly dividend of 02465 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2958 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 41 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 7159 on december 31 2021 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when acquiring a property for investment purposes we typically allocate the cost of real estate acquired inclusive of transaction costs to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their relative estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value and the value of inplace leases as applicable additionally above–market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as financing receivables amortizing over the lease term while below–market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as prepaid rent in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value of the land building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities and is often based upon the various characteristics of the market where the property is located in addition any assumed mortgages are recorded at their estimated fair values the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors such as industry type client investment grade maturity date and comparable borrowings for similar assets the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property a fair value analysis is performed and to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the current book value a provision for impairment is recorded to reduce the book value to estimated fair value key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

when assessing the collectability of future lease payments one of the key factors we have considered during 2020 and 2021 has been the covid19 pandemic we generally assess collectability based on an analysis of creditworthiness economic trends and other facts and circumstances related to our applicable clients if the collection of substantially all of the future lease payments is less than probable we will writeoff the receivable balances associated with the lease and cease to recognize lease income including straightline rent unless cash is received when due unless otherwise specified references to reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue include amounts reserved for in the current period as well as unrecognized contractual rental revenue and unrecognized straightline rental revenue for leases accounted for on a cash basis during 2021 we have entered into rent deferral agreements with certain clients allowing them to pay rent to us over an extended time period for covidrelated receivables additionally gradual improvements in certain clients financial positions have allowed us to reassess and potentially change this cash basis accounting for outstanding receivables references to reserve reversals recorded as increases to rental revenue include amounts where the accounting for recognition of rental revenue and straightline rental revenue has been moved from the cash to the accrual basis as of december 31 2021 other than the information related to the reserves we have recorded to such date we do not have any further client specific information that would change our assessment that collection of substantially all of the future lease payments under our existing leases is probable however there may be impacts in future periods that could change this assessment as the situation continues to evolve and as more information becomes available 

the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread are negatively impacting the economy across many industries including the industries in which some of our clients operate these impacts may continue and increase in severity as the duration or extent of the pandemic increases which may in turn adversely impact the fair value estimates of our real estate and require the recording of impairments on our properties as a result we evaluated certain key assumptions involving fair value estimates of our real estate recording of impairments on our properties and collectability of our accounts receivable for our clients due to more positive trends we did not have to record any provisions for impairment on our theater properties during 2021 however we continue to evaluate the

total revenue 

the following summarizes our total revenue in thousands 



rental revenue excluding reimbursable 

the table below summarizes the increase in rental revenue excluding reimbursable in 2021 compared to 2020 dollars in thousands 



1 excludes 5869364 square feet from properties ground leased to clients and 2100990 square feet from properties with no land or building ownership 

2 for purposes of comparability same store rental revenue is presented on a constant currency basis using the exchange rate as of december 31 2021 of 135 gbpusd none of the properties in spain met our same store pool definition for the periods presented in addition the same store pool excludes properties assumed on november 1 2021 as a result of our merger with vereit 

3 relates to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 128 properties comprising 2292635 square feet that were available for lease during part of 2021 or 2020 ii rental revenue for properties nine properties comprising 357605 square feet under development and iii rental revenue that is not contractual base rent such as lease termination settlements 

the table below summarizes the increase in rental revenue excluding reimbursable in 2020 compared to 2019 dollars in thousands 



table of contents 

1 relates to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 174 properties comprising 2973551 square feet that were available for lease during part of 2020 or 2019 ii rental revenue for properties six properties comprising 943004 square feet under development and iii lease termination settlements 

for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were vacant at any time ii were under development or redevelopment or iii were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

our calculation of same store rental revenue includes rent deferred for future payment as a result of lease concessions we granted in response to the covid19 pandemic and recognized under the practical expedient provided by the financial accounting standards board fasb same store rental revenue in 2021 was negatively impacted by net reserves recorded as reductions of rental revenue of 66 million compared to 329 million in 2020 same store rental revenue in 2020 was negatively impacted by net reserves recorded as reductions of rental revenue of 399 million compared to 14 million in 2019 our calculation of same store rental revenue also includes uncollected rent for which we have not granted a lease concession if these applicable amounts of rent deferrals and uncollected rent were excluded from our calculation of same store rental revenue the increase for 2021 relative to 2020 would have been 77 

rental revenue was negatively impacted by rent reserves during 2021 and 2020 primarily due to the covid19 pandemic particularly with respect to the ongoing disruption to the theater industry as the covid19 pandemic did not affect our rent collections until april 2020 there was no related impact for the three months ended march 31 2020 the following table summarizes reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue in millions 



of the 11136 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2021 11043 or 992 are singleclient properties and the remaining are multiclient properties of the 11043 singleclient properties 10883 or 986 were net leased at december 31 2021 

of the 11236 inplace leases in the portfolio which excludes 208 vacant units 9639 or 858 were under leases that provide for increases in rental revenue through 

• base rent increases tied to inflation typically subject to ceilings 

• percentage rent based on a percentage of the clients’ gross sales 

• fixed increases or 

• a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 65 million in 2021 51 million in 2020 and 80 million in 2019 percentage rent in 2021 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2022 

  at december 31 2021 our portfolio of 11136 properties was 985 leased with 164 properties available for lease as compared to 979 leased with 140 properties available for lease at december 31 2020 it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease or sale could increase in the future given the nature of economic cycles and other unforeseen global events such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread 

rental revenue reimbursable 

a number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses the increase in contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients in the periods presented is primarily due to the growth of our portfolio due to acquisitions 

table of contents 

other revenue 

other revenue primarily relates to interest income recognized on financing receivables for certain leases with abovemarket terms the increases in 2021 and 2020 are due to additional leases with abovemarket terms which is proportional to overall portfolio growth 

total expenses 

the following summarizes our total expenses dollars in thousands 



1 in 2021 we began presenting income taxes which was previously presented in expenses below a newly captioned subtotal for income before income taxes within our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

2 general and administrative expenses for 2020 included an executive severance charge related to the departure of our former chief financial officer cfo in march 2020 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 35 million and was recorded to general and administrative expense in order to present a normalized calculation of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue for 2020 we have excluded this executive severance charge to arrive at a normalized general and administrative amount of 698 million which was used for our calculation 

3 excludes rental revenue reimbursable total revenue for 2020 and 2019 was updated to reflect the reclassification of certain miscellaneous nonrecurring revenue from other revenue to other income net in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

depreciation and amortization 

the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2021 and 2020 which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders normalized ffo and “adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo normalized ffo and affo

interest expense 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 



the increase in interest expense from 2020 to 2021 is primarily due to the issuance of 465 billion of notes associated with the exchange offer in conjunction with our merger with vereit in november 2021 the issuance of senior unsecured notes during 2020 and 2021 outside of our merger with vereit which included aggregate totals of 168 billion in principal of usd denominated notes and £115 billion in principal of sterling denominated notes partially offset by the early redemptions during 2021 and 2020 of 12 billion of notes increases in amortization of net note and mortgage premiums and lower average balances on our credit facility and commercial paper borrowings 

the increase in interest expense from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to the october 2020 issuance of our 1625 notes due 2030 may and july 2020 issuances of our 2031 notes the may 2019 issuance of our 2730 notes due 2034 the june 2019 issuance of our 3250 notes due 2029 and higher interest related to mortgages assumed during december 2019 partially offset by the january 2020 repayment of our 5750 notes due january 2021 the june 2020 repayment of one of our 2500 million term loans and lower average interest rates 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the weighted average interest rate on our 

• revolving credit facility outstanding borrowings of 6500 million was 09 

• commercial paper outstanding borrowings of 9014 million was 02 

• term loan outstanding of 2500 million excluding deferred financing costs of 443000 was swapped to fixed at 39 

• mortgages payable of 111 billion excluding net premiums totaling 287 million and deferred financing costs of 790000 on these mortgages was 47 and 

• notes and bonds payable of 1226 billion excluding unamortized net premiums of 2955 million and deferred financing costs of 531 million was 33 

property expenses excluding reimbursable 

property expenses excluding reimbursable consist of costs associated with properties available for lease nonnet leased properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to properties available for lease and nonnet leased properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2021 164 properties were available for lease or sale as compared to 140 at december 31 2020 and 94 at december 31 2019 

the increase in property expenses excluding reimbursable in 2021 is primarily due to the increase in portfolio size resulting in higher utilities repairs and maintenance propertyrelated legal expenses property taxes and reserves for contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients the increase in property expenses in 2020 relative to 2019 is primarily due to reserves for contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients an increase in repairs and maintenance expense and an increase in portfolio size and the number of vacant properties at yearend 

table of contents 

property expenses reimbursable 

the increase in property expenses reimbursable in both 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to our increased portfolio size which contributed to higher operating expenses as a result of our acquisitions in 2021 and 2020 and an increase in property taxes paid on behalf of our clients 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses are expenditures related to the operations of our company including employeerelated costs professional fees and other general overhead costs associated with running our business 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for 2021 is primarily due to higher payrollrelated costs and higher corporatelevel professional fees the increase in general and administrative expenses for 2020 was primarily due to a severance charge of 35 million for our former cfo who departed the company in march 2020 higher payrollrelated costs and higher corporate–level professional fees partially offset by lower costs for terminated acquisitions and travel 

provisions for impairment 

the following table summarizes provisions for impairment during the periods indicated below dollars in millions 



during 2020 we identified the impact of the covid19 pandemic as an impairment triggering event for properties occupied by certain of our clients experiencing difficulties meeting their lease obligations to us after considering the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on the key assumptions we determined that the carrying values of 38 properties classified as held for investment for the year ended december 31 2020 were not recoverable as a result we recorded provisions for impairment of 1050 million for the year ended december 31 2020 on the applicable properties impacted by the covid19 pandemic of the provisions for impairment recorded during 2020 for properties impacted by the covid19 pandemic a total of 13 assets occupied by certain of our clients in the theater industry were impaired for 838 million which reduced the carrying value of the properties from 1234 million to their estimated fair value of 396 million impairments recorded on other properties during the year ended december 31 2020 totaled 422 million 

merger and integrationrelated costs 

in conjunction with our merger with vereit and orion divestiture we incurred approximately 1674 million of merger and integrationrelated transaction costs during 2021 the merger and integrationrelated costs incurred to date primarily consist of advisory fees attorney fees accountant fees sec filing fees and additional integration costs that include incremental and nonrecurring costs necessary to convert data and systems retain employees and otherwise enable us to operate the acquired vereit assets efficiently there were no merger and integrationrelated costs during 2020 or 2019

foreign currency and derivative gains net 

we borrow in the functional currencies of the countries in which we invest foreign currency and derivative gains net are primarily a result of intercompany debt with certain remeasurement transactions and marktomarket adjustments on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in december 2021 we completed the early redemption on all 7500 million in principal amount of outstanding 4650 notes due august 2023 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a 464 million loss on extinguishment of debt during 2021 

in october 2021 we completed the early redemption on 96 million in principal of a mortgage due june 2022 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a loss of 315000 on extinguishment of debt for 2021 

in september 2021 we completed the early redemption on 125 million in principal of a mortgage due june 2032 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a 40 million loss on extinguishment of debt during 2021 

in january 2021 we completed the early redemption on all 9500 million in principal amount of outstanding 3250 notes due october 2022 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a 465 million loss on extinguishment of debt during 2021 

in january 2020 we completed the early redemption on all 2500 million in principal amount of outstanding 5750 notes due january 2021 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a 98 million loss on extinguishment of debt during 2020 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities for 2021 relates to three equity method investments that were acquired in our merger with vereit there were no comparative investments during 2020 or 2019 

other income net 

beginning in 2021 certain miscellaneous nonrecurring revenue has been reclassified from total revenue to other income net in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income  interest income from our money market accounts was higher for 2020 as compared to 2019 which is primarily due to higher average investment balances 

income taxes 

income taxes are for city and state income and franchise taxes and for international income taxes accrued or paid by us and our subsidiaries the increase in income taxes for 2021 and 2020 was primarily attributable to our increased volume of uk investments which contributed to higher uk income taxes for both years

net income available to common stockholders 

the following summarizes our net income available to common stockholders dollars in millions except per share data 



1 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes provisions for impairment gains from the sale of properties and foreign currency gains and losses which can vary from period to period based on timing and significantly impact net income available to the company and available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders in 2021 was primarily impacted by the following transactions i a 972 million loss on extinguishment of debt which primarily includes 465 million related to the january 2021 early redemption of the 3250 notes due october 2022 recorded in the three months ended march 31 2021 and 464 million related to the december 2021 early redemption of the 4650 notes due august 2023 recorded in the three months ended december 31 2021 ii 1674 million of merger and integrationrelated costs related to our merger with vereit and spinoff of office properties to orion office reit inc iii 390 million of provisions for impairment and iv 147 million in net reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue net income available to common stockholders in 2020 was primarily impacted by the following transactions i 1472 million of provisions for impairment ii 525 million in net reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue iii a 98 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to the january 2020 early redemption of the 5750 notes due january 2021 and iv a 35 million executive severance charge for our former cfo for 2019 the only comparable charges were 402 million in provisions for impairment and 29 million in reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue 

adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate adjusted ebitda re  

the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit came to the conclusion that a nareitdefined ebitda metric for real estate companies ie ebitda for real estate or ebitda re  would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among reits our definition of “adjusted ebitda re ” is generally consistent with the nareit definition other than our adjustments to remove foreign currency and derivative gains and losses and executive severance charges which is consistent with our previous calculations of adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda re  a non–gaap financial measure for the most recent quarter as earnings net income before i interest expense including noncash loss gain on swaps ii income and franchise taxes iii loss on extinguishment of debt iv real estate depreciation and amortization v provisions for impairment vi merger and integrationrelated costs vii gain on sales of real estate viii foreign currency and derivative gains and losses net as described in the adjusted funds from operations section and ix our proportionate share of interest expense and real estate depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated entities our adjusted ebitda re may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda re reported by other companies or as defined by nareit and other companies may interpret or define adjusted ebitda re differently than we do management believes adjusted ebitda re to be a meaningful measure of a reit’s performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts lenders and investors management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly adjusted ebitda re metric which we refer to as annualized adjusted ebitda re  is meaningful because it represents the company’s current earnings run rate for the period presented annualized adjusted ebitda re and annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re  as defined below are also used to determine the vesting of performance share awards granted to executive officers annualized adjusted ebitda re should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance we define annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re as annualized adjusted ebitda re  subject to certain adjustments to incorporate operating income from properties we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and to remove operating income from properties we disposed of during the applicable quarter giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period we believe annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re is a useful nongaap supplemental measure as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter our ratios of net debttoannualized adjusted ebitda re and net debttoannualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re  which are used by management as a measure of leverage are calculated as net debt which we define as total debt per our consolidated balance sheet

excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts but including our proportionate share on debt from unconsolidated entities less cash and cash equivalents divided by annualized quarterly adjusted ebitda re and annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re  respectively 

the following table summarizes our annualized adjusted ebitda re and annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re calculations for the periods indicated below dollars in thousands 



  

1 net income for the three months ended december 31 2021 was negatively impacted by 827000 of rent reserves recorded as reductions of rental revenue of which 56 million was related to straightline rent receivables net of reserve reversals of 48 million net income for the three months ended december 31 2020 was negatively impacted by 181 million of rent reserves recorded as reductions of rental revenue of which 33 million relates to straightline rent 

2 we calculate annualized adjusted ebitda re by multiplying the quarterly adjusted ebitda re by four 

3 net debt is total debt per our consolidated balance sheet excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts but including our proportionate share on debt from unconsolidated entities less cash and cash equivalents 

4 net debtannualized adjusted ebitda re was 60x for the three months ended december 31 2021 54x for the three months ended december 31 2020 and 55x for the three months ended december 31 2019 

5 during 2021 net debt was adjusted to exclude deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts under the prior calculation of net debt which included deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts net debtadjusted ebitda re was 53x for the three months ended december 31 2020 and net debtpro forma adjusted ebitda re was 52x for the three months ended december 31 2020 the adjustment of net debt did not impact the calculations for the three months ended december 31 2019 which were 55x for net debtadjusted ebitda re and 52x for net debtpro forma adjusted ebitda re  

the annualized pro forma adjustments consist of adjustments to incorporate operating income from properties we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and to remove operating income from properties we disposed of during the applicable quarter giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for the three months ended december 31 2021 the annualized pro forma adjustments are inclusive of the effects of the merger the annualized pro forma adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes and bonds the following table summarizes our annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re calculation for the periods indicated below

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders normalized ffo 

the following summarizes our ffo and normalized ffo dollars in millions except per share data 

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trusts definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus provisions for impairments of depreciable real estate assets and reduced by gains on property sales we define normalized ffo a nongaap financial measure as ffo excluding merger and integrationrelated costs related to our merger with vereit 



1 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

ffo and normalized ffo for 2021 2020 and 2019 were primarily impacted by the same transactions listed under net income available to common stockholders on page 59 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and normalized ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share in thousands except per share amounts 

table of contents 



we consider ffo and normalized ffo to be appropriate supplemental measures of a reit’s operating performance as they are based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo and adds back merger and integrationrelated costs for normalized ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative 

table of contents 

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

the following summarizes our affo dollars in millions except per share data 

we define affo a nongaap measure as ffo adjusted for unique revenue and expense items which we believe are not as pertinent to the measurement of our ongoing operating performance 



1 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

affo during 2021 and 2020 was primarily impacted by reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue related to the covid19 pandemic during the second half of 2021 reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue were partially offset by reserve reversals recorded as an increase to rental revenue where the accounting for recognition of rental revenue and straightline rental revenue has been moved from the cash to the accrual basis 

we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term “cad” for cash available for distribution “fad” for funds available for distribution or other terms our affo calculations may not be comparable to affo cad or fad reported by other companies and other companies may interpret or define such terms differently than we do 

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to normalized ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share in thousands except per share amounts

1 as of december 31 2021 there was 587 million of uncollected rent deferred as a result of lease concessions we granted in response to the covid19 pandemic and recognized under the practical expedient provided by the fasb and 413 million of uncollected rent for which we have not granted a lease concession 

2 see reconciling items for normalized ffo presented under “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders normalized ffo 

3 the executive severance charge represents the incremental costs incurred upon our former cfos departure in march 2020 consisting of 16 million of cash 18 million of sharebased compensation expense and 58000 of professional fees 

4 includes the amortization of premiums and discounts on notes payable and assumption of our mortgages payable which are being amortized over the life of the applicable debt and costs incurred and capitalized upon issuance and exchange of our notes payable assumption of our mortgages payable and issuance of our term loans which are also being amortized over the lives of the applicable debt no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

5 straightline payments from crosscurrency swaps represent quarterly payments in us dollars received by us from counterparties in exchange for associated foreign currency payments these usd payments are fixed and determinable for the duration of the associated hedging transaction 

6 includes adjustments allocable to noncontrolling interests obligations related to financing lease liabilities marktomarket adjustments on investments and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and foreign currency gains and losses as a result of intercompany debt and remeasurement transactions 

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

table of contents 

presentation of the information regarding ffo normalized ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo normalized ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo normalized ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo normalized ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo normalized ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity our ability to make cash distributions or our ability to pay interest payments 

impact of inflation 

leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases increases in the consumer price index or retail price index in the case of certain leases in the uk typically subject to ceilings or increases in the clients’ sales volumes we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

moreover our use of net lease agreements tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the client is responsible for property expenses inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to economic risks from interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates a portion of these risks is hedged but the risks may affect our financial statements 

interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and commercial paper program term loan mortgages payable and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps interest rate locks and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents 

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2021 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  expected maturity data 



1 excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable net premiums recorded on notes payable and deferred financing costs on mortgages payable notes payable and our term loan at december 31 2021 the unamortized balance of net premiums on mortgages payable is 287 million the unamortized balance of net premiums on notes payable is 2955 million and the balance of deferred financing costs on mortgages payable is 790000 on notes payable is 531 million and on our term loan is 443000 

2 we base the estimated fair value of the publiclytraded fixed rate senior notes and bonds at december 31 2021 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate mortgages and private senior notes payable at december 31 2021 on the relevant forward interest rate curve plus an applicable creditadjusted spread we believe that the carrying values of the line of credit borrowings commercial paper borrowings and term loan balance reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at december 31 2021 

the table above incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2021 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

at december 31 2021 our outstanding notes bonds and mortgages payable had fixed interest rates interest on our revolving credit facility commercial paper borrowings and term loan balance is variable however the variable interest rate feature on our term loan has been mitigated by an interest rate swap agreement based on our revolving credit facility balance of 6500 million at december 31 2021 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest rate costs by 65 million per year 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge we continuously evaluate and manage our foreign currency risk through the use of derivative financial instruments including crosscurrency swaps currency exchange swaps foreign currency collars and foreign currency forward contracts with financial counterparties where practicable such derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes

changes in internal controls 

as a result of our merger with vereit in november 2021 we are operating two separate enterprise resource planning erp systems to generate our financial statements in 2022 we plan to integrate these two erp platforms into one primary system we have updated our internal controls over financial reporting as necessary to accommodate modifications to our business processes for these parallel erp systems as we work towards enhanced automated controls through a central platform except as described above there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

recent developments 

theater industry update 

as of december 31 2020 our clients in the theater industry represented 56 of our annualized contractual rent given the ongoing disruption to this industry due to the covid19 pandemic we performed a propertylevel analysis on the collectability of rent for our theater properties our analysis involved the assignment of quartile rankings for each asset’s prepandemic ebitdar relative to each operator’s overall footprint other criteria utilized included an analysis of the property’s prepandemic annual ebitda generation before corporate overhead and real estate fundamentals 

as a result of this analysis at september 30 2020 we determined that for 31 of our 78 theater properties it was no longer probable that we would collect substantially all of contractual rents due we fully reserved for six additional theater properties for which we do not possess unit level financial information consequently we reserved for 100 of the outstanding receivables for 37 theater properties at september 30 2020 beginning october 2020 contractual rent from these 37 properties is accounted for on a cash basis additionally during november 2020 one of these properties was sold we fully reserved for one additional theater property at december 31 2020 at december 31 2020 the receivables outstanding for our 77 theater properties totaled 486 million net of 237 million of reserves and includes 78 million of straightline rent receivables net of 18 million of reserves the monthly contractual rent associated with the 37 properties accounted for under the cash basis totaled approximately 28 million at december 31 2020 the following table summarizes reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue for theater properties dollars in millions 



additionally during the third quarter we recorded provisions for impairment on 12 of the 37 theater properties for 790 million during the fourth quarter we recorded provisions for impairment on one additional theater property for 48 million impairment charges are not included in nareitdefined funds from operations ffo available to commons stockholders or in our calculation of adjusted funds from operations affo available to commons stockholders

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 52year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2020 and once during 2021 as of february 2021 we have paid 93 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 109 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 



  

the dividends paid per share during 2020 totaled 27940 as compared to 27105 during 2019 an increase of 00835 or 31 

  

the monthly dividend of 02345 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 281 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 45 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the 

table of contents 

nyse of 6217 on december 31 2020 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

acquisitions during 2020 

below is a listing of our acquisitions in the us and uk for the year ended december 31 2020 



1 the initial average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that our client could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above contractual net operating income for the fourth quarter of 2020 includes approximately 700000 received as a settlement credit for a property acquired in the us as reimbursement of a free rent period 

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the initial average cash lease yield is computed as follows estimated cash net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs 

2 none of our investments during 2020 caused any one client to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2020 all of our investments in acquired properties during 2020 are 100 leased at the acquisition date 

3 represents investments of £7078 million sterling during the year ended december 31 2020 converted at the applicable exchange rate on the date of acquisition 

4 our clients occupying the new properties operate in 26 industries and are 866 retail and 134 industrial based on rental revenue approximately 61 of the rental revenue generated from acquisitions during 2020 is from our investment grade rated clients which we define as clients with a credit rating and clients that are subsidiaries or affiliates of companies with a credit rating as of the balance sheet date of baa3bbb or higher from one of the three major rating agencies moody’sspfitch 

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2020 we had 140 properties available for lease out of 6592 properties in our portfolio which represents a 979 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio 

the following tables summarize our leasing results for the periods indicated below 



1 includes scheduled and unscheduled expirations including leases rejected in bankruptcy as well as future expirations resolved in the current quarter 

2 the annual new rent on these releases was 2101 million as compared to the previous annual rent of 2095 million on the same properties representing a rent recapture rate of 1003 on the properties released during the three months ended december 31 2020 

3 released all five properties to new clients after a period of vacancy 

table of contents 



1 includes scheduled and unscheduled expirations including leases rejected in bankruptcy as well as future expirations resolved in the current year 

2 the annual new rent on these releases was 6624 million as compared to the previous annual rent of 6626 million on the same properties representing a rent recapture rate of 1000 on the properties released during the year ended december 31 2020 

3 released five properties to new clients without a period of vacancy and 13 properties to new clients after a period of vacancy 

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide rent concessions to our clients we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or rent concessions to our clients to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

at december 31 2020 our average annualized contractual rent was approximately 1538 per square foot on the 6452 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2020 we classified 21 properties with a carrying amount of 190 million as real estate and lease intangibles held for sale net on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

investments in existing properties 

during 2020 we capitalized costs of 70 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 18 million for releasing costs 198000 for recurring capital expenditures and 50 million for nonrecurring building improvements in comparison during 2019 we capitalized costs of 179 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 21 million for releasing costs 801000 for recurring capital expenditures and 150 million for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market credit worthiness of our clients the lease term and the willingness of our clients to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and recurring landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements in which we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties

impact of covid19 

the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread are negatively impacting global national and regional economies across many industries including the industries in which some of our clients operate and have disrupted the businesses and operations of some of our clients each of which has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these impacts may increase in severity as the duration or extent of the pandemic increases see item 1a—risk factors in part i of this report for more information regarding some of the actual and potential future impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread on our clients and our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

as a result of this challenging environment we continue to work diligently with our clients most affected by the pandemic to understand their business operations and financial liquidity and their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations to us as we carefully navigate this difficult economic period with our clients our focus is on finding resolutions that preserve the longterm relationships we have built with many of our clients 

the majority of lease concessions granted to our clients during 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic have been rent deferrals with the original lease term unchanged in these cases we have determined that the collection of deferred rent is probable within the meaning applicable under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap although we cannot assure you that this determination will not change in the future in addition as we believe to be the case with many retail landlords we have received many shortterm rent relief requests most often in the form of rent deferral requests or requests for further discussion from our clients we believe that not all of our client requests will ultimately result in lease modification agreements nor have we relinquished our contractual rights under our lease agreements where rent concessions have not yet been granted our rent collections for the periods below and rent relief requests todate may not be indicative of collections concessions or requests in any future period 

percentages of contractual rent collected as of january 31 2021 



1 collection rates are calculated as the aggregate contractual rent collected for the applicable period from the beginning of that applicable period through january 31 2021 divided by the contractual rent charged for the applicable period rent collection percentages are calculated based on contractual rents excluding percentage rents and contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients charged amounts have not been adjusted for any covid19 related rent relief granted and include contractual rents from any clients in bankruptcy due to differences in applicable foreign currency conversion rates and rent conventions the percentages above may differ from percentages calculated utilizing total our portfolio annualized contractual rent 

2 we define our top 20 clients as our 20 largest clients based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent as of december 31 2020 for all periods 

table of contents 

3 we define our investment grade clients as clients with a credit rating and clients that are subsidiaries or affiliates of companies with a credit rating as of the balance sheet date of baa3bbb or higher from one of the three major rating agencies moody’sspfitch 

the following table provides information relating to percentage of total contractual rent due and collected for the indicated periods  



 less than 01 

1 collection rates are calculated as the aggregate contractual rent collected for the applicable period from the beginning of that applicable period through january 31 2021 divided by the contractual rent charged for the applicable period rent collection percentages are calculated based on contractual rents excluding percentage rents and contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients charged amounts have not been adjusted for any covid19 related rent relief granted and include contractual rents from any clients in bankruptcy due to differences in applicable foreign currency conversion rates and rent conventions the industry percentages above may differ from industry percentages calculated utilizing our total portfolio annualized contractual rent 

table of contents 

as the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread continue to evolve the ability of our clients to continue to pay rent to us may further diminish and therefore we cannot assure you that our historical rental collections are indicative of our rental collections in the future as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread our revenues in the foreseeable future may decline relative to 2020 and that decline may continue or increase in subsequent periods as long as such impacts continue to exist 

summarized financial results 

the following summarizes our select financial results dollars in millions except per share data 



1 the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes provisions for impairment gain from the sales of real estate and foreign currency gains and losses these items can vary from year to year and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders and period to period comparisons 

2 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

our financial results for 2020 were impacted by the following transactions i 1472 million of provisions for impairment ii 525 million in reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue iii a 98 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to the early redemption of the 5750 notes due 2021 and iv a 35 million executive severance charge for our former cfo for 2019 the only comparable charges were 402 million in provisions for impairment and 29 million in reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue 

see our discussion of ffo and affo which are not financial measures under gaap later in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and affo 

  

dividend policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock 

  

distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of realty income lp each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders 

in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2020 our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 9642 million or approximately 1198 of our estimated taxable income of 8049 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our cash distributions to common stockholders in 2020 totaled 9642 million representing 822 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 1173 billion in comparison our 2019 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 8521 million representing 812 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 105 billion 

  

table of contents 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year however noncorporate stockholders including individuals generally may deduct up to 20 of dividends from a reit other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 

  

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 176 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2020 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes 

business philosophy and strategy 

  

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income a net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on 1 fixed increases 2 increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings or 3 additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm net lease agreements with our commercial clients generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy we believe that diversification of the portfolio by client industry geography and property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio that as of december 31 2020 consisted of 6592 properties doing business in 51 industries and located in 49 us states puerto rico and the uk none of the 51 industries represented in our property portfolio accounted for more than 119 of our annualized contractual rent as of december 31 2020 

  

investment strategy 

when identifying new properties for investment we generally focus on acquiring highquality real estate that our clients consider important to the successful operation of their business we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

  

• properties that are freestanding commerciallyzoned with a single client 

• properties that are in significant markets or strategic locations critical to generating revenue for our clients ie they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business 

• properties that we deem to be profitable for our clients andor can generally be characterized as important to the successful operations of the company’s business 

• properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our clients 

• properties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs 

• properties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents for similar properties and 

table of contents 

• properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution o r assumption of longterm net lease agreements offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases 

  

we seek to invest in properties owned or leased by clients that are already or could become leaders in their respective businesses supported by mechanisms including but not limited to occupancy of prime real estate locations pricing merchandise assortment service quality economies of scale consumer branding ecommerce and advertising in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of singleclient properties net leased to different clients operating in a variety of industries we have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities often using our relationships with various clients ownersdevelopers brokers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions we also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations clients and industries for investment this research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value 

  

in selecting potential investments we generally look for clients with one or more of the following attributes 

  

• reliable and sustainable cash flow 

• revenue and cash flow from multiple sources 

• are willing to sign a longterm lease 10 or more years and 

• are large owners andor users of real estate 

  

from a retail perspective our investment strategy is to target clients that have a service nondiscretionary andor lowpricepoint component to their business we believe these characteristics better position clients to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers as a result of the execution of this strategy approximately 95 of our annualized retail contractual rent at december 31 2020 is derived from our clients with a service nondiscretionary andor low price point component to their business from a nonretail perspective we target industrial properties generally leased to industry leaders that are primarily investment grade rated companies we believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties 

after applying this investment strategy we pursue those transactions that meet our strategic objectives which include achieving an attractive aggregate investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable riskadjusted returns we will continue to evaluate all investments consistent with our objective of owning net lease assets 

  

underwriting strategy 

in order to be considered for acquisition properties must meet stringent underwriting requirements we have established a fourpart analysis to examine each potential investment based on 

  

• the aforementioned overall real estate characteristics including demographics replacement cost and comparative rental rates 

• industry client including credit profile and market conditions 

• store profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available and 

• the importance of the real estate location to the operations of our clients’ business 

we believe the principal financial obligations for most of our clients typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to employees suppliers and real estate lease obligations be cause we typically own the land and building in which a client conducts its business or which are critical to the client’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a client’s lease obligation is less than the client’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that clients must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive therefore in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property 

  

thus as the property owner we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same client in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by our client during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new client or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of our clients’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition 

  

we conduct comprehensive reviews of the business segments and industries in which our clients’ operate prior to entering into any transaction our research department conducts a review of a client’s credit quality the information 

table of contents 

reviewed may include reports and filings including any public credit ratings financial statements debt and equity analyst reports and reviews of corporate credit spreads stock prices market capitalization and other financial metrics we conduct additional due diligence including financial reviews of the client and continue to monitor our clients’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed and providing summaries of these findings to management 

at december 31 2020 approximately 51 of our annualized contractual rent comes from properties leased to our investment grade clients their subsidiaries or affiliated companies at december 31 2020 our top 20 clients based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent represented approximately 52 of our annualized rent and 12 of these clients have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries or affiliates of investment grade companies 

  

asset management strategy 

in addition to pursuing new properties for investment we seek to increase earnings and dividends through active asset management 

  

generally our asset management efforts seek to achieve 

  

• rent increases at the expiration of existing leases when market conditions permit 

• optimum exposure to certain clients industries and markets through releasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties 

• maximum assetlevel returns on properties that are released or sold 

• additional value creation from the existing portfolio by enhancing individual properties pursuing alternative uses and deriving ancillary revenue and 

• investment opportunities in new asset classes for the portfolio 

  

we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our clients our clients’ industries and the real estate locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality our active asset management strategy pursues asset sales when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

• generate higher returns 

• enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

• extend our average remaining lease term andor 

• strategically decrease client industry or geographic concentration 

  

the active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy of maintaining high occupancy 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility commercial paper program or debt securities however there can be no assurances that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowings on our credit facility and under our commercial paper program and through public securities offerings 

we may choose to mitigate our financial exposure to exchange rate risk for properties acquired outside the us through the issuance of debt securities denominated in the same local currency and through currency derivatives we may leave a portion of our foreign cash flow unhedged to reinvest in additional properties in the same local currency 

table of contents 

for 2021 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio we plan to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during 2021 or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2020 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loan and mortgages payable were 885 billion or approximately 282 of our total market capitalization of 3134 billion 

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2020 as the sum of 

  

• shares of our common stock outstanding of 361303445 plus total common units outstanding of 463119 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 6217 per share on december 31 2020 or 2249 billion 

• outstanding mortgages payable of 2996 million excluding net mortgage premiums of 17 million and deferred financing costs of 973000 

• outstanding borrowings of 2500 million on our term loan excluding deferred financing costs of 642000

this “risk factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders” unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of outstanding preferred stock while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of outstanding preferred stock 

risks related to our business and industry 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

in late 2019 covid19 was first reported in wuhan china and on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic the outbreak has spread globally and has led governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states and elsewhere to impose measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders 

the covid19 pandemic has had and other pandemics in the future could have repercussions across global economies and financial markets the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread have adversely impacted regional national and global economic activity and have contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets the impact of the covid19 pandemic has been rapidly evolving and as cases of covid19 have continued to increase and be identified many countries including the united states and united kingdom have reacted by among other things instituting quarantines and restricting travel many national state and local governments including in areas where we own properties have also reacted by instituting quarantines restrictions on travel shelterinplace orders restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate school closures limitations on attendance at events or other gatherings and social distancing requirements and additional national state and local governments may implement similar restrictions in that regard surges in covid19 cases have led many state and local governments to increase the scope and severity of some of these restrictions and to institute new restrictions 

as a result the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread are negatively impacting the global national and regional economies generally and many industries directly or indirectly and those impacts are likely to continue and may increase in severity including potentially triggering a prolonged period of negative or limited economic growth factors that have contributed or may contribute to the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread on the business results of operations financial condition and liquidity of us and our clients include without limitation the following 

• a complete or partial closure of or other operational limitations or issues at properties operated by our clients resulting from government action including travel bans border closings business closures quarantine shelterinplace or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes or client action 

• reduced economic activity the deterioration in our or our clients’ ability to operate in affected areas and any delays in the supply of products or services to our clients may impact certain of our clients’ businesses results of operations financial condition and liquidity and may cause certain of our clients to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full or at all and to seek whether through negotiation restructuring or bankruptcy reductions or deferrals in their rent payments and other obligations to us or early termination of their leases 

• we may experience difficulties some of which may be related to unexpected supply chain disruptions in leasing selling or redeveloping vacant properties or renewing expiring or terminated leases on terms we consider acceptable or at all 

• we may experience difficulty accessing the bank lending capital markets and other financial markets on attractive terms or at all and a severe disruption or instability in the national or global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions may adversely affect our cost of capital our access to capital to acquire additional properties necessary to grow our business and to fund our business operations our ability to pay dividends on our common stock our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness and our other liabilities on a timely basis and our clients’ ability to fund their business operations and meet their obligations to us and others 

• the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic could negatively impact our credit ratings the interest rates on our borrowings and if the covid19 pandemic continues for an extended period of time our future compliance with financial covenants under our credit facility and other debt instruments which could result in a default and 

table of contents 

potentially an acceleration of indebtedness any of which could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility to sell commercial paper notes under our commercial paper program or incur other indebtedness and pay dividends on our common stock and to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness and our other obligations when due 

• the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the market value of our properties has led to impairment charges and may require that we incur further impairment charges asset writedowns or similar charges 

• the impact on the ability of our employees including members of our management team or board of directors to fulfill their duties to us as a result of the covid19 pandemic either as a result of measures taken to limit its spread or as a result of infection and 

• a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability to grow our portfolio of properties 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and those of our clients will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the scope severity and duration of the pandemic the actions taken to contain the pandemic or limit its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures to date the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact among other things the ability of a number of our clients’ to generate adequate or in certain cases any revenue from their businesses the ability or willingness of many of our clients to pay rent in full or at all or on a timely basis and our ability to collect rent from our clients it may also adversely impact our ability to enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent our occupancy levels our ability to acquire properties or complete construction projects and may otherwise negatively affect our business 

certain industries in which our clients operate appear to have been disproportionately adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its spread these adverse impacts have reduced the amount of rent we have been able to collect from our clients in those industries and may further decrease the likelihood of us collecting such rent in the future for example in october 2020 two major theater operators that are clients of ours publicly announced financial difficulties from the covid19 pandemic including sustained operating losses the depletion of liquidity resources and the closure of locations in response to this information we have recorded reserves as a reduction of rental revenue on certain theater leases related to those clients on an accrual basis and have recorded provisions for impairment on certain of our assets with respect to properties of which those theater operators are clients to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value our ability to collect rent from these clients from other clients in the theater industry or from other clients who face similar hardships may be further adversely impacted as the covid19 pandemic and its adverse impacts on those clients continue in addition if any of these or other clients declare bankruptcy or enter into similar corporate restructuring arrangements they may seek to reject or renegotiate our existing leases which could adversely affect our ability to collect rent that is owed or to collect future rent on those properties at anticipated rates or at all or to release those properties on favorable terms as of december 31 2020 our exposure to the theater industry was 56 of total portfolio annualized contractual rent 

in addition most of our clients operate retail businesses that depend on customer traffic as a result conditions that lead to a decline in customer traffic including quarantine shelterinplace or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes or orders requiring business closures or restricting business operations have had and so long as those conditions continue to exist will continue to have an adverse effect on the business results of operations financial condition and liquidity of a number of our clients and their willingness or ability to pay rent to renew expiring leases or to enter into new leases on terms favorable to us or at all 

in addition to the nearterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on our clients and their businesses we are unable to predict at this time the broader longterm impacts on consumer behavior in regard to brickandmortar retail and servicebased businesses to the extent certain adverse factors including but not limited to continued patterns of consumer savings and unemployment persist certain discretionary businesses could have prolonged negative consequences as a result of shifts in longterm consumer behavior 

as a result of the foregoing we cannot predict the number of our clients that will not pay rent in the future nor can we predict whether our clients who have paid rent in the past will continue to do so or whether our clients who have deferred rent will pay such rent in the future as the covid19 pandemic continues our clients may cease to pay their rent obligations to us in full or at all and our clients may elect not to renew their leases seek to terminate their leases seek relief from their leases including through negotiation restructuring or bankruptcy or decline to renew expiring leases or enter into new leases all of which may adversely impact our rental revenue and occupancy rates 

table of contents 

generate additional expenses result in impairment charges or other writedowns of assets and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition as we believe to be the case with many retail landlords we have received many shortterm rent relief requests most often in the form of rent deferral requests or requests for further discussion from our clients collections and rent relief requests todate may not be indicative of collections or requests in any future period 

likewise the deterioration of global economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may ultimately lead to a further decrease in occupancy levels and rental rates across our portfolio as our clients reduce or defer their spending institute restructuring plans or file for bankruptcy some of our major clients have experienced temporary closures of some or all of their properties or have substantially reduced their operations in response to the covid19 pandemic and additional clients may do so in the future in addition the measures taken to prevent the spread of covid19 including quarantine shelterinplace or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes have led and may lead to further closures or other operational issues at our properties or delays in acquisition activities construction projects and other corporate actions all of which may materially adversely impact our operations 

in addition in light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the covid19 pandemic we have taken certain precautionary measures within our organization intended to help reduce the risk of the virus to our employees our clients and the communities in which we operate including instituting a workfromhome policy for our employees and suspending nonessential travel and inperson attendance at industry events 

while we anticipate that these measures are temporary we cannot predict the specific duration for which these precautionary measures will stay in effect and we may elect to take additional measures as the information available to us continues to develop these actions and any future actions we may take in response to the covid19 pandemic could further negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

for the foregoing reasons we expect that the impact of the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures including the impact on regional national and global economies will likely adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity and given unpredictability of the scope severity and duration of the pandemic such impacts may be material 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures continue to adversely affect regional national and global economic conditions and financial markets as well as the business results of operations financial conditions and liquidity of us and our clients it may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section including the risks resulting from our significant indebtedness our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness to pay dividends on our common stock to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness and provide for our other cash needs our ongoing need for external financing our ability to access borrowings under our credit facility and to sell notes under our commercial paper program our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness our dependency on key personnel and the impact of negative market conditions or adverse events on our clients in addition in light of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread our historical information regarding our business properties results of operations financial condition or liquidity may not be representative of the future results of operations financial condition liquidity or other financial or operating results of us our properties or our business 

in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

  we face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties we expect competition from 

  

• businesses 

• individuals 

• fiduciary accounts and plans and 

• other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

  

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential clients or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new clients release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to our clients on economically favorable terms and to collect rent from our clients on a timely basis we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

  

• lack of demand in areas where our properties are located 

• inability to retain existing clients and attract new clients 

• oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates 

• declines in our clients’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent which may be affected by their operations economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators 

• defaults by and bankruptcies of clients failure of clients to pay rent on a timely basis or failure of our clients to comply with their contractual obligations 

• the current covid19 pandemic see “risk factors — the covid19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity” above or other pandemics or outbreaks of illness disease or virus that affect countries or regions in which our clients and their parent companies operate or in which our properties or corporate headquarters are located 

• economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located and 

• deterioration of physical condition of our properties 

  

at any time any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a client may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any client bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the our client’s lease and material losses to us 

  

if our clients do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations improvements on behalf of the client or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and service our indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition our clients may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a client bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from our client’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize our client to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases although it is possible that we may not receive any unpaid future rent under terminated leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a client for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a client’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result client bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness 

as of december 31 2020  140 of our properties were available for lease or sale as of december 31 2020 no single client or group of our clients in the same industry accounted for more than 10 of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent except as described in the next paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2020 our clients in the “convenience store  us” industry accounted for approximately 119 of our annualized contractual rent a downturn in this industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial 

table of contents 

position results of operations our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock 

  

individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent for 2020 nevertheless downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our clients which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock 

  

in addition some properties are leased to clients that may have limited financial and other resources and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses including any downturns that have resulted or may result from the covid19 pandemic or in the regional national or international economy 

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

• our knowledge of the contamination 

• the timing of the contamination 

• the cause of the contamination or 

• the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims although our leases generally require our clients to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the clients’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our clients could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings that contain asbestos in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

while we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental contamination if environmental contamination should exist on any of our properties we could be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest in addition while we have environmental insurance policies that provide for a total limit of 15 million per occurrence and 70 million in the aggregate it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation andor that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our clients are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of clients’ activities on the properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor 

table of contents 

the clients generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements obtaining environmental insurance or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation however it is possible that one or more of our clients could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit it could adversely impact us and the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

we believe that commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot make any assurances that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

if we fail to satisfy any of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

• we would be required to pay regular united states or us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income 

• we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

• we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

• this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal state and in some cases foreign taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our investors 

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue services or the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect us or our investors including holders of our common stock or debt securities we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

  

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act or tcja has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders we are continuing to assess the potential impact of tcja on us as related regulations are proposed and finalized 

table of contents 

although a number of regulations related to tcja became final after 2017 there are still a number of proposed regulations open for comment and further changes may be made in light of recent changes in the us government the legislation is still unclear in some respects and could be subject to further potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation in addition state and local tax jurisdictions which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities are continuing to evaluate the legislation to determine their respective levels of conformity to the new law while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us 

  

distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that under certain circumstances may be exchanged for shares of our common stock this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of or refinance the debt on the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain similarly we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and our 10 billion commercial paper program the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility also governs our 2500 million unsecured term loan facility due march 2024 at december 31 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility or our commercial paper program a total of 830 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities excluding unamortized original issuance premiums of 146 million and deferred financing costs of 492 million including £715 million of sterlingdenominated unsecured senior debt securities 2500 million of borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility excluding deferred financing costs of 642000 and approximately 2996 million of outstanding mortgage debt 

table of contents 

excluding net unamortized premiums totaling 17 million and deferred financing costs of 973000 our revolving credit facility grants us the option subject to obtaining lender commitments and other customary conditions to expand the borrowing limits thereunder to up to 40 billion in addition in august 2020 we established our unsecured commercial paper note program under which we may offer and sell up to 10 billion of commercial paper at any time we use our 30 billion revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes issued under the commercial paper program specifically we maintain unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility equal to the aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program from time to time we also may in the future enter into amendments and restatements of our current revolving credit facility and term loan facility or enter into new revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities and any such amended restated or replacement revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities may increase the amounts we are entitled to borrow subject to customary conditions compared to our current revolving credit facility and term loan facility or we may incur other indebtedness we may also in the future increase the size of our commercial paper program to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt or to pay dividends on our common stock we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan are variable and could therefore increase over time in addition commercial paper borrowings are shortterm obligations and the interest rate on newly issued commercial paper varies according to market conditions at the time of issuance we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and ongoing global financial uncertainties including the impact of covid19 and of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union referred to as brexit we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

in addition our revolving credit facility our term loan facility and our mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock in particular our revolving credit facility and our 2500 million term loan facility all of which are governed by the same credit agreement provide that if an event of default as defined in the credit agreement exists we may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or any outstanding preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

  

• the sum of a 95 of our adjusted funds from operations as defined in the credit agreement for that period plus b the aggregate amount of cash distributions made to holders of our outstanding preferred stock if any for that period and 

• the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of any income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders 

  

except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our outstanding preferred stock if any with net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock the credit agreement further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement we and our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on except for a distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and b dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under the credit agreement were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness or prevent us from paying those dividends other distributions interest or principal altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit 

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock any outstanding preferred stock and our debt securities including 

table of contents 

  

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 

• requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

  

if we default under a credit facility loan agreement or other debt instrument the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and in the case of secured indebtedness to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral moreover a default under a single loan or debt instrument may trigger crossdefault or cross acceleration provisions in other indebtedness and debt instruments giving the holders of such other indebtedness and debt instruments similar rights to demand immediate repayment and to seize and sell any collateral 

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

• adverse changes in general or local economic conditions 

• changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties 

• changes in interest rates and operating expenses 

• competition for our clients 

• changes in market rental rates 

• inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases 

• renewal of leases at lower rental rates 

• inability to collect rents from our clients due to financial hardship including bankruptcy 

• changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate 

• uninsured property liability 

• property damage or casualty losses 

• unexpected expenditures for capital improvements including requirements to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws 

• the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties 

• risks assumed as manager for preleased development or redevelopment projects 

• physical or weatherrelated damage to properties 

• the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time 

• acts of terrorism and war and 

• acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

  

real estate property investments are illiquid we may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

we are regularly engaged in the process of identifying analyzing underwriting and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions 

table of contents 

could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions 

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singleclient net lease retail locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states and properties leased to our clients engaged in nonretail businesses these risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties new types of real estate locations and lease structures and the laws and culture of nonunited states jurisdictions 

we are subject to additional risks from our international investments 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire properties outside of the united states these investments may expose us to a variety of risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the united states our international investments are subject to additional risks including 

• the laws rules and regulations applicable in such jurisdictions outside of the united states including those related to property ownership by foreign entities 

• complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

• fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar and exchange controls 

• limited experience with local business and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices 

• challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different regions and to monitor and ensure compliance with applicable regulations such as applicable laws related to corrupt practices employment licensing construction climate change or environmental compliance 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements tax tariffs trade barriers and other laws within jurisdictions outside the united states or between the united states and such jurisdictions 

• potentially adverse tax consequences with respect to our properties 

• the impact of regional or countryspecific business cycles and economic instability including deteriorations in political relations with the united states instability in or further withdrawals from the european union or other international trade alliances or agreements and 

• political instability uncertainty over property rights civil unrest drug trafficking political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities 

if we are unable to adequately address these risks they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 

we may engage in development or expansion projects or invest in new assets which would subject us to additional risks that could negatively impact our operations 

we may engage in development or other expansion projects which would require us to raise additional capital and oversee state and local permitting a decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could prevent us from pursuing the development or expansion project additionally any such new development or expansion project may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect the inability to successfully complete development or expansion projects or to complete them on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in the future we may invest in new or different assets or enter into new transaction structures that may or may not be closely related to our current business these new assets and transaction structures may have new different or increased risks than what we are currently exposed to in our business and we may not be able to manage these risks successfully additionally when investing in such new assets or transaction structures we will be exposed to the risk that those assets or structures or the income generated thereby will affect our ability to meet the requirements to maintain our reit status if we are not able to successfully manage the risks associated with such new assets it could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties clients generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally clients are generally required at the client’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our clients are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our clients are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the client and the industry in which the client operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the clients as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the clients fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our 

results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

in addition although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects such as claims of ownership liens or other encumbrances there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property cause a financial misstatement or damage our reputation 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities while the majority of our leases are under a net lease structure some or all of such property taxes may not be collectible from our clients

our business is subject to risks associated with climate change and our sustainability strategies 

climate change could trigger extreme weather and changes in precipitation temperature and air quality all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time connectivity labor and supply chains could impact business continuity for ourselves and our customers this could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

in addition we seek to promote effective energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies and compliance with federal state and international laws and regulations related to climate change both internally and with our clients our sustainability strategies and efforts to comply with changes in federal state and international laws and regulations on climate change could result in significant capital expenditures to improve our existing properties or properties we may acquire any changes to such laws and regulations could also result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures at our properties if we are unable to comply with laws and regulations on climate change or implement effective sustainability strategies our reputation among our clients and investors may be damaged and we may incur fines andor penalties moreover there can be no assurance that any of our sustainability strategies will result in reduced operating costs higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter our existing clients from relocating to properties owned by our competitors 

we are subject to risks related to recent proposals for reform regarding libor 

certain of our existing debt instruments and other financial arrangements including our 30 billion revolving credit facility and our 2500 million term loan facility provide for borrowings to be made at variable interest rates that use the london interbank offered rate or libor or metrics derived from or related to libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings thereunder and we may incur additional indebtedness or enter into new financial arrangements that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate for borrowing thereunder 

the uk financial conduct authority which is the libor administrator’s regulator previously stated that it would no longer encourage or require banks to submit rates for libor after 2021 however for us dollar libor it now appears that the relevant date may be deferred to june 30 2023 for certain tenors including overnight and one three six and 12 months at which time the libor administrator has indicated that it intends to cease publication of us dollar libor despite this potential deferral the libor administrator has advised that no new contracts using us dollar libor should be entered into after december 31 2021 these actions are expected to cause libor to cease to exist and the adoption of alternative reference rates likewise notwithstanding a possible deferral the libor administrator’s advice that no new contracts using us dollar libor be entered into after december 31 2021 may mean that libor borrowings including libor borrowings under our credit facilities may cease to be available after that date while our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility include provisions for establishing alternative reference rates in the event libor shall no longer be available the consequences of the adoption of any such alternative reference rates cannot be predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could also affect interest rates and other financing costs under our debt instruments and other financial arrangements any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock 

our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to among other purposes assist us in maintaining our status as a reit for united states federal andor state income tax purposes for example our charter restricts any person from acquiring beneficial or constructive ownership of more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding shares of common stock these restrictions could have antitakeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

certain of our investments have the benefit of governmental tax incentives aimed at inducing retail users to relocate to incentivize development in areas and neighborhoods which have not historically seen robust commercial development the tcja provided for such communities to be designated as qualified opportunity zones which are eligible for such tax benefits these incentives typically have specific sunset provisions and may be subject to governmental discretion in the eligibility or award of the applicable incentives the expiration of these incentive programs or the inability of potential clients or users to be eligible for or to obtain governmental approval of the incentives or the inability to remain compliant with such programs may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment cash flow and net income and may result in impairment charges 

general risk factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control including 

  

• prevailing interest rates increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities 

• the market for similar securities issued by other reits 

• general economic political and financial market conditions 

• the financial condition performance and prospects of us our clients and our competitors 

• changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations 

• litigation and regulatory proceedings 

• changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us our competitors or our industry 

• changes in our credit ratings and 

• actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors 

  

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the united states trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

litigation risks could affect our business 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our clients our business or the united states or world generally 

if events like these were to occur they could materially interrupt our business operations cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these 

table of contents 

occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and maintenance of records which may include personal identifying information although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the theft of intellectual property personal information or personal property such as in the event of cyberattacks any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations result in theft of company assets damage our reputation subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms 

campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company if we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future our business could be adversely affected as such activities could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties clients and financing sources and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or existing sellers of properties clients or financing sources choose to delay defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues then our results of operations could be adversely affected similarly we may suffer damage to our reputation for example regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities resulting in significant loss of value which could impact our ability to access capital increase our cost of capital and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our internal controls over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and disclosures our reit qualification being jeopardized impairment in our access to capital civil litigation or investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash 

table of contents 

in the future we cannot make any assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

historically there have been periods where the global equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of equity and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the equity or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the equity and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

  

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect our clients’ ability to pay rent in addition the uk governments plan to reform the retail price index rpi to align with the consumer price index cpih may result in a lower measure of inflation and in turn have a negative impact on our lease revenue currently tied to rpi in the uk

liquidity and capital resources 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility commercial paper program or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowings on our credit facility and under our commercial paper program and through public securities offerings

acquisitions during 2020 

below is a listing of our acquisitions in the us and uk for the year ended december 31 2020 



1 the initial average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that our client could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above contractual net operating income for the fourth quarter of 2020 includes approximately 700000 received as a settlement credit for a property acquired in the us as reimbursement of a free rent period 

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the initial average cash lease yield is computed as follows estimated cash net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs 

2 none of our investments during 2020 caused any one client to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2020 all of our investments in acquired properties during 2020 are 100 leased at the acquisition date 

3 represents investments of £7078 million sterling during the year ended december 31 2020 converted at the applicable exchange rate on the date of acquisition 

4 our clients occupying the new properties operate in 26 industries and are 866 retail and 134 industrial based on rental revenue approximately 61 of the rental revenue generated from acquisitions during 2020 is from our investment grade rated clients their subsidiaries or affiliated companies

leasing results 

at december 31 2020 we had 140 properties available for lease out of 6592 properties in our portfolio which represents a 979 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio 

the following tables summarize our leasing results for the periods indicated below 



1 includes scheduled and unscheduled expirations including leases rejected in bankruptcy as well as future expirations resolved in the current quarter 

2 the annual new rent on these releases was 2101 million as compared to the previous annual rent of 2095 million on the same properties representing a rent recapture rate of 1003 on the properties released during the three months ended december 31 2020 

3 released all five properties to new clients after a period of vacancy 

table of contents 



1 includes scheduled and unscheduled expirations including leases rejected in bankruptcy as well as future expirations resolved in the current year 

2 the annual new rent on these releases was 6624 million as compared to the previous annual rent of 6626 million on the same properties representing a rent recapture rate of 1000 on the properties released during the year ended december 31 2020 

3 released five properties to new clients without a period of vacancy and 13 properties to new clients after a period of vacancy 

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide rent concessions to our clients we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or rent concessions to our clients to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

at december 31 2020 our average annualized contractual rent was approximately 1538 per square foot on the 6452 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2020 we classified 21 properties with a carrying amount of 190 million as real estate and lease intangibles held for sale net on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

  

investments in existing properties 

during 2020 we capitalized costs of 70 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 18 million for releasing costs 198000 for recurring capital expenditures and 50 million for nonrecurring building improvements in comparison during 2019 we capitalized costs of 179 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 21 million for releasing costs 801000 for recurring capital expenditures and 150 million for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market credit worthiness of our clients the lease term and the willingness of our clients to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and recurring landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements in which we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 52year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2020 and once in 2021 as of february 2021 we have paid 93 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 109 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 



table of contents 

  

the dividends paid per share during 2020 totaled 27940 as compared to 27105 during 2019 an increase of 00835 or 31 

  

the monthly dividend of 02345 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 281 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 45 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 6217 on december 31 2020 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when acquiring a property for investment purposes we typically allocate the cost of real estate acquired inclusive of transaction costs to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their relative estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value and the value of inplace leases as applicable additionally above–market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as financing receivables amortizing over the lease term while below–market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as prepaid rent in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value of the land building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities and is often based upon the various characteristics of the market where the property is located in addition any assumed mortgages are recorded at their estimated fair values the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors such as industry type client investment grade maturity date and comparable borrowings for similar assets the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property a fair value analysis is performed and to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the current book value a provision for impairment is recorded to reduce the book value to estimated fair value key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

when assessing the collectability of future lease payments one of the key factors we have considered during 2020 has been the covid19 pandemic we generally assess collectability based on an analysis of creditworthiness 

table of contents 

economic trends and other facts and circumstances related to our applicable clients if the collection of substantially all of the future lease payments is less than probable we will writeoff the receivable balances associated with the lease and cease to recognize lease income including straightline rent unless cash is received when due unless otherwise specified references to reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue include amounts reserved for in the current period as well as unrecognized contractual rental revenue and unrecognized straightline rental revenue for leases accounted for on a cash basis as of december 31 2020 other than the information related to the reserves we have recorded to such date we do not have any further client specific information that would change our assessment that collection of substantially all of the future lease payments under our existing leases is probable however there may be impacts in future periods that could change this assessment as the situation continues to evolve and as more information becomes available 

the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread are negatively impacting the economy across many industries including the industries in which some of our clients operate these impacts may continue and increase in severity as the duration or extent of the pandemic increases which may in turn adversely impact the fair value estimates of our real estate and require the recording of impairments on our properties as a result we evaluated certain key assumptions involving fair value estimates of our real estate recording of impairments on our properties and collectability of our accounts receivable we continue to evaluate the potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread on our business and industry segments as the situation continues to evolve and more information becomes available 

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

  

total revenue 

the following summarizes our total revenue dollars in thousands 



  

rental revenue excluding reimbursable 

the table below summarizes the increase in rental revenue excluding reimbursable in 2020 compared to 2019 dollars in thousands 



1 relates to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 174 properties comprising 2973551 square feet that were available for lease during part of 2020 or 2019 ii rental revenue for properties 6 properties comprising 943004 square feet under development and iii lease termination settlements 

table of contents 

the table below summarizes the increase in rental revenue excluding reimbursable in 2019 compared to 2018 dollars in thousands 



1 relates to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 130 properties comprising 3249304 square feet that were available for lease during part of 2019 or 2018 ii rental revenue for properties 10 properties comprising 1404360 square feet under development and iii lease termination settlements 

for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were vacant at any time ii were under development or redevelopment or iii were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

our calculation of same store rental revenue includes rent deferred for future payment as a result of lease concessions we granted in response to the covid19 pandemic and recognized under the practical expedient provided by the financial accounting standards board fasb same store rental revenue in 2020 was negatively impacted by reserves recorded as reductions of rental revenue of 399 million compared to 14 million in 2019 there was no same store rental income impact by reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue in 2018 our calculation of same store rental revenue also includes uncollected rent for which we have not granted a lease concession if these applicable amounts of rent deferrals and uncollected rent were excluded from our calculation of same store rental revenue the decrease for 2020 relative to 2019 would have been 51 

rental revenue was negatively impacted by rent reserves during 2020 primarily due to the covid19 pandemic particularly with respect to the ongoing disruption to the theater industry the following table summarizes reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue dollars in millions 



of the 6592 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2020 6555 or 994 are singleclient properties and the remaining are multiclient properties of the 6555 singleclient properties 6419 or 979 were net leased at december 31 2020 of our 6419 leased singleclient properties 5486 or 855 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

• base rent increases tied to a consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 

• percentage rent based on a percentage of our clients gross sales 

• fixed increases or 

• a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 51 million in 2020 80 million in 2019 and 59 million in 2018 percentage rent in 2020 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2021 

  

at december 31 2020 our portfolio of 6592 properties was 979 leased with 140 properties available for lease as compared to 986 leased with 94 properties available for lease at december 31 2019 it has been our 

table of contents 

experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease or sale could increase in the future given the nature of economic cycles and other unforeseen global events such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread 

  

rental revenue reimbursable 

a number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses the increase in contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients in the years presented is primarily due to the growth of our portfolio due to acquisitions 

other revenue 

the increase in other revenue for 2020 was primarily related to interest income recognized on financing receivables for certain leases with abovemarket terms as compared to 2019 in addition interest income from our money market accounts was higher for 2020 as compared to 2019 which is primarily due to higher average investment balances 

total expenses 

the following summarizes our total expenses dollars in thousands 

  



1 general and administrative expenses for 2020 included an executive severance charge related to the departure of our former cfo in march 2020 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 3463 and was recorded to general and administrative expense in order to present a normalized calculation of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue for 2020 we have excluded this executive severance charge to arrive at a normalized general and administrative amount of 69752 which was used for our calculation general and administrative expenses for 2018 included a one–time severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 28293 however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 18651 and was recorded to general and administrative expense in order to present a normalized calculation of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue for 2018 we have excluded this one–time executive severance charge to arrive at a normalized general and administrative amount of 65497 which was used for our calculation executive severance charges are excluded from adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders or affo which is not a financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles see our discussion of affo which includes a reconciliation of this amount 

2 excludes rental revenue reimbursable 

depreciation and amortization 

the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2020 and 2019 which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo” and “adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo 

  

table of contents 

interest expense 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 



the increase in interest expense from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to the october 2020 issuance of our 1625 notes due 2030 may and july 2020 issuances of our 2031 notes the may 2019 issuance of our 2730 notes due 2034 the june 2019 issuance of our 3250 notes due 2029 and higher interest related to mortgages assumed during december 2019 partially offset by the january 2020 repayment of our 5750 notes due 2021 the june 2020 repayment of one of our 2500 million term loans and lower average interest rates 

the increase in interest expense from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the october 2018 issuance of our 2500 million senior unsecured term loan the may 2019 issuance of our 2730 notes due 2034 the june 2019 issuance of our 3250 notes due 2029 and a loss on our interest rate swaps in 2019 

at december 31 2020 the weighted average interest rate on our 

• term loan outstanding of 2500 million excluding deferred financing costs of 642000 and considering that one of our 2500 million term loans was paid off in june 2020 was swapped to fixed at 39 

• mortgages payable of 2996 million excluding net premiums totaling 17 million and deferred financing costs of 973000 on these mortgages was 49 

• notes and bonds payable of 830 billion excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of 146 million and deferred financing costs of 492 million was 34 and 

• combined outstanding notes bonds mortgages and term loan of 885 billion excluding all net premiums and deferred financing costs was 35 

  

property expenses excluding reimbursable 

property expenses excluding reimbursable consist of costs associated with properties available for lease nonnetleased properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to properties available for lease and nonnetleased properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2020 140 properties were available for lease as compared to 94 at december 31 2019 and 80 at december 31 2018 

the increase in property expenses excluding reimbursable in 2020 is primarily due to reserves for contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients an increase in repairs and maintenance expense and an increase in portfolio size and the number of vacant properties at yearend 

property expenses reimbursable 

the increase in property expenses reimbursable in both 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size which contributed to higher contractually obligated reimbursements from our clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses primarily due to our acquisitions in each year 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses are expenditures related to the operations of our company including employee–related costs professional fees and other general overhead costs associated with running our business 

table of contents 

general and administrative expenses increased in 2020 primarily due to a severance charge of 35 million for our former cfo who departed the company in march 2020 higher payrollrelated costs and higher corporate–level professional fees partially offset by lower costs for terminated acquisitions and travel the decrease in general and administrative costs in 2019 is primarily due to the severance charge of 187 million incurred in 2018 that related to our former ceo who departed the company in october 2018 

income taxes 

income taxes are for city and state income and franchise taxes and for uk income taxes paid by us and our subsidiaries the increase in income taxes in 2020 was primarily attributable to our uk investments which contributed to higher uk income taxes as compared to 2019 

  

provisions for impairment 

the following table summarizes provisions for impairment during the periods indicated below dollars in millions 



during 2020 we identified the impact of the covid19 pandemic as an impairment triggering event for properties occupied by certain of our clients experiencing difficulties meeting their lease obligations to us after considering the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on the key assumptions we determined that the carrying values of 38 properties classified as held for investment for the year ended december 31 2020 were not recoverable as a result we recorded provisions for impairment of 1050 million for the year ended december 31 2020 on the applicable properties impacted by the covid19 pandemic of the provisions for impairment recorded during 2020 for properties impacted by the covid19 pandemic a total of 13 assets occupied by certain of our clients in the theater industry were impaired for 838 million which reduced the carrying value of the properties from 1234 million to their estimated fair value of 396 million impairments recorded on other properties during the year ended december 31 2020 totaled 422 million 

  

gain on sales of real estate 

the following table summarizes our properties sold during the periods indicated below dollars in millions 



foreign currency and derivative gains net 

we borrow in the functional currencies of the countries in which we invest foreign currency gains and losses are primarily a result of intercompany debt and certain remeasurement transactions 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in january 2020 we completed the early redemption on all 2500 million in principal amount of outstanding 575 notes due january 2021 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a 98 million loss on extinguishment of debt during 2020

net income available to common stockholders 

the following summarizes our net income available to common stockholders dollars in millions except per share data 



1 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes provisions for impairment gains from the sale of properties and foreign currency gains and losses which can vary from period to period based on timing and significantly impact net income attributable to the company and available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders in 2020 was impacted by the following transactions i 1472 million of provisions for impairment ii 525 million in reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue iii a 98 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to the january 2020 early redemption of the 5750 notes due 2021 and iv a 35 million executive severance charge for our former cfo for 2019 the only comparable charges were 402 million in provisions for impairment and 29 million in reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue 

net income available to common stockholders in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 283 million however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 187 million 

adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate adjusted ebitda re  

the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit came to the conclusion that a nareitdefined ebitda metric for real estate companies ie ebitda for real estate or ebitda re  would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among reits our definition of “adjusted ebitda re ” is generally consistent with the nareit definition other than our adjustments to remove foreign currency and derivative gains and losses and executive severance charges which is consistent with our previous calculations of adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda re  a non–gaap financial measure for the most recent quarter as earnings net income before i interest expense including noncash loss gain on swaps ii income and franchise taxes iii real estate depreciation and amortization iv provisions for impairment v gain on sales of real estate vi foreign currency and derivative gains and losses net and vii executive severance charges as described in the adjusted funds from operations section our adjusted ebitda re may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda re reported by other companies or as defined by nareit and other companies may interpret or define adjusted ebitda re differently than we do management believes adjusted ebitda re to be a meaningful measure of a reit’s performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts lenders and investors management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly adjusted ebitda re metric which we refer to as annualized adjusted ebitda re  is meaningful because it represents the company’s current earnings run rate for the period presented the ratio of our total debt to our annualized quarterly adjusted ebitda re is also used to determine vesting of performance share awards granted to our executive officers adjusted ebitda re should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance we define annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re as annualized adjusted ebitda re  subject to certain adjustments to incorporate operating income from properties we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and to remove operating income from properties we disposed of during the applicable quarter giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period we believe annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re is a useful nongaap supplemental measure as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter our ratios of net debttoadjusted ebitda re and net debttopro forma adjusted ebitda re  which are used by management as a measure of leverage are calculated as net debt which we define as total debt per the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents divided by annualized quarterly adjusted ebitda re and annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re  respectively 

table of contents 

the following table summarizes our adjusted ebitda re calculation for the periods indicated below 



  

1 net income for 2020 was negatively impacted by 181 million of rent reserves recorded as reductions of rental revenue of which 33 million relates to straightline rent 

2 the executive severance charge in 2018 reflects an 187 million severance charge for our former ceo upon his departure in october 2018 

3 we calculate annualized adjusted ebitdare by multiplying the quarterly adjusted ebitdare by four 

4 net debt is total debt per the consolidated balance sheet less of cash and cash equivalents 

the annualized pro forma adjustments consist of adjustments to incorporate operating income from properties we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and to remove operating income from properties we disposed of during the applicable quarter giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period the annualized pro forma adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes and bonds the following table summarizes our annualized pro forma adjusted ebitda re calculation for the periods indicated below 



funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

the following summarizes our ffo dollars in millions except per share data 



1 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

ffo in 2020 was impacted by reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue related to the covid19 pandemic a loss on extinguishment of debt due to the early redemption of the 5750 notes due 2021 in january 2020 and an executive severance charge for our former cfo in march 2020 

table of contents 

ffo in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 283 million however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 187 million 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 



we define ffo a nongaap financial measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trusts definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus provisions for impairments of depreciable real estate assets and reduced by gains on property sales 

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure 

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

the following summarizes our affo dollars in millions except per share data 



1 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

affo for 2020 was impacted by reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue related to the covid19 pandemic 

table of contents 

we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance other companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term “cad” for cash available for distribution “fad” for funds available for distribution or other terms our affo calculations may not be comparable to affo cad or fad reported by other companies and other companies may interpret or define such terms differently than we do 

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  



1 as of december 31 2020 there was 245 million of uncollected rent deferred as a result of lease concessions we granted in response to the covid19 pandemic and recognized under the practical expedient provided by the fasb and 519 million of uncollected rent for which we have not granted a lease concession deferrals accounted for as modifications totaling 236000 for 2020 have not been added back to affo 

2 see reconciling items for ffo presented under “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo” 

3 the executive severance charge in 2020 represents the incremental costs incurred upon our former cfos departure in march 2020 consisting of 16 million of cash 18 million of sharebased compensation expense and 58000 of professional fees the executive severance charge in 2018 represents the incremental costs incurred upon our former ceos departure in october 2018 consisting of 98 million of cash 179 million of sharebased compensation expense and 574000 of professional fees reduced by 96 million accrued for ceo compensation prior to separation 

4 includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized upon issuance of our notes payable assumption of our mortgages payable and upon issuance of our current and previous term loans the deferred financing costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages and term loans no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

5 straightline payments from crosscurrency swaps represent quarterly payments in us dollars received by us from counterparties in exchange for associated foreign currency payments these usd payments are fixed and determinable for the duration of the associated hedging transaction 

table of contents 

6 includes adjustments allocable to noncontrolling interests obligations related to financing lease liabilities and foreign currency gains and losses as a result of intercompany debt and remeasurement transactions 

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

  

presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity our ability to make cash distributions or our ability to pay interest payments

leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings or increases in the clients’ sales volumes we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

moreover our use of net lease agreements tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the client is responsible for property expenses inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue

for information on the impact of newly adopted accounting standards on our business see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and commercial paper program term loan mortgages payable and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

  

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps interest rate locks and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

table of contents 

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed rate debt as of december 31 2020 there was no variable rate debt or debt that was not swapped to fixed at december 31 2020 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  expected maturity data 



1 excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable net original issuance premiums recorded on notes payable and deferred financing costs on mortgages payable notes payable and our term loan at december 31 2020 the unamortized balance of net premiums on mortgages payable is 17 million the unamortized balance of net original issuance premiums on notes payable is 146 million and the balance of deferred financing costs on mortgages payable is 973000 on notes payable is 492 million and on our term loan is 642000 

2 we base the estimated fair value of the publiclytraded fixed rate senior notes and bonds at december 31 2020 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate mortgages at december 31 2020 on the relevant forward interest rate curve plus an applicable creditadjusted spread we believe that the carrying value of the term loan balance reasonably approximates its estimated fair value at december 31 2020 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2020 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

at december 31 2020 our outstanding notes bonds and mortgages payable had fixed interest rates interest on our revolving credit facility and term loan balance is variable however the variable interest rate feature on our term loan has been mitigated by an interest rate swap agreement at december 31 2020 our credit facility balance was zero however we intend to borrow funds on our credit facility in the future based on a hypothetical credit facility borrowing of 50 million a 1 change in interest rate would change our interest costs by 500000 annually 

during 2019 we commenced foreign operations and acquired real property in the uk and have continued to acquire uk properties in 2020 as a result we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of sterling relative to the us dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in the uk we mitigate these foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and crosscurrency swaps if we increase our international presence through investments in properties outside the us we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than us dollars

changes in internal controls 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

recent developments 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 51year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2019 and twice during 2020 as of february 2020 we have paid 89 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 105 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 



  

the dividends paid per share during 2019 totaled 27105 as compared to 26305 during 2018 an increase of 008 or 30 

  

the monthly dividend of 02325 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 279 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 38 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 7363 on december 31 2019 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

acquisitions during 2019 

below is a listing of our acquisitions in the us and uk for the year ended december 31 2019 



 

the initial average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the initial average cash lease yield 

 3  

is computed as follows estimated cash net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2019  we had 94 properties available for lease out of 6483 properties in our portfolio which represents a 986 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio 

the following table summarizes our leasing results for the year ended december 31 2019 



 

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

at december 31 2019  our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1488 per square foot on the 6389 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2019  we classified 23 properties with a carrying amount of 968 million  as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2019  we capitalized costs of 179 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 21 million for releasing costs 801000 for recurring capital expenditures and 150 million for nonrecurring building improvements in 2018 we capitalized costs of 179 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 39 million for releasing costs 11 million for recurring capital expenditures and 129 million for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and recurring landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements in which we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties 

addition to the sp 500 dividend aristocrats ® 

in february 2020 we were added to the sp 500 dividend aristocrats ® index for having increased our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years

select financial results 

the following summarizes our select financial results dollars in millions except per share data 



1 the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes provisions for impairment gain from the sales of real estate and foreign currency gains and losses these items can vary from quarter to quarter and can significantly impact net income and period to period comparisons 

2 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

net income available to common stockholders in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 283 million however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 187 million equivalent to 006 per share 

see our discussion of ffo and affo which are not financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles or gaap later in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and affo 

  

dividend policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock 

  

distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of realty income lp each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders 

in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2019 our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 8521 million or approximately 1315 of our estimated taxable income of 6480 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our cash distributions to common stockholders in 2019 totaled 8521 million representing 812 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common 

 6  

stockholders of 105 billion  in comparison our 2018 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 7616 million  representing 824 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 9246 million  

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year however noncorporate stockholders including individuals generally may deduct up to 20 of dividends from a reit other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 

  

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 218 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2019 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we estimate that in 2020 between 15 and 25 of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital 

business philosophy and strategy 

  

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income a net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on 1 increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 2 fixed increases or 3 additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm net lease agreements generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy we believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant industry geography and property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio that as of december 31 2019 consisted of 6483 properties located in 49 us states puerto rico and the uk leased to 301 different commercial tenants doing business in 50 industries each of the 50 industries represented in our property portfolio accounted for no more than 119 of our rental revenue during the year ended december 31 2019  

  

investment strategy 

when identifying new properties for investment we generally focus on acquiring highquality real estate that tenants consider important to the successful operation of their business we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

  



 7  

   

we seek to invest in properties owned by tenants that are already or could become leaders in their respective businesses supported by mechanisms including but not limited to occupancy of prime real estate locations pricing merchandise assortment service quality economies of scale consumer branding and advertising in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of singletenant properties net leased to different tenants operating in a variety of industries we have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities often using our relationships with various tenants ownersdevelopers brokers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions we also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations tenants and industries for investment this research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value 

  

in selecting potential investments we look for tenants with the following attributes 

  

   

from a retail perspective our investment strategy is to target tenants that have a service nondiscretionary andor lowpricepoint component to their business we believe these characteristics better position tenants to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers as a result of the execution of this strategy approximately 96 of our annualized retail rental revenue at december 31 2019 is derived from tenants with a service nondiscretionary andor low price point component to their business from a nonretail perspective we target industrial properties generally leased to industry leaders that are primarily investment grade rated companies we believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties 

  

after applying this investment strategy we pursue those transactions where we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable riskadjusted returns we will continue to evaluate all investments consistent with our objective of owning net lease assets 

  

underwriting strategy 

in order to be considered for acquisition properties must meet stringent underwriting requirements we have established a fourpart analysis to examine each potential investment based on 

  

 

we believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligation is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive therefore in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property 

  

thus as the property owner we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate 

 8  

leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition 

  

prior to entering into any transaction our research department conducts a review of a tenant’s credit quality the information reviewed may include reports and filings including any public credit ratings financial statements debt and equity analyst reports and reviews of corporate credit spreads stock prices market capitalization and other financial metrics we conduct additional due diligence including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates we continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed and providing summaries of these findings to management approximately 49 of our annualized rental revenue is generated from properties leased to investment grade tenants their subsidiaries or affiliated companies at december 31 2019  our top 20 tenants represented approximately 53 of our annualized revenue and 12 of these tenants have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries of investment grade companies 

  

asset management strategy 

in addition to pursuing new properties for investment we seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through active asset management 

  

generally our asset management efforts seek to achieve 

  

   

we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our tenants our tenants’ industries and the real estate locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality our active portfolio and asset management strategy pursues asset sales when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

   

the active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy of maintaining high occupancy since 1970 our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 however we cannot assure you that our future occupancy levels will continue to equal or exceed 96 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our credit facility and through public securities offerings

we may choose to mitigate our financial exposure to exchange rate risk for properties acquired outside the us through the issuance of debt securities denominated in the same local currency and through currency derivatives we may leave a portion of our foreign cash flow unhedged to reinvest in additional properties in the same local currency 

for 2020 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate reaching approximately 200 to 225 million in property sales we plan to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during 2020 at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2019  our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 793 billion  or approximately 244 of our total market capitalization of 3253 billion  

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2019 as the sum of 

  

 

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the global credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and global credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

universal shelf registration 

in november 2018 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in november 2021 in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

revolving credit facility 

in august 2019 we amended and restated our unsecured credit facility or our credit facility in order to allow borrowings in multiple currencies the amended and restated credit facility is otherwise substantively consistent with the prior credit agreement entered into in october 2018 our credit facility consists of a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial term that expires in march 2023 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions and a 2500 million unsecured term loan due march 2024 the unsecured revolving credit facility allows us to borrow in up to 14 currencies including us dollars and has a 10 billion expansion option under our credit facility our investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2019 provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 0775 with a facility commitment fee of 0125  for allin drawn pricing of 090 over libor 

 10  

the borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings change we also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility our revolving credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2019  we had a borrowing capacity of 23 billion available on our revolving credit facility and an outstanding balance of 7043 million  including £1692 million sterling the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility during 2019 was 31 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2019  we were in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend renew or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 540 million  inclusive of £307 million sterling 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our revolving credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies as of december 31 2019  we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of a3 with a “stable” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of a with a “stable” outlook and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our ratings as of december 31 2019  the facility interest rate was libor plus 0775 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 090 over libor our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 145 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 075 if our credit rating is aa2 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 030 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 010 for a credit rating of aa2 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock

property portfolio information 

  

at december 31 2019  we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

   

at december 31 2019  6389 properties were leased under net lease agreements a net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition our tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level or fixed increases 

  

at december 31 2019  our 301 commercial tenants which we define as retailers with over 50 locations and nonretailers with over 500 million in annual revenues represented approximately 95 of our annualized revenue we had 329 additional tenants representing approximately 5 of our annualized revenue at december 31 2019  which brings our total tenant count to 630 tenants

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

this “risk factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders” unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock 

in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

  we face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties we expect competition from 

  



 20  

   

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

  

   

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us 

  

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a tenant for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness 

as of december 31 2019  94 of our properties were available for lease or sale as of december 31 2019  100 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2019 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

for 2019  our tenants in the “convenience store” industry accounted for approximately 119 of our rental revenue a downturn in this industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock 

 21  

  

individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2019  nevertheless downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock 

  

in addition some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have limited financial and other resources and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional national or international economy 

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

   

there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings that contain asbestos in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation andor that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of tenants’ activities on the properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements obtaining environmental insurance or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation however it is possible that one or more of our tenants could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities 

 22  

  

compliance   we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

  

insurance and indemnity   in march 2018 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in march 2028 which replaced our previous tenyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 60 million in the aggregate the limits on the excess policy are 5 million per occurrence and 10 million in the aggregate therefore the primary and excess tenyear policies together provide a total limit of 15 million per occurrence and 70 million in the aggregate 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

we believe that commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot make any assurances that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

if we fail to satisfy any of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

   

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal state and in some cases foreign taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

 23  

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our investors 

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue services or the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect us or our investors including holders of our common stock or debt securities we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

  

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act or tcja has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders we are continuing to assess the potential impact of tcja on us as related regulations are proposed and finalized 

although a number of regulations related to tcja became final in 2018 and 2019 there are still a number of proposed regulations open for comment the legislation is still unclear in some respects and could be subject to further potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation in addition state and local tax jurisdictions which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities are continuing to evaluate the legislation to determine their respective levels of conformity to the new law while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us 

  

distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that under certain circumstances may be exchanged for shares of our common stock this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of or refinance the debt on the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain similarly we may be required to incur or 

 24  

maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our revolving credit facility the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility also governs our two existing 2500 million unsecured term loan facilities at december 31 2019  we had 7043 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility a total of 632 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities excluding unamortized original issuance premiums of 63 million and deferred financing costs of 359 million  5000 million of borrowings outstanding under our two term loan facilities excluding deferred financing costs of 956000  and approximately 4084 million of outstanding mortgage debt excluding net unamortized premiums totaling 30 million and deferred financing costs of 13 million on this mortgage debt our revolving credit facility grants us the option subject to customary conditions to expand the borrowing limits thereunder to up to 40 billion we also may in the future enter into amendments and restatements of our current revolving credit facility and term loan facilities or enter into new revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities and any such amended restated or replacement revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities may increase the amounts we are entitled to borrow subject to customary conditions compared to our current revolving credit facility and term loan facilities or we may incur other indebtedness to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility our term loans and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis uncertainties including the impact of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union referred to as brexit we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

  

in addition our revolving credit facility our term loan facilities and our mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions to holders of our common stock and preferred stock in particular our revolving credit facility and our two 2500 million term loan facilities all of which are governed by the same credit agreement provide that if an event of default as defined in the credit agreement exists we may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

  

   

except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our outstanding preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock the credit agreement further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement we and our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on except for a distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and b dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under the credit agreement were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to holders of our common stock and preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness or prevent us from paying those dividends other distributions interest or principal altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit 

 25  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities including 

  

   

if we default under a debt instrument the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and in the case of secured indebtedness to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral moreover a default under a single loan or debt instrument may trigger crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions in other indebtedness and debt instruments giving the holders of such other indebtedness and debt instruments similar rights to demand immediate repayment and to seize and sell any collateral 

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot make any assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control including 

  

   

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the united states trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  



 26  

   

real estate property investments are illiquid we may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

we are engaged in the process of identifying analyzing underwriting and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions 

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant net lease locations we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and properties leased to tenants engaged in nonretail businesses including risks resulting from our limited experience in managing underwriting and assessing risks related to such properties or understanding the market dynamics applicable to such properties tenants or lease structures any of which could also have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

we are subject to additional risks from our international investments 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire properties outside of the united states these investments may expose us to a variety of risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the united states our international investments are subject to additional risks including 



 27  

 

if we are unable to adequately address these risks they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 

we may engage in development or expansion projects or invest in new assets which would subject us to additional risks that could negatively impact our operations 

we may engage in development or other expansion projects which would require us to raise additional capital and oversee state and local permitting a decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could prevent us from pursuing the development or expansion project additionally any such new development or expansion project may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect the inability to successfully complete development or expansion projects or to complete them on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in the future we may invest in new or different assets that may or may not be closely related to our current business these new assets may have new different or increased risks than what we are currently exposed to in our business and we may not be able to manage these risks successfully additionally when investing in such new assets we will be exposed to the risk that those assets or the income generated thereby will affect our ability to meet the requirements to maintain our reit status if we are not able to successfully manage the risks associated with such new assets it could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our 

results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

in addition although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects such as claims of ownership liens or other encumbrances there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property cause a financial misstatement or damage our reputation 

  

 28  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

litigation risks could affect our business 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities while the majority of our leases are under a net lease structure some or all of such property taxes may not be collectible from our tenants 

  

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry 

  

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our tenants our business or the united states or world generally 

if events like these were to occur they could materially interrupt our business operations cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

our business is subject to risks associated with climate change and our sustainability strategies 

climate change could trigger extreme weather and changes in precipitation temperature and air quality all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected 

 29  

in addition we seek to promote effective energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies and compliance with federal state and international laws and regulations related to climate change both internally and with our tenants our sustainability strategies and efforts to comply with changes in federal state and international laws and regulations on climate change could result in significant capital expenditures to improve our existing properties or properties we may acquire any changes to such laws and regulations could also result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures at our properties if we are unable to comply with laws and regulations on climate change or implement effective sustainability strategies our reputation among our tenants and investors may be damaged and we may incur fines andor penalties moreover there can be no assurance that any of our sustainability strategies will result in reduced operating costs higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter our existing tenants from relocating to properties owned by our competitors 

  

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and maintenance of records which may include personal identifying information although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the theft of intellectual property personal information or personal property such as in the event of cyberattacks any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations result in theft of company assets damage our reputation subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

historically there have been periods where the global equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of equity and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the equity or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the equity and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

  

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

 30  

inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our internal controls over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and disclosures our reit qualification being jeopardized impairment in our access to capital civil litigation or investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to recent proposals for reform regarding libor 

certain of our existing debt instruments and other financial arrangements including our 30 billion revolving credit facility and our 2500 million term loan facilities provide for borrowings to be made at variable interest rates that use the london interbank offered rate or libor or metrics derived from or related to libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings thereunder and we may incur additional indebtedness or enter into new financial arrangements that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate for borrowing thereunder libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform in 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 these reforms may cause libor to cease to exist new methods of calculating libor to be established or the establishment of alternative reference rates these consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could also affect interest rates and other financing costs under our debt instruments and other financial arrangements any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms 

campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company if we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future our business could be adversely affected as such activities could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties tenants and financing sources and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or existing sellers of properties tenants or financing sources choose to delay defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues then our results of operations could be adversely affected similarly we may suffer damage to our reputation for example regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities resulting in significant loss of value which could impact our ability to access capital increase our cost of capital and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms 

  

our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock 

our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to among other purposes assist us in maintaining our status as a reit for united states federal andor state income tax purposes for example our charter restricts any person from acquiring beneficial or constructive ownership of more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding shares of common stock these restrictions could have antitakeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

the value of certain of our investment in real property may be reduced as the result of the expiration or loss of local tax abatements tax credit programs or other governmental incentives 

certain of our investments have the benefit of governmental tax incentives aimed at inducing retail users to relocate to incentivize development in areas and neighborhoods which have not historically seen robust commercial development the tcja provided for such communities to be designated as qualified opportunity zones which are 

 31  

eligible for such tax benefits these incentives typically have specific sunset provisions and may be subject to governmental discretion in the eligibility or award of the applicable incentives the expiration of these incentive programs or the inability of potential tenants or users to be eligible for or to obtain governmental approval of the incentives or the inability to remain compliant with such programs may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment cash flow and net income and may result in impairment charges

liquidity and capital resources 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common or preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2019  our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 79 billion  or approximately 244 of our total market capitalization of 325 billion  

 35  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2019 as the sum of 

  

 

universal shelf registration 

in november 2018 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in november 2021 in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or our drspp provides our common stockholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions our drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions our drspp authorizes up to 26000000 common shares to be issued our drspp includes a waiver approval process allowing larger investors or institutions per a formal approval process to purchase shares at a small discount if approved by us we did not issue shares under the waiver approval process during 2019 or 2018 at december 31 2019  we had 11652668 shares remaining for future issuance under our drspp program 

 36  

the following table outlines common stock issuances pursuant to our drspp program dollars in millions 

revolving credit facility 

in august 2019 we amended and restated our unsecured credit facility or our credit facility in order to allow borrowings in multiple currencies the amended and restated credit facility is otherwise substantively consistent with the prior credit agreement entered into in october 2018 our credit facility consists of a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial term that expires in march 2023 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions and a 2500 million unsecured term loan due march 2024 the unsecured revolving credit facility allows us to borrow in up to 14 currencies including us dollars and has a 10 billion expansion option under our credit facility our investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2019 provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 0775 with a facility commitment fee of 0125  for allin drawn pricing of 090 over libor 

the borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings change we also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2019  we had a borrowing capacity of 23 billion available on our revolving credit facility and an outstanding balance of 7043 million  including £1692 million sterling the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility during 2019 was 31 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2019  we were in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend renew or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

term loans

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2019  we had 4084 million of mortgages payable all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions additionally at december 31 2019  we had net premiums totaling 30 million on these mortgages and deferred financing costs of 13 million  we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that would make it economically feasible to do so during 2019 we made 207 million of principal payments including the repayment of one mortgage in full for 158 million  

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2019  sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 



1 represents the principal balance in us dollars of the sterlingdenominated private placement of £3150 million sterling converted at the applicable exchange rate on december 31 2019  

in may 2019 we issued £3150 million sterling of 2730 senior unsecured notes due 2034 through a private placement

the net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility to fund investment opportunities and for other general corporate purposes 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants with which we remained in compliance as of december 31 2019  additionally interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 

  

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds these calculations which are not based on us gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2019 are 



  1 our debt service coverage ratio is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding fourquarter period on the assumptions that i the incurrence of any debt as defined in the covenants incurred by us since the first day of such fourquarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom including to refinance other debt since the first day of such fourquarter period ii the repayment or retirement of any of 

 38  

our debt since the first day of such fourquarter period and iii any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on january 1 2019 and subject to certain additional adjustments such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses i ii and iii of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1 2019 nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period the following is our calculation of debt service and fixed charge coverage at december 31 2019 in thousands for trailing twelve months 

authorized shares 

in may 2019 our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock under our articles of incorporation to 740200000 from 370100000 

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 540 million  inclusive of £307 million sterling 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our revolving credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies as of december 31 2019  we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of a3 with a “stable” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of a with a “stable” outlook and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our ratings as of december 31 2019  the facility interest rate was libor plus 0775 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 090 over libor our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 145 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 075 if our credit rating is aa2 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 030 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 010 for a credit rating of aa2 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock

1 the initial term of the credit facility expires in march 2023 and includes at our option two six–month extensions 

2 excludes both non–cash original issuance discounts and premiums recorded on notes payable of 63 million and deferred financing costs of 359 million at december 31 2019  

3 excludes deferred financing costs of 956000  

4 excludes both non–cash net premiums recorded on the mortgages payable of 30 million and deferred financing costs of 13 million at december 31 2019  

5 interest on the term loans notes bonds mortgages payable and credit facility has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december 31 2019 through their respective maturity dates 

6 realty income currently pays the ground lessors directly for the rent under the ground leases 

7 our tenants who are generally subtenants under ground leases are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases in the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent we are primarily responsible 

8  “other” consists of 160 million of commitments under construction contracts and 65 million for releasing costs recurring capital expenditures and nonrecurring building improvements 

  

our credit facility term loans and notes payable obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

  

no unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated investments nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the global credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and global credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly

acquisitions during 2019 

below is a listing of our acquisitions in the us and uk for the year ended december 31 2019 



 

the initial average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the initial average cash lease yield is computed as follows estimated cash net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2019  we had 94 properties available for lease out of 6483 properties in our portfolio which represents a 986 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio 

the following table summarized our leasing results for the year ended december 31 2019 



   

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

 41  

at december 31 2019  our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1488 per square foot on the 6389 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2019  we classified 23 properties with a carrying amount of 968 million as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2019  we capitalized costs of 179 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 21 million for releasing costs 801000 for recurring capital expenditures and 150 million for nonrecurring building improvements in 2018 we capitalized costs of 179 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 39 million for releasing costs 11 million for recurring capital expenditures and 129 million for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and repetitive landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements where we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 51year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2019 and twice in 2020 as of february 2020 we have paid 89 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 105 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 



  

the dividends paid per share during 2019 totaled approximately 27105 as compared to approximately 26305 during 2018 an increase of 008 or 30 

  

the monthly dividend of 02325 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 279 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 38 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 7363 on december 31 2019 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other 

 42  

factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when acquiring a property for investment purposes we typically allocate the cost of real estate acquired inclusive of transaction costs to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their relative estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value and the value of inplace leases as applicable additionally above–market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as financing receivables amortizing over the lease term while below–market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as prepaid rent in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value of the land building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities and is often based upon the various characteristics of the market where the property is located in addition any assumed mortgages are recorded at their estimated fair values the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors such as industry type tenant investment grade maturity date and comparable borrowings for similar assets the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 

  

total revenue 

the following summarizes our total revenue dollars in thousands 



  

rental revenue 

the increase in rental revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily attributable to 



 43  

 

 the increase in rental revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily attributable to 

  

 

 for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were vacant at any time ii were under development or redevelopment or iii were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

of the 6483 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2019  6452  or 995  are singletenant properties and the remaining are multitenant properties of the 6452 singletenant properties 6362  or 986  were net leased at december 31 2019  of our 6362 leased singletenant properties 5456 or 858 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

   

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 80 million in 2019  59 million in 2018 and 61 million in 2017 percentage rent in 2019 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2020 

  

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to commercial tenants under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2019  our portfolio of 6483 properties was 986 leased with 94 properties available for lease as compared to 986 leased with 80 properties available for lease at december 31 2018  it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 

  

rental revenue reimbursable 

a number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses the increase in tenant reimbursements in the years presented is primarily due to the growth of our portfolio from acquisitions 

 44  

other revenue 

the increase in other revenue for 2019 was primarily related to interest income recognized on financing receivables for certain leases with abovemarket terms as compared to 2018 partially offset by lower proceeds from property insurance claims condemnations and interest income from our investments in united states government money market funds 

the increase in other revenue for 2018 was primarily related to higher proceeds from property insurance claims condemnations and interest income from our investments in united states government money market funds as compared to 2017 

total expenses 

the following summarizes our total expenses dollars in thousands 

  

1 general and administrative expenses for 2018 included a one–time severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 283 million however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 18651 and was recorded to general and administrative expense see our discussion of adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders or affo which is not a financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles which includes a reconciliation of this amount in order to present a normalized calculation of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue for 2018 we have excluded this one–time executive severance charge to arrive at a normalized general and administrative amount of 65497 which was used for our calculation 

2 excludes rental revenue reimbursable 

depreciation and amortization 

the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2019 and 2018 which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo” and “adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo 

  

 45  

interest expense 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 



the increase in interest expense from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the october 2018 issuance of our 2500 million senior unsecured term loan the may 2019 issuance of our 2730 notes due 2034 the june 2019 issuance of our 3250 notes due 2029 and a loss on our interest rate swaps in 2019 the increase in interest expense from 2017 to 2018 is primarily due to the april 2018 issuance of our 3875 notes due 2025 this increase was partially offset by the december 2017 early redemption of our 675 notes due 2019 and lower outstanding debt balances on mortgages payable as a result of mortgage payoffs in 2018 

at december 31 2019  the weighted average interest rate on our 

   

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses are expenditures related to the operations of our company including employee–related costs professional fees and other general overhead costs associated with running our business in january 2020 we had 194 employees as compared to 165 employees in january 2019 and 152 employees in january 2018 

the fluctuation of general and administrative costs in 2019 and 2018 is primarily due to the severance charge of 187 million incurred in 2018 and related to our former ceo who departed the company in october 2018 additionally compensation costs in both years increased due to higher headcount 

property expenses excluding reimbursable 

property expenses excluding reimbursable consist of costs associated with unleased properties nonnetleased properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to unleased properties and nonnetleased properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2019 94 properties were available for lease as compared to 80 at december 31 2018 and 83 at december 31 2017 

 46  

the increase in property expenses excluding reimbursable in 2019 is primarily attributable to higher property taxes and maintenance associated with our expanding portfolio size the 2018 decrease was primarily attributable to lower bad debt expense 

property expenses reimbursable 

the increase in property expenses reimbursable in both 2019 and 2018 was primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size which contributed to higher contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses primarily due to our acquisitions in each year 

  

income taxes 

income taxes are for city and state income and franchise taxes and for uk income taxes paid by us and our subsidiaries 

  

provisions for impairment 

the following table summarizes provisions for impairment during the periods indicated below dollars in millions 

other items 

  

gain on sales of real estate 

the following table summarizes our properties sold during the periods indicated below dollars in millions 



at december 31 2019 we classified 23 properties with a carrying amount of 968 million as held for sale on our balance sheet 

foreign currency and derivative gains net 

we borrow in the local currencies of the countries in which we invest foreign currency gains and losses are primarily a result of intercompany debt and certain remeasurement transactions 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in december 2017 we completed the early redemption on all 5500 million of outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a 424 million loss on extinguishment of debt 

preferred stock dividends 

we did not pay any preferred stock dividends in 2019 or 2018 preferred stock dividends totaled 39 million in 2017 additionally in april 2017 we paid a final dividend on our class f preferred stock of 17 million which was recorded to interest expense 

excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

when we issued the irrevocable notice of redemption on our class f preferred stock in march 2017 we incurred a noncash charge of 134 million for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value the noncash charge represents the class f preferred stock original issuance cost that was paid in 2012 

 47  

  

net income available to common stockholders 

the following summarizes our net income available to common stockholders dollars in millions except per share data 



1 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

net income available to common stockholders in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 283 million however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 187 million equivalent to 006 per share 

net income available to common stockholders in 2017 was impacted by a loss of 424 million or 015 per share loss on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all 5500 million in principal amount of our outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 which were redeemed during december 2017 net income was also impacted by a noncash charge of 134 million or 005 per share for the redemption of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that was redeemed in april 2017 this charge is based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that we paid in 2012 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments gains from the sale of properties and foreign currency gains and losses which can vary from period to period based on the timing and significantly impact net income available to the company and available to common stockholders 

adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate adjusted ebitda re  

the national association of real estate investment trust nareit came to the conclusion that a nareitdefined ebitda metric for real estate companies ie ebitda for real estate or ebitdare would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among reits our definition of “adjusted ebitdare” is generally consistent with the nareit definition other than our adjustment to remove foreign currency and derivative gains and losses and the onetime executive severance charge as described below which is consistent with our previous calculations of adjusted ebitdare we define adjusted ebitdare a nongaap financial measure for the most recent quarter as earnings net income before i interest expense including noncash loss gain on swaps ii income and franchise taxes iii real estate depreciation and amortization iv impairment losses v gain on sales of real estate vi foreign currency and derivative gains net and vii executive severance charge as described in the adjusted funds from operations section our adjusted ebitdare may not be comparable to adjusted ebitdare reported by other companies or as defined by nareit and other companies may interpret or define adjusted ebitdare differently than we do management believes adjusted ebitdare to be a meaningful measure of a reit’s performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts lenders and investors management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly adjusted ebitdare metric is meaningful because it represents the company’s current earnings run rate for the period presented the ratio of our total debt to our annualized quarterly adjusted ebitdare is also used to determine vesting of performance share awards granted to our executive officers adjusted ebitdare should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance our ratio of net debttoadjusted ebitdare which is used by management as a measure of leverage is calculated as net debt which we define as total debt per the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents divided by annualized quarterly adjusted ebitdare 

 48  

the following table summarizes our adjusted ebitdare calculation for the periods indicated below 



  

1 interest expense includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of 424 million for the year ended december 31 2017 

2 reflects an 187 million severance charge for our former ceo upon his departure in october 2018 

3 we calculate annualized adjusted ebitda re by multiplying the quarterly adjusted ebitda re by four 

4 during 2019 the definition of net debt adjusted ebitda re was changed to include debt net of cash and cash equivalents under the prior definition debt to adjusted ebitda re was 53 and 55 for the quarters ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

the following summarizes our funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo dollars in millions except per share data 



1 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

our ffo in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 283 million however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 187 million equivalent to 006 per share 

our ffo in 2017 was impacted by a loss of 424 million or 015 per share on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all 5500 million of our outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 during december 2017 ffo in 2017 was also impacted by a noncash redemption charge of 134 million or 005 per share upon the redemption of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that was redeemed in april 2017 this charge is based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that we paid in 2012 

  

 49  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 



  

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets and reduced by gains on property sales 

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

the following summarizes our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo dollars in millions except per share data 



1 all per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis 

 50  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

1 see reconciling items for ffo presented under “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo” 

2 the executive severance charge represents the incremental costs incurred upon our former ceos departure in october 2018 per the reconciliation below 



3 includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized upon issuance of our notes payable assumption of our mortgages payable and upon issuance of our term loans the deferred financing costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages and term loans no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

4 straightline payments from crosscurrency swaps represent quarterly payments in us dollars received by us from counterparties in exchange for associated foreign currency payments these usd payments are fixed and determinable for the duration of the associated hedging transaction 

5 includes adjustments allocable to noncontrolling interests obligations related to financing lease liabilities and foreign currency gains and losses as a result of intercompany debt and remeasurement transactions

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

  

presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity our ability to make cash distributions or our ability to pay interest payments 

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings or fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

moreover our use of net lease agreements tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the tenant is responsible for property expenses inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue

for information on the impact of newly adopted accounting standards on our business see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility term loans mortgages payable and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

  

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2019 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  expected maturity data 



1 excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable net original issuance premiums recorded on notes payable and deferred financing costs on mortgages payable notes payable and term loans at december 31 2019 the unamortized balance of net premiums on mortgages payable is 30 million  the unamortized balance of net original issuance premiums on notes payable is 63 million  and the balance of deferred financing costs on mortgages payable is 13 million  on notes payable is 359 million  and on term loans is 956000  

2 we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes and bonds at december 31 2019 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at december 31 2019 on the relevant forward interest rate curve plus an applicable creditadjusted spread we believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance and term loans balance reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at december 31 2019 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2019 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates at december 31 2019 all of our mortgages payable had fixed interest rates except one variable rate mortgage on one property totaling 71 million  which has been swapped to a fixed interest rate interest on our credit facility and term loan balances is variable however the variable interest rate feature on our term loans has been mitigated by interest rate swap agreements based on our credit facility balance of 7043 million at december 31 2019 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest rate costs by 70 million per year 

during the second quarter of 2019 we commenced foreign operations and acquired real property in the uk as a result we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the great british pound sterling relative to the us dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in the uk we mitigate these foreign currency exposures with non–us denominated borrowings and cross–currency swaps  if we increase our international presence through investments in properties outside the us we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than us dollars

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2019 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal controlintegrated framework 2013” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting

changes in internal controls 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

recent developments 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 50year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2018 and twice during 2019 as of february 2019 we have paid 85 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 100 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 



  

the dividends paid per share during 2018 totaled approximately 26305 as compared to approximately 25270 during 2017 an increase of 01035 or 41 

  

the monthly dividend of 02255 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2706 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 43 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 6304 on december 31 2018 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

acquisitions during 2018 

during 2018  we invested 18 billion  in 764  new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 64  the 764  new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 39  states will contain approximately 52 million  leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 148 years  the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 21  industries and the property types are 963  retail and 37  industrial based on rental revenue during 2018  none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2018  

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated cash net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 18 billion  we invested during 2018  803 million  was invested in 14  properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 69  we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2018  we had 80  properties available for lease out of 5797  properties in our portfolio which represents a 986  occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio since december 31 2017 when we reported 83  properties available for lease out of 5172  and a 984  occupancy rate we 

  

   

of the 228  properties released during 2018  215  properties were released to existing tenants three  were released to new tenants without vacancy and ten  were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 228  leases was 4615 million  as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 4466 million  which represents a rent recapture rate of 1033  on the properties released during 2018  

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

at december 31 2018  our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1424  per square foot on the 5717  leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2018  we classified 17  properties with a carrying amount of 166 million  as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2018  we capitalized costs of 179 million  on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 39 million  for releasing costs 11 million  for recurring capital expenditures and 129 million  for nonrecurring building improvements in 2017 we capitalized costs of 127 million  on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 16 million  for releasing costs 912000  for recurring capital expenditures and 102 million  for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and repetitive landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements where we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties 

sumit roy appointed chief executive officer ceo 

on october 16 2018 we announced that our board of directors had appointed sumit roy to the position of our ceo and to our board of directors mr roy who previously served as chief operating officer succeeds john p case our previous ceo mr roy continues to serve as our president 

tau operating partnership buyout and term loan payoff 

in january 2019 we redeemed all of the outstanding 317022 common units of tau operating partnership lp which reduced our total common units outstanding to 373797 as of january 3 2019 additionally in january 2019 we paid off the outstanding balance and interest on the 700 million senior unsecured term loan entered in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct following the redemption we hold 100 of the ownership interests of tau operating partnership lp and continue to consolidate the entity 

new expanded credit facility 

in october 2018 we entered into a new 325 billion unsecured credit facility to replace our previous 225 billion unsecured credit facility of which 20 billion was due to expire in june 2019 this new credit facility includes a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a new 2500 million unsecured term loan due march 2024 the new revolving credit facility matures in march 2023 and includes two sixmonth extensions that can be exercised at our 

  4  

option the new revolving credit facility or our revolving credit facility also has a 10 billion expansion feature as of december 31 2018  we had a balance of 2520 million  on our credit facility under our revolving credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at libor plus 0775 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 090 over libor our previous 225 billion unsecured credit facility had allin drawn pricing of 0975 over libor 

in conjunction with our new revolving credit facility we entered into a new 2500 million senior unsecured term loan which matures in march 2024 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current onemonth libor plus 085 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest on this term loan at 389 

sp upgrade to a 

in august 2018 sp global ratings raised our credit rating to a with a stable outlook from bbb with a positive outlook 

  

note issuance 

in april 2018 we issued 5000 million  of 3875  senior unsecured notes due 2025 or the 2025 notes the public offering price for the 2025 notes was 9950  of the principal amount for an effective yield to maturity of 3957  the net proceeds of approximately 4931 million  from this offering were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility to fund investment opportunities and for other general corporate purposes 

  

capital raising 

during 2018  we raised 11 billion  from the sale of common stock primarily through the use of our atthemarket atm programs at a weighted average price of 5877  per share 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 3636 million  in 2018  as compared to 3015 million in 2017 an increase of 621 million  on a diluted per common share basis net income was 126  in 2018  as compared to 110 in 2017 an increase of 016  or 145  

net income available to common stockholders in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 283 million however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 187 million equivalent to 006 per share 

net income and funds from operations available to common stockholders per share in 2017 were impacted by a loss of 424 million or 015 per share on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all 5500 million of our outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 during december 2017 net income and funds from operations available to common stockholders for 2017 were also impacted by a 134 million noncash redemption charge on the shares of class f preferred stock that were redeemed in april 2017 which represented 005 on a diluted per common share basis this charge was based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class f preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2012 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments and gains from the sale of properties which can vary from period to period based on the timing and significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

in 2018  our ffo increased by 1306 million  or 169  to 9033 million  as compared to 7727 million  in 2017 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 312  in 2018  as compared to 282  in 2017 an increase of 030  or 106  

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

in 2018  our affo increased by 860 million  or 103  to 9246 million  as compared to 8386 million  in 2017 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 319  in 2018  as compared to 306  in 2017 an increase of 013  or 42  

  

see our discussion of ffo and affo which are not financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles or gaap later in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition

and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and affo 

  

dividend policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock 

  

distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of realty income lp each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders prior to the redemption of our common units of tau operating partnership lp in january 2019 distributions were paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of tau operating partnership lp each on a per unit basis that was generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders 

in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2018 our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 7616 million or approximately 1335 of our estimated taxable income of 5704 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our cash distributions to common stockholders in 2018 totaled 7616 million representing 824 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 9246 million  in comparison our 2017 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 6893 million  representing 822 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 8386 million  

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year however noncorporate stockholders including individuals generally may deduct up to 20 of dividends from a reit other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 

  

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 229 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2018 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we estimate that in 2019 between 15 and 25 of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital

business philosophy and strategy 

  

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of primarily singletenant commercial properties under longterm net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income a net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on 1 increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 2 fixed increases or 3 additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm net lease agreements generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy we believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant industry geography and to a certain extent property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio that as of december 31 2018 consisted of 5797  properties located in 49  states and puerto rico leased to 262  different commercial tenants doing business in 48  industries each of the 48 industries represented in our property portfolio accounted for no more than 124  of our rental revenue during either the quarter or year ended december 31 2018  

  

investment strategy 

when identifying new properties for investment we generally focus on acquiring highquality real estate that tenants consider important to the successful operation of their business we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

  

   

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized tenants are capturing market share through the selection of prime real estate locations supported by superior service quality control economies of scale consumer branding and advertising in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of singletenant properties net leased to different tenants operating in a variety of industries we have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities often using our relationships with various tenants ownersdevelopers brokers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions we also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations tenants and industries for investment this research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value 

  

in selecting potential investments we look for tenants with the following attributes 

  

   

from a retail perspective our investment strategy is to target tenants that have a service nondiscretionary andor lowpricepoint component to their business we believe these characteristics better position tenants to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers as a result of the execution of this strategy approximately 95 of our annualized retail rental revenue at december 31 2018 is derived from tenants with a service nondiscretionary andor low price point component to their business from a nonretail perspective we target industrial properties leased to industry leaders that are primarily investment grade rated 

  7  

companies we believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties 

  

after applying this investment strategy we pursue those transactions where we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable riskadjusted returns we will continue to evaluate all investments consistent with our objective of owning net lease assets 

  

underwriting strategy 

in order to be considered for acquisition properties must meet stringent underwriting requirements we have established a fourpart analysis to examine each potential investment based on 

  

 

we believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligation is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive therefore in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property 

  

thus as the property owner we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition 

  

prior to entering into any transaction our research department conducts a review of a tenant’s credit quality the information reviewed may include reports and filings including any public credit ratings financial statements debt and equity analyst reports and reviews of corporate credit spreads stock prices market capitalization and other financial metrics we conduct additional due diligence including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates we continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed and providing summaries of these findings to management approximately 51  of our annualized rental revenue comes from properties leased to investment grade rated companies or their subsidiaries at december 31 2018  our top 20 tenants represented approximately 54  of our annualized revenue and 12  of these tenants have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries of investment grade companies 

  

portfolio and asset management strategy 

in addition to pursuing new properties for investment we seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio and asset management 

  

generally our portfolio and asset management efforts seek to achieve 

  

   

we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our tenants our tenants’ industries and the real estate locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a 

  8  

view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality our active portfolio and asset management strategy pursues asset sales when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

   

at december 31 2018  we classified 17  properties with a carrying amount of 166 million  as held for sale on our balance sheet for 2019 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate 75 to 100 million in property sales we plan to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during 2019 at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

the active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy of maintaining high occupancy since 1970 our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 however we cannot assure you that our future occupancy levels will continue to equal or exceed 96 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities property sales borrowing on our credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2018  our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 65 billion  or approximately 254  of our total market capitalization of 257 billion  

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2018  as the sum of 

  

   

in january 2019 we redeemed all of our outstanding 317022 common units of tau operating partnership lp which reduced our total common units outstanding to 373797 as of january 3 2019

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

universal shelf registration 

in november 2018 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in november 2021 in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

revolving credit facility 

in october 2018 we entered into a new 325 billion unsecured credit facility to replace our previous 225 billion unsecured credit facility of which 20 billion was due to expire in june 2019 this new credit facility includes a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a new 2500 million unsecured term loan due march 2024 the new revolving credit facility or our revolving credit facility matures in march 2023 and includes two sixmonth extensions that can be exercised at our option our revolving credit facility also has a 10 billion expansion feature under our new revolving credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at libor plus 0775 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 090 over libor 

the borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings change we also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility our revolving credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2018  we had a borrowing capacity of 275 billion  available on our revolving credit facility and an outstanding balance of 2520 million  the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december 31 2018  was 32  per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2018  we were in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms 

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 104 million  

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies as of december 31 2018  we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of a3 with a “stable” outlook 

  10  

standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of a with a “stable” outlook and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our ratings as of december 31 2018  the facility interest rate was libor plus 0775 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 090 over libor our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 145 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 075 if our credit rating is aa2 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 030 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 010 for a credit rating of aa2 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

term loans 

in october 2018 in conjunction with our revolving credit facility we entered into a new 2500 million senior unsecured term loan which matures in march 2024 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current onemonth libor plus 085 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest on this term loan at 389

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

this “risk factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders” unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock 

in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

  we face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties we expect competition from 

  



  20  

   

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

  cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

  

   

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us 

  

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a tenant for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness 

as of december 31 2018  80  of our properties were available for lease or sale of which 77 were singletenant properties at december 31 2018  69 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2018 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

for 2018  our tenants in the “convenience store” industry accounted for approximately 112 of our rental revenue while our tenants in the drug store industry accounted for approximately 102 of our rental revenue for the same period a downturn in these industries could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of 

  21  

operations our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock including the common stock offered hereby and preferred stock 

  

individually   each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2018  nevertheless downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock 

  

in addition some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have limited financial and other resources and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional national or international economy 

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

   

there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings with asbestos in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation andor that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of tenants’ activities on the properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements obtaining environmental insurance or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation however it is possible that one or more of our tenants could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable 

  22  

state financial assurance obligations and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities 

  

compliance   we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

  

insurance and indemnity   in march 2018 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in march 2028 and replaced our previous tenyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 60 million in the aggregate the limits on the excess policy are 5 million per occurrence and 10 million in the aggregate therefore the primary and excess tenyear policies together provide a total limit of 15 million per occurrence and 70 million in the aggregate 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

   

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  23  

  

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our investors 

the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue services or the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect us or our investors including holders of our common stock or debt securities we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

  

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act or tcja has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders we are continuing to assess the potential impact of tcja on us as related regulations are proposed and finalized the changes made by tcja that could affect us and our investors include 

  

 

many of these changes were effective on january 1 2018 without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is still unclear in some respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation in addition state and local tax jurisdictions which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities are continuing to evaluate the legislation to determine their respective levels of conformity to the new law while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us 

  

distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect 

  24  

of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that under certain circumstances may be exchanged for shares of our common stock this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of or refinance the debt on the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain similarly we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

  

we are subject   to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the   future including the use of our unsecured revolving credit facility which has a borrowing capacity of 30 billion  at december 31 2018  we had 2520 million  of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility a total of 54 billion  of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of 105 million  and deferred financing costs of 337 million  5700 million  of borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured term loans excluding deferred financing costs of 14 million  and approximately 2984 million  of outstanding mortgage debt excluding net unamortized premiums totaling 44 million  and deferred financing costs of 183000  on this mortgage debt to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility our term loans and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and the recent global financial crisis and related uncertainties including the impact of the united kingdom’s advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union referred to as brexit we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

  

in addition our revolving credit facility our term loan facilities and mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our revolving credit facility and our two 2500 million term loan facilities all of which are governed by the same credit agreement provide that if an event of default as defined in the credit agreement exists neither we nor any of our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may pay any dividends or other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

  



  25  

  

except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock the credit agreement further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement we and our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or other distributions on except for a distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and b dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under the credit agreement were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness or prevent us from paying those dividends other distributions interest or principal altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit 

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities including 

  

   

if we default under a credit facility loan agreement or other debt instrument the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and in the case of secured indebtedness to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral 

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors   which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control including 

  

   

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the united states or us trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors 

  26  

investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

   

real estate property investments are illiquid therefore the company may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

we are engaged in the process of identifying analyzing underwriting and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions 

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant net lease locations we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and properties leased to tenants engaged in nonretail businesses including risks resulting from our limited experience in managing underwriting and assessing risks related to such properties or understanding the market dynamics applicable to such properties tenants or lease structures any of which could also have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

  27  

if we acquire properties outside of the united states we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations 

we may make selected acquisitions of properties outside of the united states in which case we may be exposed to a variety of new risks such as 

 

if we are unable to adequately address these risks they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our 

results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

in addition although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects such as claims of ownership liens or other encumbrances there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property cause a financial misstatement or lead to reputational damage to the company 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally 

  28  

requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

litigation risks could affect our business 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

  

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry 

  

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our tenants our business or the united states generally 

if events like these were to occur they could materially interrupt our business operations cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and maintenance of records which may include personal identifying information although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the theft of intellectual property personal information or personal property such as in the event of cyberattacks any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations result in theft of company assets damage our reputation subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  29  

in addition we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system in 2018 we may experience difficulties with this system which could potentially result in disruption to our normal accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting inaccuracies in the conversion of electronic data difficulties integrating the systems and processes additional costs to continue to refine the system’s functionality and disruption of our financial reporting process 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last several years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably in addition recent global financial crises such as concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar effect these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing unrest in certain middle eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

  

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our internal controls over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and disclosures our reit qualification being jeopardized impairment in the company’s access to capital civil litigation or investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which may adversely impact our financial condition   and results of operations 

  

  30  

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms 

campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company if we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future our business could be adversely affected as such activities could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties tenants and financing sources and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or existing sellers of properties tenants or financing sources choose to delay defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues then our results of operations could be adversely affected similarly we may suffer damage to our reputation for example regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities including the notes resulting in significant loss of value which could impact our ability to access capital increase our cost of capital and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms 

  

our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock 

our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to among other purposes assist us in maintaining our status as a reit for united states federal andor state income tax purposes for example our charter restricts any person from acquiring actual or constructive ownership of more than 98 in value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock these restrictions could have antitakeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

the value of certain of our investment in real property may be reduced as the result of the expiration or loss of local tax abatements tax credit programs or other governmental incentives 

certain of our investments have the benefit of governmental tax incentives aimed at inducing retail users to relocate to incentivize development in areas and neighborhoods which have not historically seen robust commercial development the tax cuts and jobs act provided for such communities to be designated as qualified opportunity zones which are eligible for such tax benefits these incentives typically have specific sunset provisions and may be subject to governmental discretion in the eligibility or award of the applicable incentives the expiration of these incentive programs or the inability of potential tenants or users to be eligible for or to obtain governmental approval of the incentives or the inability to remain compliant with such programs may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment cash flow and net income and may result in impairment charges

liquidity and capital resources 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2018  our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 65 billion  or approximately 254  of our total market capitalization of 257 billion  

  34  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2018  as the sum of 

  

 

in january 2019 we redeemed all of our outstanding 317022 common units of tau operating partnership lp which reduced our total common units outstanding to 373797 as of january 3 2019 additionally in january 2019 we paid off the outstanding balance and interest on the 700 million senior unsecured term loan entered in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct following the redemption we hold 100 of the ownership interests of tau operating partnership lp and continue to consolidate the entity 

universal shelf registration 

in november 2018 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in november 2021 in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

  

atthemarket atm programs 

in november 2018 following the issuance and sale of 25038145 shares under our prior atm equity distribution plans or our prior atm programs we established a new atm equity distribution plan or our new atm program pursuant to which up to 28961855 additional shares of common stock may be offered and sold 1 by us to or through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or 2 by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers contemplated thereunder in each case by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the nyse at prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices during 2018 we issued 19138610  shares and raised gross proceeds of 11 billion  under our new and prior atm programs from the inception of our new and prior atm programs through december 31 2018  we have issued 33546139  shares and raised 20 billion  

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or our drspp provides our common stockholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions our drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions our drspp authorizes up to 26000000  common shares to be issued our drspp includes a waiver approval process allowing larger investors or institutions per a formal approval process to purchase shares at a small discount if approved by us during 2018  we issued 166268  shares and raised approximately 91 million  under our drspp we did not issue shares under the waiver approval process during 2018  from the inception of our drspp through december 31 2018  we have issued 14229810  shares and raised approximately 6709 million  

  

revolving credit facility 

in october 2018 we entered into a new 325 billion unsecured credit facility to replace our previous 225 billion unsecured credit facility of which 20 billion was due to expire in june 2019 this new credit facility includes a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a new 2500 million unsecured term loan due march 2024 the new revolving credit facility or our revolving credit facility matures in march 2023 and includes two sixmonth extensions that can be exercised at our option our revolving credit facility also has a 10 billion expansion feature under our 

  35  

revolving credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at libor plus 0775 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 090 over libor 

the borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings change we also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility our revolving credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2018  we had a borrowing capacity of 275 billion  available on our revolving credit facility and an outstanding balance of 2520 million  the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december 31 2018  was 32  per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2018  we were in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms 

  

term loans 

in october 2018 in conjunction with our revolving credit facility we entered into a new 2500 million senior unsecured term loan which matures in march 2024 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current onemonth libor plus 085 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest on this term loan at 389 

in december 2017 in conjunction with the acquisition of a portfolio of properties we entered into a 1259 million promissory note which was paid in full at maturity in january 2018 borrowings under this note bore interest at 152 

in june 2015 in conjunction with entering into our previous credit facility we entered into a 2500 million senior unsecured term loan maturing june 2020 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current onemonth libor plus 090 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 262 

  

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of american realty capital trust inc or arct we entered into a 700 million senior unsecured term loan with an initial maturity date of january 2018 borrowing under this term loan bore interest at the current onemonth libor plus 110 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which until its termination in january 2018 effectively fixed our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 205 in 2018 we entered into two separate six–month extensions of this loan during which periods the interest was born at the current one–month libor plus 090 in january 2019 we paid off the outstanding principal and interest on this term loan 

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2018  we had 2984 million  of mortgages payable all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions additionally at december 31 2018  we had net premiums totaling 44 million  on these mortgages and deferred financing costs of 183000  we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that would make it economically feasible to do so during 2018 we made 219 million  of principal payments including the repayment of two  mortgages in full for 170 million

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2018  sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 



  

in january 2018 we repaid our 3500 million of outstanding 2000 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest upon maturity in april 2018 we issued 5000 million  of 3875  senior unsecured notes due 2025 or the 2025 notes the public offering price for the 2025 notes was 9950  of the principal amount for an effective yield to maturity of 3957  the net proceeds of approximately 4931 million  from this offering were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility to fund investment opportunities and for other general corporate purposes 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants with which we remained in compliance as of december 31 2018  additionally interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 

  

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds these calculations which are not based on us gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2018  are 



  1 our debt service coverage ratio is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding fourquarter period on the assumptions that i the incurrence of any debt as defined in the covenants incurred by us since the first day of such fourquarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom including to refinance other debt since the first day of such fourquarter period ii the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such fourquarter period and iii any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on january 1 2018 and subject to certain additional adjustments such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses i ii and iii of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1 2018 nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period our fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in the same manner as our debt service coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator since we redeemed our class f preferred dividends in april 2017 our fixed charge coverage ratio is equivalent to our debt service coverage ratio the following is our calculation of debt service and fixed charge coverage at december 31 2018 in thousands for trailing twelve months

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 104 million  

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies as of december 31 2018  we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of a3 with a “stable” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of a with a “stable” outlook and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our ratings as of december 31 2018  the facility interest rate was libor plus 0775 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 090 over libor our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 145 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 075 if our credit rating is aa2 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 030 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 010 for a credit rating of aa2 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

table of obligations 

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2018  dollars in millions 



  

1 the initial term of the credit facility expires in march 2023 and includes at our option two six–month extensions 

2 excludes both non–cash original issuance discounts and premiums recorded on notes payable of 105 million  and deferred financing costs of 337 million  at december 31 2018  

3 excludes deferred financing costs of 14 million  in january 2019 we repaid the outstanding principal and interest on the 700 million senior unsecured term loan we entered into in conjunction with our acquisition of arct in january 2013 

4 excludes both non–cash net premiums recorded on the mortgages payable of 44 million  and deferred financing costs of 183000  at december 31 2018  

5   interest on the term loans notes bonds mortgages payable and credit facility has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december 31 2018  through their respective maturity dates 

6 realty income currently pays the ground lessors directly for the rent under the ground leases 

7 our tenants who are generally subtenants under ground leases are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases in the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent we are primarily responsible 

8  “other” consists of 236 million  of commitments under construction contracts and 58 million  of commitments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 

  

our credit facility term loans and notes payable obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

  38  

  

no unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated investments nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

acquisitions during 2018 

during 2018  we invested 18 billion  in 764  new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 64  the 764  new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 39  states will contain approximately 52 million  leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 148 years  the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 21  industries and the property types are 963  retail and 37  industrial based on rental revenue during 2018  none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2018  

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated cash net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 18 billion  we invested during 2018  803 million  was invested in 14  properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 69  we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2018  we had 80  properties available for lease out of 5797  properties in our portfolio which represents a 986  occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio since december 31 2017 when we reported 83  properties available for lease out of 5172  and a 984  occupancy rate we 

  

   

of the 228  properties released during 2018  215  properties were released to existing tenants three  were released to new tenants without vacancy and ten  were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 228  leases was 4615 million  as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 4466 million  which represents a rent recapture rate of 1033  on the properties released during 2018  

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

at december 31 2018  our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1424  per square foot on the 5717  leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2018  we classified 17  properties with a carrying amount of 166 million  as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a 

  39  

strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2018  we capitalized costs of 179 million  on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 39 million  for releasing costs 11 million  for recurring capital expenditures and 129 million  for nonrecurring building improvements in 2017 we capitalized costs of 127 million  on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 16 million  for releasing costs 912000  for recurring capital expenditures and 102 million  for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and repetitive landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements where we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 50year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2018 and twice in 2019 as of february 2019 we have paid 85 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 100 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 



  

the dividends paid per share during 2018 totaled approximately 26305 as compared to approximately 25270 during 2017 an increase of 01035 or 41 

  

the monthly dividend of 02255 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2706 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 43 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 6304 on december 31 2018 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  40  

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when acquiring a property for investment purposes we typically allocate the cost of real estate acquired inclusive of transaction costs to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their relative estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value and the value of inplace leases as applicable in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the market where the property is located in addition any assumed mortgages receivable or payable are recorded at their estimated fair values the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors such as industry type tenant investment grade maturity date and comparable borrowings for similar assets the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods historical sales and releases capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

  

total revenue 

the following summarizes our total revenue dollars in thousands 



  

rental revenue 

the increase in rental revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily attributable to 

 



  41  

 the increase in rental revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to 

  

 

 for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were vacant at any time ii were under development or redevelopment or iii were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

of the 5797  properties in the portfolio at december 31 2018  5769  or 995  are singletenant properties and the remaining are multitenant properties of the 5769  singletenant properties 5692  or 987  were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 92 years at december 31 2018  of our 5692  leased singletenant properties 4952  or 870  were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

   

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 59 million  in 2018  61 million in 2017 and 53 million in 2016 percentage rent in 2018  was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2019 

  

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to regional and national tenants under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2018  our portfolio of 5797  properties was 986  leased with 80  properties available for lease as compared to 984  leased with 83  properties available for lease at december 31 2017  it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 

  

tenant reimbursements 

a number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses the increase in tenant reimbursements in the years presented is primarily due to our increase in acquisitions 

other revenue 

the increase in other revenue in the years presented was primarily related to higher proceeds from property insurance claims condemnations and interest income from our investments in united states government money market funds 

  42  

total expenses 

the following summarizes our total expenses dollars in thousands 

  

   

depreciation and amortization 

the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2017 and 2018 which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo” and “adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo 

  

interest expense 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 



  

  43  

the increases in interest expense for the years presented are primarily due to the issuances of notes in each respective year these increases were partially offset by note redemptions in each respective year and lower outstanding debt balances on mortgages payable as a result of mortgage payoffs in 2018 and 2017 

  

additionally before we implemented hedge accounting in the fourth quarter of 2018 we adjusted the carrying value of our interest rate swaps to fair value each quarter through interest expense following the adoption of hedge accounting we record this change in fair value within other comprehensive income 

at december 31 2018  the weighted average interest rate on our 

   

in january 2019 we paid off the outstanding balance and interest on the 700 million senior unsecured term loan entered in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased during 2018 primarily due to a severance charge of 187 million for our former ceo who departed the company in october 2018 and higher corporate–level professional fees general and administrative expenses in both 2018 and 2017 increased due to higher compensation costs related to higher headcount in january 2019 we had 165  employees as compared to 152 employees in january 2018 and 146 employees in january 2017 

property expenses excluding reimbursable 

property expenses excluding reimbursable consist of costs associated with unleased properties nonnetleased properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to unleased properties and nonnetleased properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2018 80  properties were available for lease as compared to 83  at december 31 2017 and 84  at december 31 2016 

the 2018 decrease in property expenses excluding reimbursable was primarily attributable to lower bad debt expense while the 2017 increase was the result of higher property taxes and bad debt expense 

property expenses reimbursable 

the increase in property expenses reimbursable in both 2018 and 2017 was primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size which contributed to higher contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses primarily due to our acquisitions in each year 

  

income taxes 

income taxes are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by us and our subsidiaries these taxes from operations increased from 2017 to 2018 due to acquisitions however the overall tax expense decreased due to a onetime charge in 2017 that increased tax expenses at the end of 2017 the tax cuts  jobs act passed at the end of 2017 reduced the corporate tax rate which reduced the value of the deferred tax assets in 2017 and increased our tax expense in 2017 the increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to increased activity in our taxable reit subsidiary 

  

provisions for impairment 

in 2018 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 263 million  on six  properties classified as held for sale three  properties classified as held for investment and 35  sold properties in 2017 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 148 million  on one  property classified as held for sale three  properties classified as held for investment and 22  sold properties in 2016 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 207 million  on one property classified as held for sale and 38  sold properties 

  44  

  

other items 

  

gain on sales of real estate 

during 2018 we sold 128  properties for 1423 million  which resulted in a gain of 246 million  

  

during 2017 we sold 59 properties for 1670 million which resulted in a gain of 409 million 

  

during   2016 we sold 77 properties for 905 million which resulted in a gain of 220 million additionally during 2016 we sold our former corporate headquarters building for 86 million 

at december 31 2018 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 166 million  as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2019 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate 75 to 100 million in yet to be identified property sales for all of 2019 we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in december 2017 we completed the early redemption on all 5500 million of outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a 424 million loss on extinguishment of debt which represents 015 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

preferred stock dividends 

we did not pay any preferred stock dividends in 2018 preferred stock dividends totaled 39 million in 2017 additionally in april 2017 we paid a final dividend on our class f preferred stock of 17 million which was recorded to interest expense preferred stock dividends totaled 271 million in 2016 

excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

when we issued the irrevocable notice of redemption on our class f preferred stock in march 2017 we incurred a noncash charge of 134 million for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value the noncash charge represents the class f preferred stock original issuance cost that was paid in 2012 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 3636 million  in 2018 compared to 3015 million  in 2017 an increase of 621 million  on a diluted per common share basis net income was 126  in 2018 as compared to 110  in 2017 an increase of 016  or 145  net income available to common stockholders was 2885 million in 2016 or 113 on a diluted per common share basis 

net income available to common stockholders in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 283 million however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 187 million equivalent to 006 per share 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments and gains from the sale of properties which can vary from period to period based on the timing and significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate adjusted ebitda re  

the national association of real estate investment trust nareit came to the conclusion that a nareitdefined ebitda metric for real estate companies ie ebitda for real estate or ebitdare would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among reits we have relabeled our adjusted ebitda to “adjusted ebitdare” in order to be consistent with the nareit definition other than the onetime executive severance charge described below we define adjusted ebitdare a nongaap financial measure for the most recent quarter as earnings net income before i interest expense including noncash gain on swaps ii income and franchise taxes iii real estate depreciation and amortization iv impairment losses v gain on sales of real estate and vi executive severance charge as described in the adjusted funds from operations section our adjusted ebitdare may not be comparable to adjusted ebitdare reported by other companies or as defined by 

  45  

nareit and other companies may interpret or define adjusted ebitdare differently than we do management believes adjusted ebitdare to be a meaningful measure of a reit’s performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts lenders and investors management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly adjusted ebitdare metric is meaningful because it represents the company’s current earnings run rate for the period presented the ratio of our total debt to our annualized quarterly adjusted ebitdare is also used to determine vesting of performance share awards granted to our executive officers adjusted ebitdare should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance our ratio of debt to adjusted ebitdare which is used by management as a measure of leverage is calculated by annualizing quarterly adjusted ebitdare and then dividing by our total debt per the consolidated balance sheet 

  

  

1 interest expense includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of 424 million for the year ended december 31 2017 

2 reflects an 187 million severance charge for our former ceo upon his departure in october 2018 

3 we calculate annualized adjusted ebitda re  by multiplying the quarterly adjusted ebitda re  by four 

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

  

in 2018 our ffo increased by 1306 million  or 169  to 9033 million  as compared to 7727 million  in 2017 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 312  in 2018 as compared to 282  in 2017 an increase of 030  or 106  in 2016 ffo was 7354 million or 288 on a diluted per common share basis our ffo in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former ceo in october 2018 the total value of cash stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 283 million however the net amount after incorporating accruals for ceo compensation previous to this severance was 187 million equivalent to 006 per share our ffo in 2017 was impacted by a loss of 424 million or 015 per share on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all 5500 million of our outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 during december 2017 ffo was also impacted by a noncash redemption charge of 134 million or 005 per share upon the redemption of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that was redeemed in april 2017 this charge is based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that we paid in 2012 ffo for 2017 also includes the early redemption on all 5500 million of our outstanding 675 notes due august 15 2019 plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  46  



  

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets and reduced by gains on property sales 

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility

in 2018 our affo increased by 860 million  or 103  to 9246 million  as compared to 8386 million  in 2017 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 319  in 2018 as compared to 306  in 2017 an increase of 013  or 42  in 2016 affo was 7364 million or 288 on a diluted per common share basis we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term “cad” for cash available for distribution “fad” for funds available for distribution or other terms 

  47  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts

2 the executive severance charge represents the incremental costs incurred upon our former ceos departure in october 2018 per the reconciliation below 



3   includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized upon issuance of our notes payable assumption of our mortgages payable and upon issuance of our term loans the deferred financing costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages and term loans no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

4   includes adjustments allocable to both noncontrolling interests and capital lease obligations 

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

  

  48  

presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity our ability to make cash distributions or our ability to pay interest payments 

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings or fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

moreover our use of net lease agreements tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the tenant is responsible for property expenses inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility term loans mortgages payable and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

  

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2018 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  

  49  

expected maturity data 



1 excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable net original issuance premiums recorded on notes payable and deferred financing costs on mortgages payable notes payable and term loans at december 31 2018 the unamortized balance of net premiums on mortgages payable is 44 million  the unamortized balance of net original issuance premiums on notes payable is 105 million  and the balance of deferred financing costs on mortgages payable is 183000  on notes payable is 337 million  and on term loans is 14 million  

2 we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes and bonds at december 31 2018 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at december 31 2018 on the relevant forward interest rate curve plus an applicable creditadjusted spread we believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance and term loans balance reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at december 31 2018 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2018 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates all of our mortgages payable except two  mortgages with principal balances totaling 233 million  at december 31 2018 have fixed interest rates after factoring in arrangements that limit our exposure to interest rate risk and effectively fix our per annum interest rates our mortgage debt subject to variable rates totals 160 million  at december 31 2018 interest on our credit facility and term loan balances is variable however the variable interest rate feature on our term loans has been mitigated by interest rate swap agreements based on our credit facility balance of 2520 million  at december 31 2018 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest rate costs by 25 million per year 




 item 9     changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a     controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that   information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal controlintegrated framework 2013” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting

changes in internal controls 

in january 2018 we implemented an enterprise resource planning system and accordingly we have updated our internal controls over financial reporting as necessary to accommodate modifications to our business processes and to take advantage of enhanced automated controls provided by the new system there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2018 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

at december 31 2017 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

·   of 5172 properties 

·   with an occupancy rate of 984 or 5089 properties leased and 83 properties available for lease

recent developments 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 49year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2017 and twice during 2018 as of february 2018 we have paid 81 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 95 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 

  

   

the dividends paid per share during 2017 totaled approximately 2527 as compared to approximately 2392 during 2016 an increase of 0135 or 56 

  

the monthly dividend of 0219 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2628 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 46 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 5702 on december 31 2017 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

acquisitions during 2017 

during 2017 we invested 152 billion in 303 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 64 the 303 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states will contain approximately 78 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 144 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 23 industries and the property types are 945 retail and 55 industrial based on rental revenue during 2017 none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2017 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 152 billion we invested during 2017 212 million was invested in 17 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 69 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2017 we had 83 properties available for lease out of 5172 properties in our portfolio which represents a 984 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio since december 31 2016 when we reported 84 properties available for lease out of 4944 and a 983 occupancy rate we 

  

·   had 297 lease expirations 

·   released 259 properties and 

·   sold 39 vacant properties 

  

of the 259 properties released during 2017 235 properties were released to existing tenants nine were released to new tenants without vacancy and 15 were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 259 leases was 4318 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 4092 million which represents a rent recapture rate of 1055 on the properties released during 2017 

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

at december 31 2017 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1377 per square foot on the 5089 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2017 we classified nine properties with a carrying amount of 67 million as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2017 we capitalized costs of 127 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 16 million for releasing costs 912000 for recurring capital expenditures and 102 million for nonrecurring building improvements in 2016 we capitalized costs of 163 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 797000 for releasing costs 679000 for recurring capital expenditures and 149 million for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and repetitive landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements where we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the property 

  

note issuance 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we issued the following notes dollars in millions 

  

   

 4  

  

the net proceeds of 13 billion from the december 2017 note offerings were used to redeem all 5500 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2019 notes including accrued and unpaid interest and to repay borrowings outstanding under our 20 billion revolving credit facility and to the extent not used for those purposes to fund the development and acquisitions of additional properties and for other general corporate purposes the net proceeds of 7052 million from the march 2017 note offerings were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility to fund investment opportunities and for other general corporate purposes 

  

capital raising 

during 2017 realty income issued 23957741 common shares at a weighted average price of 5954 receiving gross proceeds of 14 billion 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 3015 million in 2017 as compared to 2885 million in 2016 an increase of 130 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 110 in 2017 as compared to 113 in 2016 a decrease of 003 or 27 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments gains from the sale of properties andor fair value adjustments on our interest rate swaps these items vary from period to period based on the timing of property sales and the interest rate environment and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

in 2017 our ffo increased by 373 million or 51 to 7727 million as compared to 7354 million in 2016 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 282 in 2017 as compared to 288 in 2016 a decrease of 006 or 21 

  

net income and funds from operations available to common stockholders per share in 2017 were impacted by a loss of 424 million or 015 per share on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all 5500 million of our outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 during december 2017 net income and funds from operations available to common stockholders were also impacted by a noncash redemption charge of 134 million or 005 per share upon the redemption of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that was redeemed in april 2017 this charge is based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that we paid in 2012 

  

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

in 2017 our affo increased by 1022 million or 139 to 8386 million as compared to 7364 million in 2016 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 306 in 2017 as compared to 288 in 2016 an increase of 018 or 63 

  

see our discussion of ffo and affo which are not financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles or gaap later in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and affo 

  

dividend policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock 

  

distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of tau operating partnership lp and realty income lp each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders 

  

 5  

  

in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2017 our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled 6955 million or approximately 1329 of our estimated taxable income of 5235 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our cash distributions to common stockholders in 2017 totaled 6893 million representing 822 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 8386 million in comparison our 2016 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 6105 million representing 829 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 7364 million 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year however noncorporate stockholders including individuals generally may deduct 20 of dividends from a reit other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 

  

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 217 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2017 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we estimate that in 2018 between 15 and 25 of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital 

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of primarily singletenant commercial properties under longterm net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income a net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on 1 increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 2 fixed increases or 3 additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm net lease agreements generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy we believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant industry geography and to a certain extent property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio that as of december 31 2017 consisted of 

  

 6  

  

5172 properties located in 49 states and puerto rico leased to 249 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 industries no single industry represented in our property portfolio accounted for more than 106 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2017 

  

investment strategy 

our investment strategy is to acquire real estate leased to regional and national tenants when identifying new properties for investment we generally focus on acquiring highquality real estate that tenants consider important to the successful operation of their business we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

  

·   properties that are freestanding commerciallyzoned with a single tenant 

·   properties that are in significant markets or strategic locations critical to generating revenue for regional and national tenants ie they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business 

·   properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants andor can generally be characterized as important to the successful operations of the company’s business 

·   properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our tenants generally fungible and have good visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares 

·   properties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs 

·   properties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents and 

·   properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm net lease agreements offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases 

  

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national tenants are capturing market share through the selection of prime real estate locations supported by superior service quality control economies of scale consumer branding and advertising in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of singletenant properties net leased to different tenants operating in a variety of industries we have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities often using our relationships with various tenants ownersdevelopers brokers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions we also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations tenants and industries for investment this research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value 

  

in selecting potential investments we look for tenants with the following attributes 

  

·   tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow 

·   tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources 

·   tenants that are willing to sign a longterm lease 10 or more years and 

·   tenants that are large owners and users of real estate 

  

from a retail perspective our investment strategy is to target tenants that have a service nondiscretionary andor lowpricepoint component to their business we believe these characteristics better position tenants to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers as a result of the execution of this strategy over 90 of our annualized retail rental revenue in 2017 is derived from tenants with a service nondiscretionary andor low price point component to their business from a nonretail perspective we target industrial properties leased to fortune 1000 primarily investment grade rated companies we believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties 

  

after applying this investment strategy we pursue those transactions where we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable riskadjusted returns 

  

underwriting strategy 

in order to be considered for acquisition properties must meet stringent underwriting requirements we have established a fourpart analysis to examine each potential investment based on 

  

·   the aforementioned overall real estate characteristics including demographics replacement cost and comparative rental rates 

·   industry tenant including credit profile and market conditions 

·   store profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available and 

·   the importance of the real estate location to the operations of the tenants’ business

we believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligation is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive therefore in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property 

  

thus as the property owner we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition 

  

prior to entering into any transaction our research department conducts a review of a tenant’s credit quality the information reviewed may include reports and filings including any public credit ratings financial statements debt and equity analyst reports and reviews of corporate credit spreads stock prices market capitalization and other financial metrics we conduct additional due diligence including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates we continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed and providing summaries of these findings to management approximately 46 of our annualized rental revenue comes from properties leased to investment grade rated companies or their subsidiaries at december 31 2017 our top 20 tenants represented approximately 54 of our annualized revenue and ten of these tenants have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries of investment grade companies 

  

portfolio and asset management strategy 

in addition to pursuing new properties for investment we seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio and asset management 

  

generally our portfolio and asset management efforts seek to achieve 

  

·   rent increases at the expiration of existing leases when market conditions permit 

·   optimum exposure to certain tenants industries and markets through releasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties 

·   maximum assetlevel returns on properties that are released or sold 

·   additional value creation from the existing portfolio by enhancing individual properties pursuing alternative uses and deriving ancillary revenue and 

·   investment opportunities in new asset classes for the portfolio 

  

we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our tenants our tenants’ industries and the real estate locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality our active portfolio and asset management strategy pursues asset sales when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

·   generate higher returns 

·   enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

·   extend our average remaining lease term andor 

·   strategically decrease tenant industry or geographic concentration 

  

at december 31 2017 we classified nine properties with a carrying amount of 67 million as held for sale on our balance sheet for 2018 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate 75 to 100 million in property sales we plan to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during 2018 at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties

the active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy of maintaining high occupancy since 1970 our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 however we cannot assure you that our future occupancy levels will continue to equal or exceed 96 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2017 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 613 billion or approximately 274 of our total market capitalization of 2236 billion 

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2017 as the sum of 

  

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 284213685 plus total common units outstanding of 405204 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 5702 per share on december 31 2017 or 1623 billion 

·   outstanding borrowings of 1100 million on our credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 3203 million excluding net mortgage premiums of 59 million and deferred financing costs of 236000 

·   outstanding borrowings of 4459 million on our term loans excluding deferred financing costs of 580000 and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 525 billion excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of 143 million and deferred financing costs of 341 million 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

universal shelf registration 

in december 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in december 2018 in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering

20 billion revolving credit facility 

we have a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or our credit facility with an initial term that expires in june 2019 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions our credit facility has a 10 billion accordion expansion option under our credit facility our investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2017 provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 085 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 0975 over libor the borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings were to change we also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2017 we had a borrowing capacity of 189 billion available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 1100 million the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2017 was 45 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2017 we remain in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend renew or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2017 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 69 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies as of december 31 2017 we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of a3 with a “stable” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “positive” outlook and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our ratings as of december 31 2017 the facility interest rate as of december 31 2017 was libor plus 085 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 0975 over libor our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 155 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 085 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 030 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 0125 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

this “risk factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders” unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock

in order to grow w e need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

  

we face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties we expect competition from 

  

·   businesses 

·   individuals 

·   fiduciary accounts and plans and 

·   other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

  

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

  

cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

  

·   lack of demand in areas where our properties are located 

·   inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants 

·   oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates 

·   declines in our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent which may be affected by their operations economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators 

·   defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations 

·   economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located and 

·   deterioration of physical condition of our properties 

  

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us 

  

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a tenant for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness 

  

 21  

  

eightythree of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2017 82 of which were singletenant properties at december 31 2017 55 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2017 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

for 2017 our tenants in the “drug store” industry accounted for approximately 106 of our rental revenue a downturn in this industry whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states or a change in legislation relating to prescription drugs could adversely affect tenants in this industry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock including the common stock offered hereby and preferred stock 

  

individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2017 nevertheless  downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in addition we may in the future make additional investments in the “drug store” industry which would increase this industry’s percentage of our rental revenues thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in this industry would have on us 

  

in addition some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have limited financial and other resources and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional national or international economy 

  

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant net lease locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states and properties leased to tenants engaged in nonretail businesses these risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties new types of real estate locations and lease structures and the laws and culture of any nonus jurisdiction 

  

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

·   our knowledge of the contamination 

·   the timing of the contamination 

·   the cause of the contamination or 

·   the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

 22  

  

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings with asbestos in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation andor that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of tenants’ activities on the properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements obtaining environmental insurance or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation however it is possible that one or more of our tenants could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities 

  

compliance   we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

  

insurance and indemnity   in july 2012 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in july 2022 and replaced our previous sevenyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 60 million in the aggregate the limits on the excess policy are 5 million per occurrence and 10 million in the aggregate therefore the primary and excess tenyear policies together provide a total limit of 15 million per occurrence and 70 million in the aggregate 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

 23  

  

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

·   we would be required to pay regular us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income 

·   we would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income 

·   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

·   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

·   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property   any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities  

  

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our investors the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue services or the irs and the us department of the treasury or the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could adversely affect us or our investors including holders of our common stock or debt securities we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

  

recently enacted us tax legislation or the 2017 tax legislation has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders we are still evaluating the potential impact of the 2017 tax legislation on us but the changes made by the 2017 tax legislation that could affect us and our investors include 

  

·   temporarily reducing individual us federal income tax rates on ordinary income including the reduction of the highest individual us federal income tax rate from 396 to 37 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 

·   permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure which previously imposed a maximum corporate tax rate of 35 and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21 

·   permitting a deduction for certain domestic qualified business income from passthrough income entities including dividends received by our stockholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income which will allow individuals trusts and estates to deduct up to 20 of such amounts for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 

·   reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to nonus stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of us real property interests from 35 to 21 

·   limiting our deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 to 80 of reit taxable income prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction 

·   generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30 of a business’s “adjusted taxable income” except for taxpayers including most equity reits that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system with longer depreciation periods and 

·   eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax 

  

 24  

  

many of these changes are effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation in addition it is unclear how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us 

  

distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that under certain circumstances may be exchanged for shares of our common stock this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of or refinance the debt on the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain similarly we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at december 31 2017 we had 1100 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility a total of 525 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of 143 million and deferred financing costs of 341 million 4459 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured term loans excluding deferred financing costs of 580000 and approximately 3203 million of outstanding mortgage debt excluding net unamortized premiums totaling 59 million and deferred financing costs of 236000 on this mortgage debt to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as 

  

 25  

  

a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility our term loans and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and the recent global financial crisis and related uncertainties including the impact of the united kingdom’s advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union referred to as brexit we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

  

in addition our revolving credit facility our term loan facilities and mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our revolving credit facility and our 2500 million term loan facility both of which are governed by the same credit agreement provide that if an event of default as defined in the credit agreement exists neither we nor any of our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may pay any dividends or other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

  

·   the sum of a 95 of our adjusted funds from operations as defined in the credit agreement for that period plus b the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period and 

·   the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of any income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders 

  

except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock the credit agreement further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement we and our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or other distributions on except for a distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and b dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under the credit agreement were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness or prevent us from paying those dividends other distributions interest or principal altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit likewise one of our subsidiaries is the borrower under our 700 million term loan facility and that facility requires that this subsidiary maintain its consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the term loan facility above a certain minimum dollar amount and comply with certain other financial covenants this minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant may limit the ability of this subsidiary as well as other subsidiaries that are owned by this subsidiary to provide funds to us in order to pay dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and amounts due on our indebtedness any failure by this subsidiary to comply with these financial covenants will and any failure by this subsidiary to comply with other covenants in our 700 million term loan facility may result in an event of default under that facility which could have adverse consequences similar to those that may result from an event of default under our revolving credit facility or 2500 million term loan facility as described above 

  

 26  

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities including 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 

·   requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 

·   limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

·   putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

  

if we default under a credit facility loan agreement or other debt instrument the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and in the case of secured indebtedness to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral 

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control including 

  

·   prevailing interest rates increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities 

·   the market for similar securities issued by other reits 

·   general economic political and financial market conditions 

·   the financial condition performance and prospects of us our tenants and our competitors 

·   changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations 

·   litigation and regulatory proceedings 

·   changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us our competitors or our industry 

·   changes in our credit ratings and 

·   actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors 

  

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the united states or us trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

·   adverse changes in general or local economic conditions 

·   changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties 

·   changes in interest rates and operating expenses 

·   competition for tenants 

  

 27  

  

·   changes in market rental rates 

·   inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases 

·   renewal of leases at lower rental rates 

·   inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship including bankruptcy 

·   changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate 

·   uninsured property liability 

·   property damage or casualty losses 

·   unexpected expenditures for capital improvements including requirements to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws 

·   the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties 

·   development oriented activities 

·   physical or weatherrelated damage to properties 

·   the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time 

·   acts of terrorism and war and 

·   acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

  

real estate property investments are illiquid therefore the company may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

we are engaged in the process of identifying analyzing underwriting and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions 

  

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our 

  

 28  

  

results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

in addition although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects such as claims of ownership liens or other encumbrances there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property cause a financial misstatement or lead to reputational damage to the company 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

litigation risks could affect our business 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

  

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry 

  

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our tenants our business or the united states generally 

  

 29  

  

if events like these were to occur they could materially interrupt our business operations cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and maintenance of records which may include personal identifying information although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the theft of intellectual property personal information or personal property such as in the event of cyberattacks any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations result in theft of company assets damage our reputation subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system in 2018 we may experience difficulties with this system which could potentially result in disruption to our normal accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting inaccuracies in the conversion of electronic data difficulties integrating the systems and processes additional costs to continue to refine the system’s functionality and disruption of our financial reporting process 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last several years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably in addition recent global financial crises such as concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar effect these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing unrest in certain middle eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

  

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent 

  

 30  

  

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our internal controls over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and disclosures our reit qualification being jeopardized impairment in the company’s access to capital civil litigation or investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms 

campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company if we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future our business could be adversely affected as such activities could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties tenants and financing sources and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or existing sellers of properties tenants or financing sources choose to delay defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues then our results of operations could be adversely affected similarly we may suffer damage to our reputation for example regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities including the notes resulting in significant loss of value which could impact our ability to access capital increase our cost of capital and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms 

  

our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock 

our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to among other purposes assist us in maintaining our status as a reit for united states federal andor state income tax purposes for example our charter restricts any person from acquiring actual or constructive ownership of more than 98 in value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock these restrictions could have antitakeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

liquidity and capital resources 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2017 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 613 billion or approximately 274 of our total market capitalization of 2236 billion 

  

 35  

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2017 as the sum of 

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 284213685 plus total common units outstanding of 405204 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 5702 per share on december 31 2017 or 1623 billion 

·   outstanding borrowings of 1100 million on our credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 3203 million excluding net mortgage premiums of 59 million and deferred financing costs of 236000 

·   outstanding borrowings of 4459 million on our term loans excluding deferred financing costs of 580000 and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 525 billion excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of 143 million and deferred financing costs of 341 million 

  

universal shelf registration 

in december 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in december 2018 in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

  

atthemarket atm programs 

in september 2015 we established an “atthemarket” equity distribution program or our prior atm program pursuant to which we were permitted to offer and sell up to 12000000 shares of common stock to or through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the nyse at prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices in october 2017 following the issuance and sale of the remaining shares under our prior atm program we established a new “atthemarket” equity distribution plan or our new atm program and together with our prior atm program our atm programs pursuant to which we are permitted to offer and sell up to 17000000 additional shares of common stock during 2017 we issued 10914088 shares and raised gross proceeds of 6217 million under our atm programs from the inception of our atm programs through december 31 2017 we have issued 14407529 shares authorized by our atm programs and raised 8248 million 

  

issuance of common stock 

in march 2017 we issued 11850000 shares of common stock after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of 298 million the net proceeds of 7049 million were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility 

  

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or our drspp provides our common stockholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions our drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions our drspp authorizes up to 26000000 common shares to be issued our drspp includes a waiver approval process allowing larger investors or institutions per a formal approval process to purchase shares at a small discount if approved by us during 2017 we issued 1193653 shares and raised approximately 699 million under our drspp of which we issued 927695 shares and raised 547 million under the waiver approval process 

  

20 billion revolving credit facility 

we have a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or our credit facility with an initial term that expires in june 2019 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions our credit facility has a 10 billion accordion expansion option under our credit facility our investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2017 provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 085 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 0975 over libor the borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings were to change we also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

 36  

  

at december 31 2017 we had a borrowing capacity of 189 billion available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 1100 million the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding at december 31 2017 was 45 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2017 we were in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend renew or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

term loans 

in december 2017 in conjunction with the acquisition of a portfolio of properties we entered into a 1259 million promissory note maturing in january 2018 borrowings under this note bore interest at 152 this note was paid in full at maturity 

  

in june 2015 in conjunction with entering into our credit facility we entered into a 250 million senior unsecured term loan maturing on june 30 2020 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current onemonth libor plus 090 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 262 

  

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of american realty capital trust inc or arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan with an initial maturity date of january 2018 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current onemonth libor plus 110 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 205 in january 2018 we entered into a sixmonth extension of this loan which now matures in july 2018 and includes at our option two additional sixmonth extensions borrowing during the extension periods bear interest at the current onemonth libor plus 090 the interest rate swap terminated upon the initial maturity in january 2018 

  

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2017 we had 3203 million of mortgages payable all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions additionally at december 31 2017 we had net premiums totaling 59 million on these mortgages and deferred financing costs of 236000 we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that would make it economically feasible to do so during 2017 we made 1397 million of principal payments including the repayment of eight mortgages in full for 1335 million 

  

 37  

  

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2017 sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2017 we issued the following notes dollars in millions 

  

   

1 this issuance constitutes a further issuance of and formed a single series with the senior notes due 2026 issued in september 2014 

2 this issuance constituted a further issuance of and formed a single series with the senior notes due 2022 issued in october 2012 

3 this issuance constituted a further issuance of and formed a single series with the senior notes due 2047 issued in march 2017 

  

the net proceeds of 13 billion from the december 2017 note offerings were used to redeem all 5500 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2019 notes including accrued and unpaid interest and to repay borrowings outstanding under our 20 billion revolving credit facility and to the extent not used for those purposes to fund the development and acquisitions of additional properties and for other general corporate purposes the net proceeds of 7052 million from the march 2017 note offerings were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility to fund investment opportunities and for other general corporate purposes 

  

in december 2017 we completed the early redemption on all 5500 million of outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a 424 million loss on extinguishment of debt which represents 015 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

in september 2017 we repaid our 1750 million of outstanding 5375 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants with which we remained in compliance as of december 31 2017 additionally interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 

  

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds these calculations which are not based on us gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2017 are 

  

 38  

  

   

1 our debt service coverage ratio is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding fourquarter period on the assumptions that i the incurrence of any debt as defined in the covenants incurred by us since the first day of such fourquarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom including to refinance other debt since the first day of such fourquarter period ii the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such fourquarter period and iii any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on january 1 2017 and subject to certain additional adjustments such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses i ii and iii of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1 2017 nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period our fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as our debt service coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator since we redeemed our class f preferred dividends in april 2017 our fixed charge coverage ratio is equivalent to our debt service coverage ratio the following is our calculation of debt service and fixed charge coverage at december 31 2017 in thousands for trailing twelve months 

  

   

1 interest expense includes a loss of 424 million related to the extinguishment of debt 

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2017 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 69 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies as of december 31 2017 we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of a3 with a “stable” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “positive” outlook and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our ratings as of december 31 2017 the facility interest rate as of december 31 2017 was libor plus 085 with a facility commitment fee of 0125 for allin drawn pricing of 0975 over libor our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 155 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 085 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 030 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 0125 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

 39  

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

table of obligations 

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2017 dollars in millions 

  

   

1 the initial term of the credit facility expires in june 2019 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions 

2 excludes noncash net original issuance premiums recorded on notes payable the unamortized balance of the net original issuance premiums at december 31 2017 is 143 million also excludes deferred financing costs of 341 million 

3 excludes deferred financing costs of 580000 

4 excludes noncash net premiums recorded on the mortgages payable the unamortized balance of these net premiums at december 31 2017 is 59 million also excludes deferred financing costs of 236000 

5 interest on the term loans notes bonds mortgages payable and credit facility has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december 31 2017 through their respective maturity dates 

6 realty income currently pays the ground lessors directly for the rent under the ground leases 

7 our tenants who are generally subtenants under ground leases are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases in the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent we are primarily responsible 

8  “other” consists of 644 million of commitments under construction contracts and 138 million of commitments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 

  

our credit facility term loans and notes payable obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

  

no unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated investments nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

acquisitions during 2017 

during 2017 we invested 152 billion in 303 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 64 the 303 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states will contain approximately 78 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 144 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 23 industries and the property types are 945 retail and 55 industrial based on rental revenue during 2017 none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2017 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

 40  

  

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 152 billion we invested during 2017 212 million was invested in 17 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 69 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2017 we had 83 properties available for lease out of 5172 properties in our portfolio which represents a 984 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio since december 31 2016 when we reported 84 properties available for lease out of 4944 and a 983 occupancy rate we 

  

·   had 297 lease expirations including leases rejected in bankruptcy 

·   released 259 properties and 

·   sold 39 vacant properties 

  

of the 259 properties released during 2017 235 properties were released to existing tenants nine were released to new tenants without vacancy and 15 were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 259 leases was 4318 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 4092 million which represents a rent recapture rate of 1055 on the properties released during 2017 

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated 3 rd party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

at december 31 2017 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1377 per square foot on the 5089 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2017 we classified nine properties with a carrying amount of 67 million as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2017 we capitalized costs of 127 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 16 million for releasing costs 912000 for recurring capital expenditures and 102 million for nonrecurring building improvements in 2016 we capitalized costs of 163 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 797000 for releasing costs 679000 for recurring capital expenditures and 149 million for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and repetitive landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements where we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the property 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 49year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2017 and twice in 2018 as of february 2018 we have paid 81 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 95 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 

  

 41  

  

   

the dividends paid per share during 2017 totaled approximately 2527 as compared to approximately 2392 during 2016 an increase of 0135 or 56 

  

the monthly dividend of 0219 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2628 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 46 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 5702 on december 31 2017 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when acquiring a property for investment purposes we typically allocate the cost of real estate acquired inclusive of transaction costs to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their relative estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value of inplace leases the value of inplace leases in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the market where the property is located in addition any assumed mortgages receivable or payable are recorded at their estimated fair values the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors such as industry type tenant investment grade maturity date and comparable borrowings for similar assets the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods historical sales and releases capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property 

  

 42  

  

is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

  

total revenue 

the following summarizes our total revenue dollars in thousands 

  

   

rental revenue 

the increase in rental revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to 

·   the 287 properties 72 million square feet we acquired in 2017 which generated 358 million of rent in 2017 

·   the 475 properties 76 million square feet we acquired in 2016 which generated 1144 million of rent in 2017 compared to 397 million in 2016 an increase of 747 million 

·   same store rents generated on 4254 properties 711 million square feet during 2017 and 2016 increased by 98 million or 10 to 9731 million from 9633 million partially offset by 

·   a net decrease in straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to rent of 30 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and 

·   a net decrease of 72 million relating to properties sold in 2017 and during 2016 and 

·   a net decrease of 13 million relating to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 147 properties comprising 29 million square feet that were available for lease during part of 2017 or 2016 ii rental revenue for 9 properties under development and iii lease termination settlements in aggregate the revenues for these items totaled 266 million in 2017 compared to 280 million in 2016 

  

 43  

  

the increase in rental revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to 

  

·   the 475 properties 76 million square feet we acquired in 2016 which generated 397 million of rent in 2016 

·   the 254 properties 56 million square feet we acquired in 2015 which generated 803 million of rent in 2016 compared to 419 million in 2015 an increase of 384 million 

·   same store rents generated on 4045 properties 665 million square feet during 2016 and 2015 increased by 1015 million or 12 to 88851 million from 87836 million and 

·   a net increase in straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to rent of 959000 in 2016 as compared to 2015 partially offset by 

·   a net decrease of 71 million relating to properties sold in 2016 and during 2015 and 

·   a net decrease of 16 million relating to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 131 properties comprising 15 million square feet that were available for lease during part of 2016 or 2015 ii rental revenue for 24 properties under development and iii lease termination settlements in aggregate the revenues for these items totaled 333 million in 2016 compared to 349 million in 2015 

  

for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were vacant at any time ii were under development or redevelopment or iii were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

of the 5172 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2017 5144 or 995 are singletenant properties and the remaining are multitenant properties of the 5144 singletenant properties 5062 or 984 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 95 years at december 31 2017 of our 5062 leased singletenant properties 4468 or 883 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

·   base rent increases tied to a consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 

·   percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales 

·   fixed increases or 

·   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 61 million in 2017 53 million in 2016 and 45 million in 2015  percentage rent in 2017 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2018 

  

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to regional and national tenants under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2017 our portfolio of 5172 properties was 984 leased with 83 properties available for lease as compared to 983 leased with 84 properties available for lease at december 31 2016 it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 

  

tenant reimbursements 

a number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses the increase in tenant reimbursements in the years presented is primarily due to our increase in acquisitions 

  

other revenue 

the decrease in other revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributed to a large amount of proceeds received related to condemnations in 2015

total expenses 

the following summarizes our total expenses dollars in thousands 

  

   

1 excludes tenant reimbursements revenue 

  

depreciation and amortization 

the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2016 and 2017 which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo” and “adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo 

  

interest expense 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

the increase in interest expense from 2016 to 2017 is primarily due to the march 2017 issuance of our 2047 notes and further issuance of our 2026 notes and to a lesser extent the december 2017 issuance of our 2028 notes and further issuance of our 2022 notes and 2047 notes this increase was partially offset by lower outstanding debt balances on mortgages payable as a result of the payoff of mortgages in 2016 and 2017 

  

the decrease in interest expense from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances on our notes payable and mortgages payable resulting from the payoff of 1500 million of our 2015 notes during november 2015 and 2750 million of our 2016 notes during september 2016 as well as the payoff of mortgages throughout 2015 and 2016 this decrease was slightly offset by an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of a 6000 million note in october 2016 

  

additionally each quarter we adjust the carrying value of our interest rate swaps to fair value changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded directly to interest expense

at december 31 2017 the weighted average interest rate on our 

·   credit facility outstanding borrowings of 1100 million was 45 

·   term loans outstanding of 4459 million excluding deferred financing costs of 580000 was 22 

·   mortgages payable of 3203 million excluding net premiums totaling 59 million and deferred financing costs of 236000 on these mortgages was 50 

·   notes and bonds payable of 525 billion excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of 143 million and deferred financing costs of 341 million was 39 and 

·   combined outstanding notes bonds mortgages term loan and credit facility borrowings of 613 billion was 39 

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased during 2017 and 2016 primarily due to higher compensation costs and higher headcount in january 2018 we had 152 employees as compared to 146 employees in january 2017 and 132 employees in january 2016 general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue have remained relatively consistent during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 at 50 49 and 50 respectively 

  

property expenses excluding reimbursable 

property expenses consist of costs associated with unleased properties nonnetleased properties and general portfolio expenses as well as contractually obligated reimbursable costs from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses expenses related to unleased properties and nonnetleased properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2017 83 properties were available for lease as compared to 84 at december 31 2016 and 71 at december 31 2015 we also incurred higher gross property expenses as a result of property taxes and bad debt expense on vacant properties property expenses as a percentage of total revenue have remained relatively consistent during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 at 20 19 and 14 respectively 

  

property expenses  reimbursable 

the increase in gross property expenses in both 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size which contributed to higher contractually obligated reimbursements primarily due to our acquisitions in each year 

  

income taxes 

income taxes are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by us and our subsidiaries the increase from 2016 to 2017 is primarily due to increased activity in our taxable reit subsidiary 

  

provisions for impairment 

in 2017 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 148 million on three properties classified as held for sale five properties classified as held for investment and 18 sold properties in 2016 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 207 million on four properties classified as held for investment and 35 sold properties in 2015 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 106 million on two properties classified as held for investment 12 sold properties and one property disposed of other than by sale 

  

other items 

  

gain on sales of real estate 

during 2017 we sold 59 properties for 1670 million which resulted in a gain of 409 million 

  

during 2016  we sold 77 properties for 905 million which resulted in a gain of 220 million additionally during 2016 we sold our former corporate headquarters building for 86 million 

  

during 2015 we sold 38 properties for 658 million which resulted in a gain of 222 million 

  

 46  

  

at december 31 2017 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 67 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2018 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate 75 to 100 million in yet to be identified property sales for all of 2018 we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in december 2017 we completed the early redemption on all 5500 million of outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 plus accrued and unpaid interest as a result of the early redemption we recognized a 424 million loss on extinguishment of debt which represents 015 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock dividends totaled 39 million in 2017 additionally in april 2017 we paid a final dividend on our class f preferred stock of 17 million which was recorded to interest expense preferred stock dividends totaled 271 million in 2016 and 2015 

  

excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

when we issued the irrevocable notice of redemption on our class f preferred stock in march 2017 we incurred a noncash charge of 134 million for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value the noncash charge represents the class f preferred stock original issuance cost that was paid in 2012 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 3015 million in 2017 compared to 2885 million in 2016 an increase of 130 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 110 in 2017 as compared to 113 in 2016 a decrease of 003 or 27 net income available to common stockholders was 2567 million in 2015  or 109 on a diluted per common share basis net income was impacted by a loss of 424 million or 015 per share loss on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all 5500 million of our outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 during december 2017 net income was also impacted by a noncash charge of 134 million or 005 per share for the redemption of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that was redeemed in april 2017 this charge is based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that we paid in 2012 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments gains from the sale of properties andor fair value adjustments on our interest rate swaps these items vary from period to period based on the timing of property sales and the interest rate environment and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders

adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure means for the most recent quarter earnings net income before i interest expense including noncash loss gain on swaps ii income and franchise taxes iii depreciation and amortization iv impairment losses and v gain on sales of real estate our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda reported by other companies that interpret the definitions of adjusted ebitda differently than we do management believes adjusted ebitda to be a meaningful measure of a reit’s performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts lenders and investors management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly adjusted ebitda metric is meaningful because it represents the company’s current earnings run rate for the period presented the ratio of our total debt to our annualized quarterly adjusted ebitda is also used to determine vesting of performance share awards granted to our executive officers adjusted ebitda should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance our ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda which is used by management as a measure of leverage is calculated by annualizing quarterly adjusted ebitda and then dividing by our total debt per the consolidated balance sheet 

  

   

1 interest expense includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of 424 million for the year ended december 31 2017 

2 we calculate annualized adjusted ebitda by multiplying the quarterly adjusted ebitda by four

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

  

in 2017 our ffo increased by 373 million or 51 to 7727 million as compared to 7354 million in 2016 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 282 in 2017 as compared to 288 in 2016 a decrease of 006 or 21 in 2015 ffo was 6524 million or 277 on a diluted per common share basis our ffo in 2017 was impacted by a loss of 424 million or 015 per share on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all 5500 million of our outstanding 675 notes due august 2019 during december 2017 ffo was also impacted by a noncash redemption charge of 134 million or 005 per share upon the redemption of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that was redeemed in april 2017 this charge is based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the 6625 monthly income class f preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that we paid in 2012 ffo for 2017 also includes the early redemption on all 5500 million of our outstanding 675 notes due august 15 2019 plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets and reduced by gains on property sales 

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

  

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

  

in 2017 our affo increased by 1022 million or 139 to 8386 million as compared to 7364 million in 2016 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 306 in 2017 as compared to 288 in 2016 an increase of 018 or 63 in 2015 affo was 6470 million or 274 on a diluted per common share basis we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term “cad” for cash available for distribution “fad” for funds available for distribution or other terms 

  

 49  

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

  

presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity our ability to make cash distributions or our ability to pay interest payments

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings or fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

moreover our use of net lease agreements tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the tenant is responsible for property expenses inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility term loans mortgages payable and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

  

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2017 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  

expected maturity data 

  

   

 51  

  

2   we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes and bonds at december 31 2017 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at december 31 2017 on the relevant forward interest rate curve plus an applicable creditadjusted spread we believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance and term loans balance reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at december 31 2017 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2017 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates all of our mortgages payable except three mortgages with principal balances totaling 299 million at december 31 2017 have fixed interest rates after factoring in arrangements that limit our exposure to interest rate risk and effectively fix our per annum interest rates our mortgage debt subject to variable rates totals 224 million at december 31 2017 interest on our credit facility and term loan balances is variable however the variable interest rate feature on our term loans has been mitigated by interest rate swap agreements based on our credit facility balance of 1100 million at december 31 2017 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest rate costs by 11 million per year 

  




 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

 81  

  

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal controlintegrated framework 2013” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting

paul m meurer executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer 

  

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

recent developments 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 48year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend six times during 2016 and twice during 2017 as of february 2017 we have paid 77 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 90 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 

  

   

  

the dividends paid per share during 2016 totaled approximately 2392 as compared to approximately 2271 during 2015 an increase of 0121 or 53 

  

the monthly dividend of 02105 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2526 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 42 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 5963 on january 31 2017 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

acquisitions during 2016 

during 2016 we invested 186 billion in 505 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 63 the 505 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states will contain approximately 82 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 147 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 28 industries and the property types are 864 retail and 136 industrial based on rental revenue during 2016 none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2016 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 186 billion we invested during 2016 1038 million was invested in 33 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 71 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future

portfolio discussion 

  

leasing results 

at december 31 2016 we had 84 properties available for lease out of 4944 properties in our portfolio which represents a 983 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio since december 31 2015 when we reported 71 properties available for lease out of 4538 and a 984 occupancy rate we 

  

   

of the 186 properties released during 2016 144 properties were released to existing tenants 21 were released to the same tenants without vacancy and 21 were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 186 leases was 2857 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 2733 million which represents a rent recapture rate of 1045 on the properties released during 2016 

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

at december 31 2016 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1364 per square foot on the 4860 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2016 we classified 15 properties with a carrying amount of 266 million as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2016 we capitalized costs of 163 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 797000 for releasing costs 679000 for recurring capital expenditures and 149 million for nonrecurring building improvements in 2015 we capitalized costs of 115 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 748000 for releasing costs 76 million for recurring capital expenditures and 32 million for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

note issuance 

in october 2016 we issued 600 million of 3000 senior unsecured notes due january 2027 the public offering price for the notes was 98671 of the principal amount for an effective yield to maturity of 3153 the net proceeds of approximately 5867 million from the offering were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 

  

capital raising 

during 2016 realty income issued 9449167 common shares at a weighted average price of 6061 receiving gross proceeds of 5727 million

net income available to common stockholders was 2885 million in 2016 as compared to 2567 million in 2015 an increase of 318 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 113 in 2016 as compared to 109 in 2015 an increase of 004 or 37 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments gains from the sale of properties andor fair value adjustments on our interest rate swaps these items vary from period to period based on the timing of property sales and the interest rate environment and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders

gains from the sale of properties during 2016 were 220 million as compared to gains from the sale of properties of 222 million during 2015 

  

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

in 2016 our ffo increased by 830 million or 127 to 7354 million as compared to 6524 million in 2015 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 288 in 2016 compared to 277 in 2015 an increase of 011 or 40

see our discussion of ffo and affo which are not financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles or gaap later in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and affo 

  

dividend policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock and class f preferred stock if and when declared by our board of directors 

  

distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of tau operating partnership lp and realty income lp each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders 

  

in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2016 our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled 6376 million or approximately 1292 of our estimated taxable income of 4934 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our cash distributions to common stockholders in 2016 totaled 6105 million representing 829 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 7364 million in comparison our 2015 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 5332 million representing 824 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 6470 million 

  

the class f preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6625 per annum on the 2500 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 165625 per annum per share 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year 

  

 5  

  

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 215 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2016 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we estimate that in 2017 between 15 and 25 of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital 

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income a net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on 1 increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 2 fixed increases or 3 additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm net lease agreements generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

diversification is also a key component of our business philosophy we believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant industry geography and to a certain extent property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio that as of december 31 2016 consisted of 4944 properties located in 49 states and puerto rico leased to 248 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 industries each of the 47 industries represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for no more than 114 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2016 

  

investment strategy 

our investment strategy is to acquire real estate leased to regional and national tenants when identifying new properties for investment we generally focus on acquiring highquality real estate that tenants consider important to the successful operation of their business we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

  

   

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national tenants are capturing market share through the selection of prime real estate locations supported by superior service quality control economies of scale consumer branding and advertising in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of singletenant properties net leased to different tenants operating in a variety of industries we have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities often using our relationships with various tenants ownersdevelopers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions we also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations tenants and industries for investment this research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value 

  

 6  

  

in selecting potential investments we look for tenants with the following attributes 

  

   

from a retail perspective our investment strategy is to target tenants that have a service nondiscretionary andor lowpricepoint component to their business we believe these characteristics better position tenants to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers as a result of the execution of this strategy over 90 of our annualized retail rental revenue is derived from tenants with a service nondiscretionary andor low price point component to their business from a nonretail perspective we target industrial properties leased to fortune 1000 primarily investment grade rated companies we believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties 

  

after applying this investment strategy we pursue those transactions where we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable riskadjusted returns 

  

underwriting strategy 

in order to be considered for acquisition properties must meet stringent underwriting requirements we have established a fourpart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

  

   

we believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligation is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive therefore in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property 

  

thus as the property owner we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition 

  

prior to entering into any transaction our research department conducts a review of a tenant’s credit quality the information reviewed may include reports and filings including any public credit ratings financial statements debt and equity analyst reports and reviews of corporate credit spreads stock prices market capitalization and other financial metrics we conduct additional due diligence including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates we continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed and providing summaries of these findings to management we estimate that approximately 47 of our annualized rental revenue comes from properties leased to investment grade rated companies or their subsidiaries at december 31 2016 our top 20 tenants represent approximately 53 of our annualized revenue and ten of these tenants have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries of investment grade companies

portfolio and asset management strategy 

in addition to pursuing new properties for investment we seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio and asset management 

  

generally our portfolio and asset management efforts seek to achieve 

  

   

we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our tenants our tenants’ industries and the real estate locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality our active portfolio and asset management strategy pursues asset sales when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

   

at december 31 2016 we classified 15 properties with a carrying amount of 266 million as held for sale on our balance sheet for 2017 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate 75 to 100 million in property sales we plan to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during 2017 at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

the active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy of maintaining high occupancy since 1970 our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 however we cannot assure you that our future occupancy levels will continue to equal or exceed 96 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the longterm we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2016 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 5875 billion or approximately 276 of our total market capitalization of 2126 billion 

  

 8  

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2016 as the sum of 

  

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 260168259 plus total common units outstanding of 405204 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 5748 per share on december 31 2016 or 1498 billion 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class f preferred stock of 4088 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 112 billion on our credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 4600 million excluding net mortgage premiums of 64 million and deferred financing costs of 324000 

·   outstanding borrowings of 3200 million on our term loans excluding deferred financing costs of 873000 and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 398 billion excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 198 million and deferred financing costs of 208 million 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

universal shelf registration 

in december 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in december 2018 in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

  

20 billion revolving credit facility 

in june 2015 we entered into a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or our credit facility that expires in june 2019 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions our credit facility has a 10 billion accordion expansion option under our credit facility our investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2016 provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 090 with a facility commitment fee of 015 for allin drawn pricing of 105 over libor the borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings change we also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2016 we had a borrowing capacity of 8800 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 112 billion the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2016 was 17 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2016 we remain in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms 

  

 9  

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2016 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 94 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies as of december 31 2016 we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a “positive” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “positive” outlook and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our ratings as of december 31 2016 the facility interest rate as of december 31 2016 was libor plus 090 with a facility commitment fee of 015 for allin drawn pricing of 105 over libor our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 155 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 085 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 030 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 0125 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

term loans 

in june 2015 in conjunction with entering into our credit facility we entered into a 250 million senior unsecured term loan maturing june 30 2020 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at libor plus 095 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 267 

  

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of american realty capital trust arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in january 2018 borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor plus 120 in conjunction with this term loan we also acquired an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 215

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

this “risk factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders” unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock

in order to grow w e need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

we face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties we expect competition from 

  

   

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

  

   

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us 

  

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a tenant for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness

eightyfour of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2016 all of which were singletenant properties at december 31 2016 47 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2016 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

for 2016 our tenants in the “drug store” industry accounted for approximately 114 of our rental revenue a downturn in this industry whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states or a change in legislation relating to prescription drugs could adversely affect tenants in this industry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock including the common stock offered hereby and preferred stock 

  

individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2016 nevertheless downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in addition we may in the future make additional investments in the “drug store” industry which would increase this industry’s percentage of our rental revenues thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in this industry would have on us 

  

in addition some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have limited financial and other resources and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional national or international economy 

  

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant net lease locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states and properties leased to tenants engaged in nonretail businesses these risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties new types of real estate locations and lease structures and the laws and culture of any nonus jurisdiction 

  

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

   

there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

 21  

  

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings with asbestos in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation andor that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of tenants’ activities on the properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements obtaining environmental insurance or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation however it is possible that one or more of our tenants could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities 

  

compliance   we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

  

insurance and indemnity   in july 2012 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in july 2022 and replaced our previous sevenyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 60 million in the aggregate the limits on the excess policy are 5 million per occurrence and 10 million in the aggregate therefore the primary and excess tenyear policies together provide a total limit of 15 million per occurrence and 70 million in the aggregate 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

 22  

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

  

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

   

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property   any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities  

  

distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

 23  

  

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that under certain circumstances may be exchanged for shares of our common stock this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of or refinance the debt on the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain similarly we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at december 31 2016 we had 112 billion of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility a total of 398 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 198 million and deferred financing costs of 208 million 3200 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured term loans excluding deferred financing costs of 873000 and approximately 4600 million of outstanding mortgage debt excluding net unamortized premiums totaling 64 million and deferred financing costs of 324000 on this mortgage debt to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility our term loans and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis and related uncertainties including the impact of the united kingdom’s advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union referred to as brexit we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

  

in addition our revolving credit facility our term loan facilities and mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our revolving credit facility and our 2500 million term loan facility both of which are governed by the same credit agreement provide that if an event of default as defined in the credit agreement exists neither we nor any of our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may make any dividends or other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

  

   

except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock the credit agreement further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement we and our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or other distributions on except for a distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and b dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default 

  

 24  

  

under the credit agreement were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness or prevent us from paying those dividends other distributions interest or principal altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit likewise one of our subsidiaries is the borrower under our 700 million term loan facility and that facility requires that this subsidiary maintain its consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the term loan facility above a certain minimum dollar amount and comply with certain other financial covenants this minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant may limit the ability of this subsidiary as well as other subsidiaries that are owned by this subsidiary to provide funds to us in order to pay dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and amounts due on our indebtedness any failure by this subsidiary to comply with these financial covenants will and any failure by this subsidiary to comply with other covenants in our 700 million term loan facility may result in an event of default under that facility which could have adverse consequences similar to those that may result from an event of default under our revolving credit facility or 2500 million term loan facility as described above 

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities including 

  

   

if we default under a credit facility loan agreement or other debt instrument the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and in the case of secured indebtedness to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral 

  

in addition we have 16350000 shares of class f preferred stock outstanding the holders of which are entitled to receive before any dividends are paid on our common stock monthly dividends when as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us at the rate of 165625 per annum per share as a result we are subject to risks associated with preferred stock financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends on our preferred stock 

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control including 

  

   

 25  

  

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the united states or us trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

   

real estate property investments are illiquid therefore the company may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

we are engaged in the process of identifying analyzing underwriting and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions 

  

 26  

  

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

in addition although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects such as claims of ownership liens or other encumbrances there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property cause a financial misstatement or lead to reputational damage to the company 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

 27  

  

litigation risks could affect our business 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

  

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry 

  

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our tenants our business or the united states generally 

  

if events like these were to occur they could materially interrupt our business operations cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and maintenance of records which may include personal identifying information although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the theft of intellectual property personal information or personal property such as in the event of cyberattacks any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations result in theft of company assets damage our reputation subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition we may experience difficulties implementing or maintaining our new enterprise resource planning system which we intend to implement during 2017 which could potentially result in disruption to our normal accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting inaccuracies in the conversion of electronic data difficulties integrating the systems and processes additional costs to continue to refine the system’s functionality and disruption of our financial reporting process 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last several years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably in addition the ongoing global financial crisis which includes concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar effect these circumstances have materially impacted 

  

 28  

  

liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing unrest in certain middle eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

  

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent 

  

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement accuracy and safeguarding of assets any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports civil litigation or investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the financial accounting standards board or fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants 

  

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms 

campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company if we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future our business could be adversely affected as such activities could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of 

  

 29  

  

management and our employees from executing our business plan additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties tenants and financing sources and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or existing sellers of properties tenants or financing sources choose to delay defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues then our results of operations could be adversely affected similarly we may suffer damage to our reputation for example regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities including the notes resulting in significant loss of value which could impact our ability to access capital increase our cost of capital and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms 

  

our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock 

  

our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to among other purposes assist us in maintaining our status as a reit for united states federal andor state income tax purposes for example our charter restricts any person from acquiring actual or constructive ownership of more than 98 in value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock these restrictions could have antitakeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

liquidity and capital resources 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2016 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 5875 billion or approximately 276 of our total market capitalization of 2126 billion 

  

 33  

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2016 as the sum of 

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 260168259 plus total common units outstanding of 405204 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 5748 per share on december 31 2016 or 1498 billion 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class f preferred stock of 4088 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 112 billion on our credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 4600 million excluding net mortgage premiums of 64 million and deferred financing costs of 324000 

·   outstanding borrowings of 3200 million on our term loans excluding deferred financing costs of 873000 and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 398 billion excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 198 million and deferred financing costs of 208 million 

  

universal shelf registration 

in december 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in december 2018 in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

  

atthemarket atm program 

in september 2015 we established an “atthemarket” equity distribution program or our atm program pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to 12000000 shares of common stock to or through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the nyse at prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices during 2016 we issued 2779140 shares and raised gross proceeds of 1668 million under the atm program 

  

issuance of common stock 

in may 2016 we issued 6500000 shares of common stock after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of 121 million the net proceeds of 3836 million were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility 

  

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or our drspp provides our common stockholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions our drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions our drspp authorizes up to 26000000 common shares to be issued in 2013 we revised our drspp so that we would pay for a majority of the planrelated fees which were previously paid by investors and to institute a waiver approval process allowing larger investors or institutions per a formal approval process to purchase shares at a small discount if approved by us during 2016 we issued 170027 shares and raised approximately 103 million under our drspp during 2016 we did not issue shares under the waiver approval process 

  

preferred stock 

in february 2012 we issued 14950000 shares of our class f preferred stock at 2500 per share in april 2012 we issued an additional 1400000 shares of class f preferred stock at 252863 per share beginning february 15 2017 shares of our class f preferred stock are redeemable at our option for 2500 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on the shares of our class f preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears we are current on our obligations to pay dividends on our class f preferred stock

20 billion revolving credit facility 

in june 2015 we entered into a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or our credit facility that expires in june 2019 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions our credit facility has a 10 billion accordion expansion option under our credit facility our investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2016 provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 090 with a facility commitment fee of 015 for allin drawn pricing of 105 over libor the borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings were to change we also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2016 we had a borrowing capacity of 8800 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 112 billion the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2016 was 17 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2016 we were in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms 

  

term loans 

in june 2015 in conjunction with entering into our credit facility we entered into a 250 million senior unsecured term loan maturing june 30 2020 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at libor plus 095 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 267 

  

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of american realty capital trust or arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in january 2018 borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor plus 120 in conjunction with this term loan we also acquired an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 215 

  

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2016 we had 4600 million of mortgages payable all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions additionally at december 31 2016 we had net premiums totaling 64 million on these mortgages and deferred financing costs of 324000 we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that would make it economically feasible to do so during 2016 we made 2317 million of principal payments including the repayment of 11 mortgages in full for 2018 million and refinanced one of our assumed mortgages whereby we received an additional 100 million in proceeds 

  

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2016 sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 

  

   

 35  

  

in october 2016 we issued 600 million of 3000 senior unsecured notes due january 2027 the public offering price for the notes was 98671 of the principal amount for an effective yield to maturity of 3153 the net proceeds of approximately 5867 million from the offering were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 

  

in september 2016 we repaid 275 million of outstanding 5950 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants with which we remained in compliance as of december 31 2016 additionally interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 

  

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds these calculations which are not based on us gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2016 are 

  

   

1 this covenant is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding fourquarter period on the assumptions that i the incurrence of any debt as defined in the covenants incurred by us since the first day of such fourquarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom including to refinance other debt since the first day of such fourquarter period ii the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such fourquarter period and iii any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on january 1 2016 and subject to certain additional adjustments such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses i ii and iii of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1 2016 nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period the following is our calculation of debt service coverage at december 31 2016 in thousands for trailing twelve months 

  

   

fixed charge coverage ratio 

  

fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as the debt service coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator similar to debt service coverage ratio we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculations of both debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios may be different from the calculations used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited the presentation of debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios should not be considered as alternatives to any us gaap operating performance measures below is our calculation of fixed charges at december 31 2016 in thousands for the trailing twelve months 

  

   

 36  

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2016 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 94 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

  

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies as of december 31 2016 we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a “positive” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “positive” outlook and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our ratings as of december 31 2016 the facility interest rate as of december 31 2016 was libor plus 090 with a facility commitment fee of 015 for allin drawn pricing of 105 over libor our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 155 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 085 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 030 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 0125 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

table of obligations 

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2016 dollars in millions 

  

   

1   the initial term of the credit facility expires in june 2019 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions 

2   excludes noncash original issuance discounts recorded on notes payable the unamortized balance of the original issuance discounts at december 31 2016 is 198 million also excludes deferred financing costs of 208 million 

3   excludes deferred financing costs of 873000 

4   excludes noncash net premiums recorded on the mortgages payable the unamortized balance of these net premiums at december 31 2016 is 64 million also excludes deferred financing costs of 324000 

5   interest on the term loans notes bonds mortgages payable and credit facility has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december 31 2016 through their respective maturity dates 

6   realty income currently pays the ground lessors directly for the rent under the ground leases 

7   our tenants who are generally subtenants under ground leases are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases in the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent we are primarily responsible 

8   “other” consists of 219 million of commitments under construction contracts and 70 million of commitments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 

  

 37  

  

our credit facility term loans and notes payable obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

  

no unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated investments nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

  

acquisitions during 2016 

during 2016 we invested 186 billion in 505 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 63 the 505 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states will contain approximately 82 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 147 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 28 industries and the property types are 864 retail and 136 industrial based on rental revenue during 2016 none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2016 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 186 billion we invested during 2016 1038 million was invested in 33 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 71 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2016 we had 84 properties available for lease out of 4944 properties in our portfolio which represents a 983 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio since december 31 2015 when we reported 71 properties available for lease out of 4538 and a 984 occupancy rate we 

  

·   had 256 lease expirations including leases rejected in bankruptcy 

·   released 186 properties and 

·   sold 57 vacant properties 

  

of the 186 properties released during 2016 144 properties were released to existing tenants 21 were released to new tenants without vacancy and 21 were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 186 leases was 2857 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 2733 million which represents a rent recapture rate of 1045 on the properties released during 2016 

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions to unrelated 3 rd party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

 38  

  

at december 31 2016 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1364 per square foot on the 4860 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2016 we classified 15 properties with a carrying amount of 266 million as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results the expected sale of these properties is consistent with our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2016 we capitalized costs of 163 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 797000 for releasing costs 679000 for recurring capital expenditures and 149 million for nonrecurring building improvements in 2015 we capitalized costs of 115 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 748000 for releasing costs 76 million for recurring capital expenditures and 32 million for nonrecurring building improvements 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

with the increasing size and aging of our portfolio overall investments in existing properties increased in 2016 and we refined our definition of recurring versus nonrecurring capital expenditures we define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and repetitive landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life we define nonrecurring capital expenditures as property improvements where we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the property 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

  

we have continued our 48year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend six times during 2016 and twice in 2017 as of february 2017 we have paid 77 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 90 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 

  

   

  

the dividends paid per share during 2016 totaled approximately 2392 as compared to approximately 2271 during 2015 an increase of 0121 or 53 

  

the monthly dividend of 02105 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2526 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 42 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 5963 on january 31 2017 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

 39  

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straightline method over an estimated useful life of 25 to 35 years for buildings and 4 to 20 years for improvements which we believe are appropriate estimates of useful life if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when acquiring a property for investment purposes we typically allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value of inplace leases the value of inplace leases and tenant relationships as applicable in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the market where the property is located in addition any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors such as industry type tenant investment grade maturity date and comparable borrowings for similar assets the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period which does not exceed one year the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods historical sales and releases capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 

  

rental revenue 

rental revenue was 1057 billion for 2016 as compared to 9769 million for 2015 an increase of 805 million or 82 rental revenue was 8935 million for 2014 the increase in rental revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to 

  

·   the 475 properties 76 million square feet we acquired in 2016 which generated 397 million of rent in 2016 

·   the 254 properties 56 million square feet we acquired in 2015 which generated 803 million of rent in 2016 compared to 419 million in 2015 an increase of 384 million 

·   same store rents generated on 4045 properties 665 million square feet during 2016 and 2015 increased by 1015 million or 12 to 88851 million from 87836 million and 

  

 40  

  

  

·   a net increase in straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to rent of 959000 in 2016 as compared to 2015 partially offset by 

·   a net decrease of 71 million relating to properties sold in 2016 and during 2015 and 

·   a net decrease of 16 million relating to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 131 properties comprising 15 million square feet that were available for lease during part of 2016 or 2015 ii rental revenue for 24 properties under development and iii lease termination settlements in aggregate the revenues for these items totaled 333 million in 2016 compared to 349 million in 2015 

  

for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were vacant at any time ii were under development or redevelopment and iii were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

  

of the 4944 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2016 4920 or 995 are singletenant properties and the remaining are multitenant properties of the 4920 singletenant properties 4836 or 983 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 98 years at december 31 2016 of our 4836 leased singletenant properties 4310 or 891 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

·   base rent increases tied to a consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 

·   percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales 

·   fixed increases or 

·   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 53 million in 2016 45 million in 2015 and 36 million in 2014 percentage rent in 2016 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2017 

  

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to regional and national tenants under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2016 our portfolio of 4944 properties was 983 leased with 84 properties available for lease as compared to 984 leased with 71 properties available for lease at december 31 2015 it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 

  

tenant reimbursements 

contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses were 431 million in 2016 compared to 420 million in 2015 and 371 million in 2014 the increase in tenant reimbursements is primarily due to our increase in acquisitions 

  

other revenue 

other revenue which comprises propertyrelated revenue not included in rental revenue or tenant reimbursements was 27 million in 2016 compared to 44 million in 2015 and 29 million in 2014 

  

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 4499 million for 2016 compared to 4092 million for 2015 and 3747 million for 2014 the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2015 and 2016 which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo” and “adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo 

  

 41  

  

interest expense 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

the decrease in interest expense from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances on our notes payable and mortgages payable resulting from the payoff of 1500 million of notes during november 2015 and 2750 million of notes during september 2016 as well as the payoff of mortgages throughout 2015 and 2016 this decrease was slightly offset by an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of a 600 million note in october 2016 

  

the increase in interest expense from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to the june 2014 issuance of our 388 senior unsecured notes due july 2024 the september 2014 issuance of our 4125 senior unsecured notes due october 2026 the interest expense on the 250 million term loan that was entered into during june 2015 and the payoff of mortgages during 2015 which reduced the amortization of net mortgage premiums 

  

additionally each quarter we adjust the carrying value of our interest rate swaps to fair value changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded directly to interest expense we recorded a gain on interest rate swaps of 16 million during 2016 and a loss on interest rate swaps of 30 million and 13 million during 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

at december 31 2016 the weighted average interest rate on our 

·   credit facility outstanding borrowings of 112 billion was 17 

·   term loans outstanding of 3200 million excluding deferred financing costs of 873000 was 17 

·   mortgages payable of 4600 million excluding net premiums totaling 64 million and deferred financing costs of 324000 on these mortgages was 49 

·   notes and bonds payable of 398 billion excluding unamortized original issue discounts of 198 million and deferred financing costs of 208 million was 44 and 

·   combined outstanding notes bonds mortgages term loan and credit facility borrowings of 588 billion was 38

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased by 27 million to 520 million for 2016 compared to 493 million in 2015 and 511 million in 2014 included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs of 346000 for 2016 913000 for 2015 and 453000 for 2014 general and administrative costs increased during 2016 primarily due to higher compensation costs general and administrative expenses decreased during 2015 primarily due to lower compensation costs lower corporate insurance premiums and lower proxy costs in january 2017 we had 146 employees as compared to 132 employees in january 2016 and 125 employees in january 2015 

  

   

1 excludes tenant reimbursements revenue as well as revenue included in discontinued operations and gain on sales 

  

property expenses including tenant reimbursable expenses 

property expenses consist of costs associated with unleased properties nonnetleased properties and general portfolio expenses as well as contractually obligated reimbursable costs from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses expenses related to unleased properties and nonnetleased properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2016 84 properties were available for lease as compared to 71 at december 31 2015 and 70 at december 31 2014 

  

property expenses were 629 million including 431 million in reimbursable expenses in 2016 554 million including 420 million in reimbursable expenses in 2015 and 539 million including 371 million in reimbursable expenses in 2014 the increase in gross property expenses in 2016 is primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size which contributed to higher contractually obligated reimbursements primarily due to our acquisitions during 2015 and 2016 we also incurred higher gross property expenses as a result of maintenance and utilities property taxes ground rent expenses legal costs and bad debt expense on vacant properties 

  

   

1 excludes tenant reimbursements revenue as well as revenue included in discontinued operations and gain on sales 

  

income taxes 

income taxes were 33 million in 2016 compared to 32 million in 2015 and 35 million in 2014 these amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by us and our subsidiaries 

  

provisions for impairment 

in 2016 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 207 million on six properties classified as held for sale two properties classified as held for investment and 31 sold properties these properties were not previously classified as held for sale in financial statements issued prior to the date of adoption of asu 201408 accordingly these provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income 

  

in 2015 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 106 million on three properties classified as held for investment 11 sold properties and one property disposed of other than by sale these properties were not previously classified as held for sale in financial statements issued prior to the date of adoption of asu 201408 accordingly these provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income 

  

in 2014 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 46 million provisions for impairment of 41 million are included in income from continuing operations on 10 sold properties and one property classified as held for sale these properties were not previously classified as held for sale in financial statements issued prior to the 

  

 43  

  

date of adoption of accounting standards update asu 201408 which amends topic 205 presentation of financial statements  and topic 360 property plant and equipment  accordingly these provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income additionally a provision for impairment of 510000 is included in income from discontinued operations on one sold property that was classified as held for sale as of december 31 2013 

  

gain on sales of real estate 

during 2016 we sold 77 properties for 905 million which resulted in a gain of 220 million additionally during 2016 we sold our former corporate headquarters building for 86 million 

  

during 2015 we sold 38 properties for 658 million which resulted in a gain of 222 million 

  

these property sales in 2016 and 2015 do not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and therefore do not require presentation as discontinued operations 

  

during 2014 we sold 47 properties for 1081 million which resulted in a gain of 421 million only the results of operations specifically related to the properties classified as held for sale at december 31 2013 and sold during 2014 were reclassified as discontinued operations 

  

at december 31 2016 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 266 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2017 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately 75 to 100 million in yet to be identified property sales for all of 2017 we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock dividends totaled 271 million in 2016 and 2015 and 371 million in 2014 

  

excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

in october 2014 we redeemed all 8800000 shares of our 675 monthly income class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock or the class e preferred stock for 2500 per share plus accrued dividends we incurred a noncash charge of 60 million this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 2885 million in 2016 compared to 2567 million in 2015 an increase of 318 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 113 in 2016 as compared to 109 in 2015 an increase of 004 or 37 net income available to common stockholders was 2276 million in 2014 or 104 on a diluted per common share basis net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carr ying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments gains from the sale of properties andor fair value adjustments on our interest rate swaps these items vary from period to period based on the timing of property sales and the interest rate environment and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

gains from the sale of properties during 2016 were 220 million as compared to gains from the sale of properties of 222 million during 2015 and 421 million during 2014

discontinued operations 

during the first quarter of 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that changed the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results we early adopted the requirements of this accounting pronouncement in the first quarter of 2014 starting with the first quarter of 2014 the results of operations for all qualifying disposals and properties classified as held for sale that were not previously reported in discontinued operations in our 2013 annual report on form 10k are presented within income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income for 2014 we recorded income from discontinued operations of 28 million or 001 per common share basic and diluted 

  

earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda 

ebitda a nongaap financial measure means for the most recent quarter earnings net income before i interest expense including noncash loss gain on swaps ii income and franchise taxes iii real estate depreciation and amortization iv impairment losses and v gain on sales of real estate our ebitda may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies that interpret the definitions of ebitda differently than we do management believes ebitda to be a meaningful measure of a reit’s performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts lenders and investors the ratio of our total debt to ebitda is also used to determine vesting of performance share awards granted to our executive officers ebitda should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance our ratio of debt to ebitda which is used by management as a measure of leverage is calculated by annualizing quarterly ebitda and then dividing by our total debt per the consolidated balance sheet 

  

   

1 we calculate annualized ebitda by multiplying the quarterly ebitda by four 

2 total debt is consistent with its definition under market capitalization as described in “liquidity and capital resources – conservative capital structure” earlier in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

  

in 2016 our ffo increased by 830 million or 127 to 7354 million compared to 6524 million in 2015 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 288 in 2016 compared to 277 in 2015 an increase of 011 or 40 in 2014 ffo was 5629 million or 258 on a diluted per common share basis our ffo in 2014 included a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trusts’ definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets and reduced by gains on property sales 

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

  

 46  

  

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

  

in 2016 our affo increased by 894 million or 138 to 7364 million compared to 6470 million in 2015 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 288 in 2016 compared to 274 in 2015 an increase of 014 or 51 in 2014 affo was 5617 million or 257 on a diluted per common share basis we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term “cad” for cash available for distribution “fad” for funds available for distribution or other terms 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

 47  

  

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

  

presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity our ability to make cash distributions or our ability to pay interest payments 

  

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings or fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

moreover our use of net lease agreements tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the tenant is responsible for property expenses inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility term loans mortgages payable and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

  

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

 48  

  

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2016 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  

   

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2016 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates all of our mortgages payable except six mortgages totaling 740 million at december 31 2016 including net unamortized discounts have fixed interest rates after factoring in arrangements that limit our exposure to interest rate risk and effectively fix our per annum interest rates our variable rate mortgage debt includes four mortgages totaling 382 million at december 31 2016 interest on our credit facility and term loan balances is variable however the variable interest rate feature on our term loans has been mitigated by interest rate swap agreements based on our credit facility balance of 112 billion at december 31 2016 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 112 million per year

 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2016 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal controlintegrated framework 2013” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

·   contractual rent increases on existing leases 

·   rent increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit 

·   optimum exposure to certain tenants and markets through releasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties 

·   maximum assetlevel returns on properties released andor sold 

·   optimum value of the existing portfolio by enhancing individual properties pursuing alternative uses and deriving ancillary revenue and

at december 31 2015 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

·   of 4538 properties 

·   with an occupancy rate of 984 or 4467 properties leased and 71 properties available for lease 

·   leased to 240 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries

·   with an average leasable space per property of approximately 16750 square feet approximately 11550 square feet per retail property and 216550 square feet per industrial property 

  

of the 4538 properties in the portfolio 4519 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining are multitenant properties at december 31 2015 of the 4519 singletenant properties 4448 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 100 years

recent developments 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 47year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2015 and two times during 2016 as of february 2016 we have paid 73 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 84 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 

  

   

the dividends paid per share during 2015 totaled approximately 22714167 as compared to approximately 21916254 during 2014 an increase of 00798 or 36 

  

the monthly dividend of 01985 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2382 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 43 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 5579 on january 29 2016 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

acquisitions during 2015 

during 2015 we invested 126 billion in 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 66 the 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states will contain approximately 62 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 165 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 21 industries and the property types consist of 873 retail and 127 industrial based on rental revenue during 2015 none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2015 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 126 billion we invested during 2015 458 million was invested in 35 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 97 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2015 we had 71 properties available for lease out of 4538 properties in our portfolio which represents a 984 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio since december 31 2014 when we reported 70 properties available for lease out of 4327 and a 984 occupancy rate we 

  

·   had 283 lease expirations 

·   released 253 properties and 

·   sold 29 vacant properties 

  

of the 253 properties released during 2015 216 properties were released to existing tenants seven were released to new tenants without vacancy and 30 were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 253 leases was 3746 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 3712 million which represents a rent recapture rate of 1009 on the properties released during 2015 

  

at december 31 2015 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1331 per square foot on the 4467 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2015 we classified ten properties with a carrying amount of 98 million as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected disposal of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2015 we capitalized costs of 115 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 748000 for releasing costs 76 million for recurring capital expenditures and 32 million for nonrecurring building improvements in 2014 we capitalized costs of 60 million on existing properties in our portfolio 

  

as part of our releasing costs we typically pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases

in september 2015 we established an “at the market” equity distribution program or our atm program pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to 12000000 shares of common stock to or through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the nyse or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices during 2015 we issued 714301 shares and raised approximately 363 million under the atm program 

  

new credit facility

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or the drspp provides our common stockholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions the drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions the drspp authorizes up to 26000000 common shares to be issued in 2013 we revised our drspp so that we would pay for a majority of the planrelated fees which were previously paid by investors and to institute a waiver approval process allowing larger investors or institutions per a formal approval process to purchase shares at a small discount if approved by us during 2015 we issued 7608354 shares and raised approximately 3630 million under the drspp of which 7413207 shares and 3537 million was raised under the waiver approval process 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 2567 million in 2015 compared to 2276 million in 2014 an increase of 291 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 109 in 2015 as compared to 104 in 2014 an increase of 005 or 48 net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments andor gains from the sale of properties the amount of impairments andor gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

gains from the sale of properties during 2015 were 222 million as compared to gains from the sale of properties of 421 million during 2014 

  

funds from operations ffo available to common stockholders 

in 2015 our ffo increased by 895 million or 159 to 6524 million compared to 5629 million in 2014 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 277 in 2015 compared to 258 in 2014 an increase of 019 or 74 our ffo in 2014 included a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

adjusted funds from operations affo available to common stockholders 

in 2015 our affo increased by 853 million or 152 to 6470 million versus 5617 million in 2014 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 274 in 2015 compared to 257 in 2014 an increase of 017 or 66 

  

see our discussion of ffo and affo which are not financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles or gaap later in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and affo 

  

dividend policy 

distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock and class f preferred stock if and when declared by our board of directors 

  

distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of tau operating partnership lp and realty income lp each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders 

  

 5  

  

in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2015 our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled 5603 million or approximately 1369 of our estimated taxable income of 4094 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our cash distributions to common stockholders in 2015 totaled 5332 million representing 824 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 6470 million in comparison our 2014 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 4793 million representing 853 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 5617 million 

  

the class f preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6625 per annum on the 2500 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 165625 per annum per share dividends on our class f preferred stock are current 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our new credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our new credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year 

  

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 238 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2015 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we estimate that in 2016 between 20 and 35 of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital 

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

investment philosophy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income a net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on 1 increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 2 fixed increases or 3 additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm net leases generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

 6  

  

diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy we believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant industry geography and to a certain extent property type leads to more predictable investment results for our shareholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration our investment efforts have led to a diversified property portfolio that as of december 31 2015 consisted of 4538 properties located in 49 states and puerto rico leased to 240 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 industries each of the 47 industries represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for no more than 109 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2015 since 1970 our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 however we cannot assure you that our future occupancy levels will continue to equal or exceed 96 

  

investment strategy 

our investment strategy is to act as a source of capital to regional and national tenants by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations when identifying new properties for investment we generally focus on acquiring the real estate tenants consider important to the successful operation of their business we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

  

·   properties that are freestanding commerciallyzoned with a single tenant 

·   properties that are in significant markets or strategic locations critical to generating revenue for regional and national tenants ie they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business 

·   properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants andor can generally be characterized as important to the successful operations of the company’s business 

·   properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our tenants and have good visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares 

·   properties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs 

·   properties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents and 

·   properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm net lease agreements offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases 

  

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national tenants are capturing market share through the selection of prime locations service quality control economies of scale strong consumer brands and advertising in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of singletenant properties net leased to different tenants operating in a variety of industries we have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities often using our relationships with various tenants ownersdevelopers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions we also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations tenants and industries for investment this research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value 

  

in selecting potential investments we look for tenants with the following attributes 

  

·   tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow 

·   tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources 

·   tenants that are willing to sign a longterm lease 10 or more years and 

·   tenants that are large owners and users of real estate 

  

from a retail perspective our investment strategy is to target tenants that have a service nondiscretionary andor lowpricepoint component to their business we believe these characteristics better position tenants to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers as a result of the execution of this strategy over 90 of our annualized retail rental revenue is derived from tenants with a service nondiscretionary andor low price point component to their business from a nonretail perspective we target industrial properties leased to fortune 1000 primarily investment grade rated companies we believe rental revenue generated from businesses with these characteristics is generally more durable and stable 

  

after applying this investment strategy we pursue those transactions where we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable riskadjusted returns 

  

 7  

  

underwriting strategy 

we believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligation is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive therefore in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that are weaker performers 

  

in order to be considered for acquisition properties must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit criteria we have established a fourpart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

  

·   overall real estate characteristics including property value and comparative rental rates 

·   industry company market conditions and credit profile 

·   store profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available and 

·   the importance of the real estate location to the operations of the tenants’ business 

  

prior to entering into any transaction our research department conducts a review of a tenant’s credit quality the information reviewed may include reports and filings including any public credit ratings financial statements debt and equity analyst reports and reviews of corporate credit spreads stock prices market capitalization and other financial metrics we conduct additional due diligence including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates we continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed and providing summaries of these findings to management we estimate that approximately 44 of our annualized rental revenue comes from properties leased to investment grade rated companies or their subsidiaries at december 31 2015 our top 20 tenants represent approximately 55 of our annualized revenue and eight of these tenants have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries of investment grade companies 

  

asset management strategy 

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our tenants our tenants’ industries and the locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality 

  

we regularly review and analyze 

  

·   the quality of the underlying real estate locations 

·   the performance of the various industries of our tenants and 

·   the operation management business planning and financial condition of our tenants 

  

we have an active asset management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

·   generate higher returns 

·   enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

·   extend our average remaining lease term or 

·   decrease tenant or industry concentration 

  

at december 31 2015 we classified ten properties with a carrying amount of 98 million as held for sale on our balance sheet for 2016 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate 50 to 75 million in property sales in 2016 we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during 2016 at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

 8  

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our long term capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the longterm we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our new credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our new credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2015 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 485 billion or approximately 266 of our total market capitalization of 1822 billion 

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2015 as the sum of 

  

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 250416757 plus total common units outstanding of 648386 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 5163 per share on december 31 2015 or 1296 billion 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class f preferred stock of 4088 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 2380 million on our new credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 6377 million excluding net mortgage premiums of 91 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 3200 million on our term loans and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 365 billion excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 133 million 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

universal shelf registration 

in december 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in december 2018 this replaced our prior shelf registration statement in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

  

20 billion revolving credit facility 

in june 2015 we entered into a new 2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our 15 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in may 2016 the initial term of our new credit facility expires in june 2019 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions our new credit facility has a 10 billion accordion expansion option under our new credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 09 with a facility commitment fee of 015 for allin drawn pricing of 105 over libor the borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor we also have other interest rate options available to us under our new credit facility our new credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

 9  

  

at december 31 2015 we had a borrowing capacity of 176 billion available on our new credit facility and an outstanding balance of 2380 million the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our new credit facility at december 31 2015 was 12 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2015 we remain in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our new credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms 

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 403 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our new credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our new credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a “stable” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook to our senior notes and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our current ratings the current facility interest rate is libor plus 09 with a facility commitment fee of 015 for allin drawn pricing of 105 over libor our new credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 155 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 085 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 03 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 0125 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

notes outstanding 

as of december 31 2015 we had 365 billion of senior unsecured note and bond obligations excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 133 million all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually

mortgage debt

term loans 

in june 2015 in conjunction with entering into our new credit facility we entered into a 250 million senior unsecured term loan maturing june 30 2020 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at libor plus 095 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 267

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

this “risk factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders” unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock

in order to grow w e need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

we face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties we expect competition from 

  

·   businesses 

·   individuals 

·   fiduciary accounts and plans and 

·   other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

  

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

  

·   lack of demand in areas where our properties are located 

·   inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants 

·   oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates 

·   declines in our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent which may be affected by their operations economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators 

·   defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations 

·   economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located and 

·   deterioration of physical condition of our properties 

  

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us 

  

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a tenant for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness 

  

 20  

  

seventyone of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2015 all of which were singletenant properties at december 31 2015 fortysix of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2015 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

for 2015 our tenants in the “drug store” industry accounted for approximately 109 of our rental revenue a downturn in this industry whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states or a change in legislation relating to prescription drugs could adversely affect tenants in this industry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock including the common stock offered hereby and preferred stock 

  

individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2015 nevertheless downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in addition we may in the future make additional investments in the “drug store” industry which would increase this industry’s percentage of our rental revenues thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in this industry would have on us 

  

in addition some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have limited financial and other resources and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional national or international economy 

  

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant net lease locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states and properties leased to tenants engaged in nonretail businesses these risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties new types of real estate locations and lease structures and the laws and culture of any nonus jurisdiction 

  

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

·   our knowledge of the contamination 

·   the timing of the contamination 

·   the cause of the contamination or 

·   the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

 21  

  

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings with asbestos in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation andor that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of tenants’ activities on the properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements obtaining environmental insurance or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation however it is possible that one or more of our tenants could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities 

  

compliance   we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

  

insurance and indemnity   in july 2012 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in july 2022 and replaced our previous sevenyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 60 million in the aggregate the limits on the excess policy are 5 million per occurrence and 10 million in the aggregate therefore the primary and excess tenyear policies together provide a total limit of 15 million per occurrence and 70 million in the aggregate 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

  

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

 22  

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

  

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

·   we would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

·   we would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income 

·   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

·   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

·   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

 23  

  

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that under certain circumstances may be exchanged for shares of our common stock this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of or refinance the debt on the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain similarly we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our new 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at december 31 2015 we had 2380 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility a total of 365 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 133 million 320 million of borrowings outstanding under a senior unsecured term loan and approximately 6377 million of outstanding mortgage debt excluding net premiums totaling 91 million on these mortgages to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

  

in addition our revolving credit facility our term loan facilities and mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our revolving credit facility and our 250 million term loan facility both of which are governed by the same credit agreement provide that if an event of default as defined in the credit agreement exists neither we nor any of our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may make any dividends or other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

  

·   the sum of a 95 of our adjusted funds from operations as defined in the credit agreement for that period plus b the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period and 

·   the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of any income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders 

  

except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock the credit agreement further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement we and our subsidiaries other than our whollyowned subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or other distributions on except for a distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and b dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under the credit agreement were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common stock and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or prevent us from paying those dividends or other distributions altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit likewise one of our subsidiaries is the borrower under our 700 million term loan facility and that facility requires that this subsidiary maintain its consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the term loan facility above a certain minimum dollar amount and comply with certain other financial covenants this minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant may limit the ability of this subsidiary as well as other subsidiaries that are owned by this subsidiary to provide funds to us in order to pay dividends and other distributions on our common stock including the shares of common stock offered hereby and preferred stock and amounts due on our indebtedness any failure by this subsidiary to comply with these financial covenants will and any failure by this subsidiary to comply with other covenants in our 700 million term loan facility may result in an event of default under that facility which could have adverse consequences similar to those that may result from an event of default under our revolving credit facility as described above 

  

 24  

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities including 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 

·   requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 

·   limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

·   putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

  

if we default under a credit facility loan agreement or other debt instrument the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and in the case of secured indebtedness to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral 

  

in addition we have 16350000 shares of class f preferred stock outstanding the holders of which are entitled to receive before any dividends are paid on our common stock monthly dividends when as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us at the rate of 165625 per annum per share as a result we are subject to risks associated with preferred stock financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends on our preferred stock 

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control including 

  

·   prevailing interest rates increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities 

·   the market for similar securities issued by other reits 

·   general economic and financial market conditions 

·   the financial condition performance and prospects of us our tenants and our competitors 

·   changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations 

·   litigation and regulatory proceedings 

·   changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us our competitors or our industry 

·   changes in our credit ratings and 

·   actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors 

  

 25  

  

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the united states or us trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

  

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

·   adverse changes in general or local economic conditions 

·   changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties 

·   changes in interest rates and operating expenses 

·   competition for tenants 

·   changes in market rental rates 

·   inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases 

·   renewal of leases at lower rental rates 

·   inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship including bankruptcy 

·   changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate 

·   uninsured property liability 

·   property damage or casualty losses 

·   unexpected expenditures for capital improvements including requirements to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws 

·   the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties 

·   development oriented activities 

·   physical or weatherrelated damage to properties 

·   the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time 

·   acts of terrorism and war and 

·   acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

  

real estate property investments are illiquid therefore the company may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

we are engaged in the process of identifying analyzing underwriting and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions 

  

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

  

 26  

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

in addition although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects such as claims of ownership liens or other encumbrances there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property cause a financial misstatement or lead to reputational damage to the company 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

litigation risks could affect our business 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

  

 27  

  

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry 

  

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our tenants our business or the united states generally 

  

if events like these were to occur they could materially interrupt our business operations cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and maintenance of records which may include personal identifying information although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the theft of intellectual property personal information or personal property such as in the event of cyberattacks any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations result in theft of company assets damage our reputation subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last several years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably in addition the ongoing global financial crisis which includes concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar effect these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing unrest in certain middle eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent 

  

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement accuracy and safeguarding of assets any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports civil litigation or investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the financial accounting standards board or fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants 

  

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms 

campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company if we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future our business could be adversely affected as such activities could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties tenants and financing sources and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or existing sellers of properties tenants or financing sources choose to delay defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues then our results of operations could be adversely affected similarly we may suffer damage to our reputation for example regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities including the notes resulting in significant loss of value which could impact our ability to access capital increase our cost of capital and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms

our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock 

our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to among other purposes assist us in maintaining our status as a reit for united states federal andor state income tax purposes for example our charter restricts any person from acquiring actual or constructive ownership of more than 98 in value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock these restrictions could have antitakeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

realty income the monthly dividend company ®  is an sp 500 real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from our property portfolio we have inhouse acquisition portfolio management asset management credit research real estate research legal finance and accounting information technology and capital markets capabilities over the past 47 years realty income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under longterm net lease agreements 

  

realty income nyse o was founded in 1969 and listed on the new york stock exchange or nyse in 1994 we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

we seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio management asset management and the acquisition of additional properties 

  

at december 31 2015 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

·   of 4538 properties 

·   with an occupancy rate of 984 or 4467 properties leased and 71 properties available for lease 

·   leased to 240 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries 

·   located in 49 states and puerto rico 

·   with over 760 million square feet of leasable space and 

·   with an average leasable space per property of approximately 16750 square feet approximately 11550 square feet per retail property and 216550 square feet per industrial property 

  

of the 4538 properties in the portfolio 4519 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining are multitenant properties at december 31 2015 of the 4519 singletenant properties 4448 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 100 years 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our new 20 billion credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2015 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loans mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 485 billion or approximately 266 of our total market capitalization of 1822 billion 

  

 33  

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2015 as the sum of 

  

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 250416757 plus total common units outstanding of 648386 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 5163 per share on december 31 2015 or 1296 billion 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class f preferred stock of 4088 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 2380 million on our new credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 6377 million excluding net mortgage premiums of 91 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 3200 million on our term loans and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 365 billion excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 133 million 

  

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2015 we had 6377 million of mortgages payable all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions additionally at december 31 2015 we had net premiums totaling 91 million on these mortgages we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that will make it economically feasible to do so during 2015 we made 1984 million of principal payments including the repayment of 13 mortgages in full for 1910 million 

  

term loans 

in june 2015 in conjunction with entering into our new credit facility we entered into a 250 million senior unsecured term loan maturing june 30 2020 borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one month libor plus 095 in conjunction with this term loan we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 267 

  

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in january 2018 borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor plus 120 in conjunction with this term loan we also acquired an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 215 

  

20 billion revolving credit facility 

in june 2015 we entered into a new 2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility or our new credit facility which replaced our 15 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in may 2016 the initial term of our new credit facility expires in june 2019 and includes at our option two sixmonth extensions our new credit facility has a 10 billion accordion expansion option under our new credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at libor plus 09 with a facility commitment fee of 015 for allin drawn pricing of 105 over libor the borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor we also have other interest rate options available to us under our new credit facility our new credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2015 we had a borrowing capacity of 176 billion available on our new credit facility and an outstanding balance of 2380 million the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our new credit facility at december 31 2015 was 12 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2015 we remain in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our new credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms 

  

notes outstanding 

as of december 31 2015 we had 365 billion of senior unsecured note and bond obligations excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 133 million all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 

  

 34  

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 403 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our new credit facility 

  

acquisitions during 2015 

during 2015 we invested 126 billion in 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 66 the 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states will contain approximately 62 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 165 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 21 industries and the property types consist of 873 retail and 127 industrial based on rental revenue during 2015 none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2015 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 126 billion we invested during 2015 458 million was invested in 35 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 97 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  

portfolio discussion 

  

leasing results 

at december 31 2015 we had 71 properties available for lease out of 4538 properties in our portfolio which represents a 984 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio since december 31 2014 when we reported 70 properties available for lease out of 4327 and a 984 occupancy rate we 

  

·   had 283 lease expirations 

·   released 253 properties and 

·   sold 29 vacant properties 

  

of the 253 properties released during 2015 216 properties were released to existing tenants seven were released to new tenants without vacancy and 30 were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 253 leases was 3746 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 3712 million which represents a rent recapture rate of 1009 on the properties released during 2015 

  

at december 31 2015 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1331 per square foot on the 4467 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2015 we classified ten properties with a carrying amount of 98 million as held for sale on our balance sheet the expected disposal of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results 

  

 35  

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2015 we capitalized costs of 115 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 748000 for releasing costs 76 million for recurring capital expenditures and 32 million for nonrecurring building improvements in 2014 we capitalized costs of 60 million on existing properties in our portfolio 

  

as part of our releasing costs we typically pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

the majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 47year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2015 and two times during 2016 as of february 2016 we have paid 73 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 84 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 

  

   

the dividends paid per share during 2015 totaled approximately 22714167 as compared to approximately 21916254 during 2014 an increase of 00798 or 36 

  

the monthly dividend of 01985 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2382 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 43 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 5579 on january 29 2016 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

universal shelf registration 

in december 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in december 2018 this replaced our prior shelf registration statement in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

  

 36  

  

issuance of common stock 

in october 2015 we issued 11500000 shares of common stock including 1500000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of 220 million a portion of the net proceeds of 5171 million was used to repay borrowings under our new credit facility and the remaining portion was used for other general corporate purposes including acquisitions 

  

in april 2015 we issued 5500000 shares of common stock after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of 14 million the net proceeds of 2764 million were used to repay borrowings under our previous 15 billion unsecured credit facility 

  

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or the drspp provides our common stockholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions the drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions the drspp authorizes up to 26000000 common shares to be issued in 2013 we revised our drspp so that we would pay for a majority of the planrelated fees which were previously paid by investors and to institute a waiver approval process allowing larger investors or institutions per a formal approval process to purchase shares at a small discount if approved by us during 2015 we issued 7608354 shares and raised approximately 3630 million under the drspp of which 7413207 shares and 3537 million was raised under the waiver approval process 

  

atthemarket atm program 

in september 2015 we established an “at the market” equity distribution program or our atm program pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to 12000000 shares of common stock to or through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the nyse or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices during 2015 we issued 714301 shares and raised approximately 363 million under the atm program 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our new credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a “stable” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook to our senior notes and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our current ratings the current facility interest rate is libor plus 09 with a facility commitment fee of 015 for allin drawn pricing of 105 over libor our new credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 155 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii libor plus 085 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 03 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 or unrated and ii 0125 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

 37  

  

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2015 sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 

  

   

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants which we remain in compliance with at december 31 2015 additionally interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 

  

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds these calculations which are not based on us gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2015 are 

  

   

1 this covenant is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding fourquarter period on the assumptions that i the incurrence of any debt as defined in the covenants incurred by us since the first day of such fourquarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom including to refinance other debt since the first day of such fourquarter period ii the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such fourquarter period and iii any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on january 1 2015 and subject to certain additional adjustments such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses i ii and iii of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1 2015 nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period the following is our calculation of debt service coverage at december 31 2015 in thousands for trailing twelve months 

  

   

 38  

  

fixed charge coverage ratio 

fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as the debt service coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator similar to debt service coverage ratio we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculations of both debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios may be different from the calculations used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited the presentation of debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios should not be considered as alternatives to any us gaap operating performance measures below is our calculation of fixed charges at december 31 2015 in thousands for the trailing twelve months

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straightline method over an estimated useful life of 25 to 35 years for buildings and 4 to 20 years for improvements which we believe are appropriate estimates of useful life if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when acquiring a property for investment purposes we typically allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value of inplace leases the value of inplace leases and tenant relationships as applicable in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the market where the property is located in addition any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors such as industry type tenant investment grade maturity date and comparable borrowings for similar assets the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period which does not exceed one year the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods historical sales and releases capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

  

rental revenue 

rental revenue was 9769 million for 2015 as compared to 8935 million for 2014 an increase of 834 million or 93 rental revenue was 7482 million for 2013 the increase in rental revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to 

  

·   the 248 properties 56 million square feet we acquired in 2015 which generated 419 million of rent in 2015 

·   the 479 properties 93 million square feet we acquired in 2014 which generated 993 million of rent in 2015 compared to 659 million in 2014 an increase of 334 million 

·   same store rents generated on 3636 properties 581 million square feet during 2015 and 2014 increased by 102 million or 13 to 7944 million from 7842 million 

·   a net increase in straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to rent of 40 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 

·   a net decrease of 84 million relating to properties sold in 2015 and during 2014 that were reported in continuing operations and 

·   a net increase of 23 million relating to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 137 properties comprising 12 million square feet that were available for lease during part of 2015 or 2014 ii rental revenue for 22 properties under development and iii lease termination settlements in aggregate the revenues for these items totaled 265 million in 2015 compared to 242 million in 2014 

  

for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were vacant at any time ii were under development or redevelopment and iii were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

  

of the 4538 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2015 4519 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining are multitenant properties of the 4519 singletenant properties 4448 or 984 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 100 years at december 31 2015 of our 4448 leased singletenant properties 3938 or 885 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

·   base rent increases tied to a consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 

·   percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales 

·   fixed increases or 

·   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 45 million in 2015 36 million in 2014 and 29 million in 2013 percentage rent in 2015 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2016 

  

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to regional and national tenants under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2015 our portfolio of 4538 properties was 984 leased with 71 properties available for lease as compared to 984 leased with 70 properties available for lease at december 31 2014 it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 

  

 41  

  

tenant reimbursements 

contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses were 420 million in 2015 compared to 371 million in 2014 and 249 million in 2013 the increase in tenant reimbursements is primarily due to our acquisitions during 2014 and 2015 our tenant reimbursements approximate our reimbursable property expenses for any given period 

  

other revenue 

other revenue which comprises propertyrelated revenue not included in rental revenue or tenant reimbursements was 44 million in 2015 compared to 29 million in 2014 and 70 million in 2013 

  

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 4092 million for 2015 compared to 3747 million for 2014 and 3068 million for 2013 the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2014 and 2015 which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations ffo available to common stockholders” and “adjusted funds from operations affo available to common stockholders” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo 

  

interest expense 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

the increase in interest expense from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to the june 2014 issuance of our 388 senior unsecured notes due july 2024 the september 2014 issuance of our 4125 senior unsecured notes due october 2026 the interest expense on the 250 million term loan that was entered into during june 2015 and the payoff of mortgages during 2015 which reduced the amortization of net mortgage premiums additionally each quarter we adjust the carrying value of our interest rate swaps to fair value changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded directly to interest expense we recorded a loss on interest rate swaps of 30 million and 13 million during 2015 and 2014 respectively and a gain on interest rate swaps of 878000 during 2013 

  

the increase in interest expense from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the july 2013 issuance of our 465 senior unsecured notes due august 2023 the june 2014 issuance of our 388 senior unsecured notes due july 2024 the september 2014 issuance of our 4125 senior unsecured notes due october 2026 and an increase in mortgages payable the increase was partially offset by slightly lower average interest rates and the repayment of our 5375 senior unsecured notes in march 2013 

  

at december 31 2015 the weighted average interest rate on our 

·   notes and bonds payable of 365 billion excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 133 million was 47 

  

 42  

  

·   mortgages payable of 6377 million excluding net premiums totaling 91 million on these mortgages was 50 

·   credit facility outstanding borrowings of 2380 million was 12 

·   term loans outstanding borrowings of 3200 million was 12 and 

·   combined outstanding notes bonds mortgages term loan and credit facility borrowings of 485 billion was 44 

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses decreased by 18 million to 493 million for 2015 compared to 511 million in 2014 general and administrative expenses were 569 million in 2013 included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs of 913000 for 2015 453000 for 2014 and 21 million for 2013 general and administrative expenses slightly decreased during 2015 primarily due to lower compensation costs lower corporate insurance premiums and lower proxy costs general and administrative expenses decreased during 2014 primarily due to lower stock compensation costs including the 37 million for accelerated vesting that occurred in july 2013 and lower acquisition transaction costs in january 2016 we had 132 employees as compared to 125 employees in january 2015 and 116 employees in january 2014 

  

   

1 excludes all tenant reimbursements revenue as well as revenue included in discontinued operations and gain on sales 

  

property expenses including tenant reimbursable expenses 

property expenses consist of costs associated with unleased properties leased properties and general portfolio expenses as well as contractually obligated reimbursable costs from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses expenses related to unleased properties and expenses we are responsible for on some of the leased properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio expenses include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2015 71 properties were available for lease as compared to 70 properties at december 31 2014 and 70 properties at december 31 2013 

  

property expenses were 554 million including 420 million in reimbursable expenses in 2015 and 539 million including 371 million in reimbursable expenses in 2014 and 389 million including 249 million in reimbursable expenses in 2013 the increase in gross property expenses in 2015 is primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size which contributed to higher contractually obligated reimbursements primarily due to our acquisitions during 2014 and 2015 

  

while the gross property expenses have increased our net property expenses net of tenant reimbursements has decreased during 2015 as compared to 2014 the net expenses have decreased primarily due to lower portfolio vacancy lower property insurance premiums and fewer onetime maintenance expenses 

  

   

1 excludes all tenant reimbursements revenue as well as revenue included in discontinued operations and gain on sales 

  

income taxes 

income taxes were 32 million in 2015 compared to 35 million in 2014 and 24 million in 2013 these amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income and its subsidiaries the increase for 2014 is primarily related to higher city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income and its subsidiaries primarily related to increased portfolio size 

  

 43  

  

provisions for impairment 

in 2015 we recorded total provisions for impairment of 106 million on three properties classified as held for sale four properties classified as held for investment seven sold properties and one property disposed of other than by sale these properties were not previously classified as held for sale in financial statements issued prior to the date of adoption of accounting standards update asu 201408 which amends topic 205 presentation of financial statements  and topic 360 property plant and equipment  accordingly the provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2015 

  

in 2014 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 46 million provisions for impairment of 41 million are included in income from continuing operations on nine sold properties and two properties classified as held for investment these properties were not previously classified as held for sale in financial statements issued prior to the date of adoption of asu 201408 accordingly these provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income additionally a provision for impairment of 510000 is included in income from discontinued operations on one sold property that was classified as held for sale as of december 31 2013 

  

in 2013 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 30 million realty income recorded provisions for impairment of 27 million in income from discontinued operations on seven sold properties except for a provision for impairment of 290000 that was recorded in income from continuing operations for one property that was not previously classified as held for sale as of december 31 2013 the remaining provisions for impairment are included in income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income in 2013 crest also recorded a provision for impairment of 308000 on one sold property which is included in income from discontinued operations 

  

mergerrelated costs 

mergerrelated costs include but are not limited to advisor fees legal fees accounting fees printing fees and transfer taxes related to our acquisition of arct mergerrelated costs were 130 million in 2013 on a diluted per common share basis these expenses represented 007 for 2013 no mergerrelated costs were incurred in 2014 or 2015 

  

gain on sales of real estate 

during 2015 we sold 38 investment properties for 658 million which resulted in a gain of 222 million the results of operations for these properties are presented within continuing operations 

  

during 2014 we sold 46 investment properties for 1072 million which resulted in a gain of 421 million only the results of operations specifically related to the properties classified as held for sale at december 31 2013 and sold during 2014 were reclassified as discontinued operations 

  

during 2013 we sold 75 investment properties for 1342 million which resulted in a gain of 647 million the results of operations for these properties were reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

during 2015 crest did not sell any properties crest sold one property for 820000 and one property for 597000 during 2014 and 2013 respectively neither of these sales resulted in a gain the results of operations for these properties were reclassified as discontinued operations 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

·   generate higher returns 

·   enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

·   extend our average remaining lease term or 

·   decrease tenant or industry concentration 

  

at december 31 2015 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 98 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2016 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately 50 to 75 million in yet to be identified property sales for all of 2016 we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available 

  

 44  

  

however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock dividends totaled 271 million in 2015 371 million in 2014 and 419 million in 2013 

  

excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

in october 2014 we redeemed all 8800000 shares of our 675 monthly income class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock or the class e preferred stock for 2500 per share plus accrued dividends we incurred a noncash charge of 60 million this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 2567 million in 2015 compared to 2276 million in 2014 an increase of 291 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 109 in 2015 as compared to 104 in 2014 an increase of 005 or 48 net income available to common stockholders was 2036 million in 2013 or 106 on a diluted per common share basis net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 net income available to common stockholders for 2013 was impacted by an unusually large gain on property sales which represents 018 on a diluted per common share basis additionally net income available to common stockholders for 2013 includes 130 million of mergerrelated costs for the acquisition of arct which represents 007 on a diluted per common share basis and 37 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from tenyear vesting to five years which represents 002 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments andor gains from the sale of properties the amount of impairments andor gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

gains from the sale of properties during 2015 were 222 million as compared to gains from the sale of properties of 421 million during 2014 

  

discontinued operations 

during the first quarter of 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that changed the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results we early adopted the requirements of this accounting pronouncement in the first quarter of 2014 starting with the first quarter of 2014 the results of operations for all qualifying disposals and properties classified as held for sale that were not previously reported in discontinued operations in our 2013 annual report on form 10k are presented within income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income for 2014 we recorded income from discontinued operations of 28 million or 001 per common share basic and diluted for 2013 we recorded income from discontinued operations of 657 million or 034 per common share basic and diluted 

  

 45  

  

funds from operations ffo available to common stockholders 

  

in 2015 our ffo increased by 895 million or 159 to 6524 million compared to 5629 million in 2014 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 277 in 2015 compared to 258 in 2014 an increase of 019 or 74 in 2013 ffo was 4620 million or 241 on a diluted per common share basis our ffo in 2014 included a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 ffo in 2013 was normalized to exclude 130 million of mergerrelated costs which represents 007 on a diluted per common share basis for 2013 ffo for 2013 includes 37 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from tenyear vesting to five years which represents 002 on a diluted per common share basis all references to ffo for 2013 reflect the adjustments for mergerrelated costs for the acquisition of arct 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

1 ffo for 2013 has been normalized to exclude arct mergerrelated costs 

  

2 the computation of diluted ffo does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible to common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted ffo per share in a given period 

  

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trusts’ definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets reduced by gains on property sales and extraordinary items 

  

 46  

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our new credit facility 

  

adjusted funds from operations affo available to common stockholders 

  

in 2015 our affo increased by 853 million or 152 to 6470 million compared to 5617 million in 2014 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 274 in 2015 compared to 257 in 2014 an increase of 017 or 66 in 2013 affo was 4631 million or 241 on a diluted per common share basis we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term “cad” for cash available for distribution “fad” for funds available for distribution or other terms 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

1   see reconciling items for ffo presented under “funds from operations ffo available to common stockholders” 

  

2   includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized upon issuance of our notes payable assumption of our mortgages payable and upon issuance of our term loans the deferred financing costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages and term loans no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

  

3   includes adjustments allocable to both noncontrolling interests and capital lease obligations 

  

4   the computation of diluted affo does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible to common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted affo per share in a given period 

  

 47  

  

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

  

presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

  

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings or fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

of our 4538 properties in our portfolio approximately 980 or 4467 are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our new credit facility term loans mortgages payable and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

  

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

 48  

  

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2015 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  

expected maturity data 

  

   

1   excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable and original issuance discounts recorded on notes payable at december 31 2015 the unamortized balance of net premiums on mortgages payable was 91 million and the unamortized balance of original issuance discounts on notes payable was 133 million 

  

2   we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes and bonds at december 31 2015 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at december 31 2015 on the relevant treasury yield curve plus an applicable creditadjusted spread we believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance and term loans balance reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at december 31 2015 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2015 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates all of our mortgages payable except four mortgages totaling 511 million at december 31 2015 including net unamortized discounts have fixed interest rates after factoring in arrangements that limit our exposure to interest rate risk and effectively fix our per annum interest rates our variable rate mortgage debt includes two mortgages totaling 155 million at december 31 2015 interest on our new credit facility and term loan balances is variable however the variable interest rate feature on our term loans has been mitigated by interest rate swap agreements based on our new credit facility balance of 2380 million at december 31 2015 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 24 million per year

 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

of the 4327 properties in the portfolio 4308 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining nineteen are multitenant properties at december 31 2014 of the 4308 singletenant properties 4238 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 102 years 

  

our nine senior officers owned 03 of our outstanding common stock with a market value of 311 million at january 31 2015 our directors and nine senior officers as a group owned 04 of our outstanding common stock with a market value of 464 million at january 31 2015

in january 2015 we had 125 employees as compared to 116 employees in january 2014

recent developments 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 46year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend four times during 2014 and two times during 2015 as of february 2015 we have paid 69 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 79 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 

  

   

the dividends paid per share during 2014 as compared to 2013 increased 21 the 2014 dividends paid per share totaled 21916254 as compared to 21474587 in 2013 an increase of 00441667 

  

the monthly dividend of 0189 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2268 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 42 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 5431 on january 31 2015 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

acquisitions during 2014 

during 2014 we invested 14 billion in 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 71 the 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 42 states will contain approximately 98 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 128 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 32 industries and the property types consist of 857 retail 66 industrial and distribution 64 office and 13 manufacturing based on rental revenue during 2014 none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 100 or more of our total assets at december 31 2014 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent under the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 14 billion we invested during 2014 819 million was invested in 40 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 84 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  

  

portfolio discussion 

  

leasing results 

at december 31 2014 we had 70 properties available for lease out of 4327 properties in our portfolio which represents a 984 occupancy rate since december 31 2013 when we reported 70 properties available for lease out of 3896 and a 982 occupancy rate we 

  

·   had 220 lease expirations 

·   released 203 properties and 

·   sold 17 vacant properties 

  

of the 203 properties released during 2014 173 properties were released to existing tenants nine were released to new tenants without vacancy and 21 were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 203 leases was 339 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 342 million 

  

at december 31 2014 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1307 per square foot on the 4257 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2014 we classified eight properties with a carrying amount of 148 million as held for sale on our balance sheet the disposal of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2014 we capitalized costs of 60 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 821000 for releasing costs and 52 million for building and tenant improvements in 2013 we capitalized costs of 85 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 13 million for releasing costs and 72 million for building and tenant improvements 

  

as part of our releasing costs we typically pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

the majority of our building and tenant improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

note issuance 

in september 2014 we issued 250 million of 4125 senior unsecured notes due october 2026 or the 2026 notes the price to the investors for the 2026 notes was 99499 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 4178 per annum a portion of the total net proceeds of approximately 2464 million from this offering was used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and the remaining proceeds were used for other general corporate purposes and working capital including additional property acquisitions 

  

in june 2014 we issued 350 million of 3875 senior unsecured notes due july 2024 or the 2024 notes the price to the investors for the 2024 notes was 99956 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 388 per annum the total net proceeds of approximately 3467 million from this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility 

  

redemption of preferred stock 

in october 2014 we redeemed all 8800000 shares of our 675 monthly income class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock or the class e preferred stock for 2500 per share plus accrued dividends we incurred a noncash charge of 60 million this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 

  

  

issuance of common stock 

in april 2014 we issued 13800000 shares of common stock including 1800000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of 228 million the net proceeds of 5286 million were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility 

  

modifications to compensation program 

in april 2014 the compensation committee of the board of directors made modifications to the existing compensation program the modified compensation program now consists of distinct shortterm and longterm incentive plans based on separate metrics the redesigned shortterm incentive plan includes a mix of cash and equity awards under the longterm incentive plan awards are granted in performancevesting equity awards which vest based strictly on achieving future performance goals with respect to the performance based restricted shares the award is based on objective performance metrics and determined primarily by relative stockholder return metrics with a smaller component based on balance sheet metrics as part of this new program the compensation committee of the board of directors granted performancevesting shares with an approximate grant date fair value of 30 million to our executive officers in april 2014 

  

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

in march 2011 we established a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or the drspp to provide our common stockholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions the drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions the drspp authorizes up to 6000000 common shares to be issued during 2014 we issued 3527166 shares and raised approximately 1585 million under the drspp 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 2276 million in 2014 compared to 2036 million in 2013 an increase of 240 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 104 in 2014 as compared to 106 in 2013 a decrease of 002 or 19 net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 net income available to common stockholders for 2013 was impacted by an unusually large gain on property sales which represents 018 on a diluted per common share basis additionally net income available to common stockholders for 2013 includes 130 million of mergerrelated costs for the acquisition of american realty capital trust inc or arct which represents 007 on a diluted per common share basis and 37 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from tenyear vesting to five years which represents 002 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

gains from the sale of properties during 2014 were 421 million as compared to gains from the sale of properties of 647 million during 2013 

  

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

in 2014 our ffo increased by 1009 million or 218 to 5629 million versus 4620 million in 2013 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 258 in 2014 compared to 241 in 2013 an increase of 017 or 71 ffo in 2014 includes a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 ffo in 2013 was normalized to exclude 130 million of mergerrelated costs which represents 007 on a diluted per common share basis ffo for 2013 includes 37 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from tenyear vesting to five years which represents 002 on a diluted per common share basis all references to ffo for 2013 reflect the adjustments for mergerrelated costs for the acquisition of arct 

  

  

see our discussion of ffo which is not a financial measure under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo 

  

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

in 2014 our affo increased by 986 million or 213 to 5617 million versus 4631 million in 2013 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 257 in 2014 compared to 241 in 2013 an increase of 016 or 66 

  

see our discussion of affo which is not a financial measure under gaap in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and affo 

  

dividend policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock and class f preferred stock if and when declared by our board of directors 

  

distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of tau operating partnership lp and realty income lp each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders 

  

in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2014 our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled 5191 million or approximately 1546 of our estimated taxable income of 3357 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our 2014 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 4793 million representing 853 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 5617 million 

  

the class f preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6625 per annum on the 2500 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 165625 per annum per share dividends on our class f preferred stock are current 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year 

  

  

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 248 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2014 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we estimate that in 2015 between 20 and 35 of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital 

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

investment philosophy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on 1 increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 2 fixed increases or 3 additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm net leases generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy we believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant industry geography and to a certain extent property type leads to more predictable investment results for our shareholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration our investment efforts have led to a diversified property portfolio that as of december 31 2014 consisted of 4327 properties located in 49 states and puerto rico leased to 234 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 industry segments each of the 47 industry segments represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for no more than 100 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2014 since 1970 our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 however we cannot assure you that our future occupancy levels will continue to exceed 96 

  

investment strategy 

our investment strategy is to act as a source of capital to regional and national tenants by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations when identifying new properties for investment we generally focus on acquiring the real estate tenants consider important to the successful operation of their business we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

  

·   properties that are freestanding commerciallyzoned with a single tenant 

·   properties that are in significant markets or strategic locations critical to generating revenue for regional and national tenants ie they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business 

·   properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants andor can generally be characterized as important to the operations of the company’s business 

·   properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our tenants and have good visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares 

·   properties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs 

·   properties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents and 

·   properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm net lease agreements offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases 

  

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national tenants are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale strong consumer brands advertising and the selection of prime locations in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of singletenant properties net leased to different tenants in a variety of industries we have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities often using our relationships with various tenants ownersdevelopers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions we also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment this research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value 

  

  

in selecting potential investments we look for tenants with the following attributes 

  

·   tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow 

·   tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources 

·   tenants that are willing to sign a longterm lease 10 or more years and 

·   tenants that are large owners and users of real estate 

  

from a retail perspective our investment strategy is to target tenants that have a service nondiscretionary andor lowpricepoint component to their business we believe these characteristics better position tenants to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers as a result of the execution of this strategy over 90 of our retail rental is derived from tenants with a service nondiscretionary andor low price point component to their business from a nonretail perspective we target industrial and distribution properties leased to fortune 1000 primarily investmentgraderated companies we believe rental revenue generated from businesses with these characteristics is generally more durable and stable 

  

after applying this investment strategy we pursue those transactions where we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable riskadjusted return 

  

underwriting strategy 

we believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligation is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive and in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

  

in order to be considered for acquisition properties must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit criteria we have established a fourpart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

  

·   industry company market conditions and credit profile 

·   store profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available 

·   overall real estate characteristics including property value and comparative rental rates and 

·   the importance of the real estate location to the operations of the tenants’ business 

  

prior to entering into any transaction our investment professionals assisted by our research department conduct a review of a tenant’s credit quality the information reviewed may include reports and filings including any public credit ratings financial statements debt and equity analyst reports and reviews of corporate credit spreads stock prices market capitalization and other financial metrics we conduct additional due diligence including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates we continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed and providing summaries of these findings to management we estimate that approximately 46 of our annualized rental revenue comes from properties leased to investment grade companies or their subsidiaries at december 31 2014 our top 20 tenants represent approximately 53 of our annualized revenue and nine of these tenants have investment grade credit ratings 

  

asset management strategy 

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing the credit quality of our portfolio 

  

  

we regularly review and analyze 

  

·   the performance of the various industries of our tenants 

·   the operation management business planning and financial condition of our tenants and 

·   the quality of the underlying real estate locations 

  

we have an active asset management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

·   generate higher returns 

·   enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

·   extend our average remaining lease term or 

·   decrease tenant or industry concentration 

  

at december 31 2014 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 148 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2015 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately 50 million in property sales for all of 2015 we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our 15 billion credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2014 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loan mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 493 billion or approximately 306 of our total market capitalization of 1611 billion 

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2014 as the sum of 

  

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 224881192 plus total common units of 816568 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 4771 per share on december 31 2014 or 1077 billion 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class f preferred stock of 4088 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 2230 million on our credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 8360 million excluding net mortgage premiums of 166 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 700 million on our term loan and

15 billion acquisition credit facility 

we have a 15 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility with an initial term that expires in may 2016 and includes at our election a oneyear extension option under this credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling we also have other interest rate options available to us under this credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2014 we had a borrowing capacity of 128 billion available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 2230 million the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2014 was 12 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2014 we remain in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter when capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 39 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

  

credit agency ratings

based on our current ratings the current facility interest rate is libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 basis points over libor the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 185 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 and ii libor plus 100 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 045 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 and ii 015 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

this “risk factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders” unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock 

  

  

in order to grow w e need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

we face competition in the acquisition and operation of property we expect competition from 

  

·   businesses 

  

·   individuals 

  

·   fiduciary accounts and plans and 

  

·   other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

  

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

  

·   lack of demand in areas where our properties are located 

  

·   inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants 

  

·   oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates 

  

·   declines in our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent which may be affected by their operations the current economic situation and competition within their industries from other operators 

  

·   defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations 

  

·   economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located and 

  

·   deterioration of the physical condition of our properties 

  

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us 

  

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against the tenant for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of tenant’s leases that are not terminated as a result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect cash from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness 

  

  

seventy of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2014 all of which were singletenant properties at december 31 2014 thirtynine of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2014 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

individually each of the industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2014 nevertheless downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common and preferred stock 

  

in addition some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have more limited financial and other resources and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional national or international economy 

  

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant net lease retail locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states and properties leased to tenants engaged in nonretail businesses for example our acquisition of arct included tenants in the aerospace freight governmental services healthcare home maintenance manufacturing pharmacy retail banking technology and telecommunications businesses some of which are nonretail businesses and none of which was in an industry segment that was within our property portfolio prior to our acquisition of arct these risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties new types of real estate locations and lease structures and the laws and culture of any nonus jurisdiction 

  

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

  

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

·   our knowledge of the contamination 

  

·   the timing of the contamination 

  

·   the cause of the contamination or 

  

·   the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings with asbestos in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately 

  

  

inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation andor that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of tenants’ activities on the properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements obtaining environmental insurance or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation however it is possible that one or more of our tenants could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities 

  

compliance   we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to liability including strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

  

insurance and indemnity   in july 2012 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in july 2022 and replaced our previous sevenyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 60 million in the aggregate the limits on the excess policy are 5 million per occurrence and 10 million in the aggregate therefore the primary and excess tenyear policies together provide a total limit of 15 million per occurrence and 70 million in the aggregate 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

  

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

  

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

  

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

·   we would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

  

·   we would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income 

  

·   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

  

·   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

  

·   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that under certain circumstances may 

  

  

be exchanged for shares of our common stock this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of or refinance the debt on the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain similarly we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 15 billion acquisition credit facility at december 31 2014 we had 2230 million of outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility a total of 38 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 146 million 70 million of borrowings outstanding under a senior unsecured term loan and approximately 8360 million of outstanding mortgage debt excluding net premiums totaling 166 million on these mortgages to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our acquisition credit facility our term loan and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our acquisition credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

  

in addition our acquisition credit facility term loan facility and mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our acquisition credit facility provides that if an event of default as defined in the credit facility exists neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make any dividends or other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

  

·   the sum of a 95 of our adjusted funds from operations as defined by the credit facility agreement for that period plus b the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period and 

  

·   the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our shareholders in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

  

except that we may repurchase or redeem preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock the acquisition credit facility further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to any of our subsidiaries that have guaranteed amounts payable under the credit facility or that meet a significance test set forth in the credit facility we and our subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under our acquisition credit facility were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or prevent us from paying those dividends or other distributions altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit likewise one of our subsidiaries is the borrower under our 70 million term loan facility and that facility requires that this subsidiary maintain its consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the term loan facility above a certain minimum dollar amount and comply with certain other financial covenants this minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant may limit the ability of this subsidiary as well as other subsidiaries that are owned by this subsidiary to provide funds to us in order to pay dividend and other distributions on our common stock including the shares of common stock offered hereby and preferred stock and amounts due on our indebtedness any failure by this subsidiary to comply with these financial covenants will and any failure by this subsidiary to comply with other covenants in the term loan facility may result in an event of default under that facility which could have adverse consequences similar to those that may result from an event of default under our acquisition credit facility as described above 

  

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock and debt securities including 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

  

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 

  

·   requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 

  

·   limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

  

·   putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

  

if we default under a loan agreement or other debt instrument the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal of and interest on their loan and in the case of secured indebtedness to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral 

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control including 

  

·   prevailing interest rates increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities 

  

·   the market for similar securities issued by other reits 

  

·   general economic and financial market conditions 

  

·   the financial condition performance and prospects of us our tenants and our competitors 

  

·   changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations 

  

·   litigation and regulatory proceedings 

  

·   changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us our competitors or our industry 

  

·   changes in our credit ratings and 

  

·   actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors 

  

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the us trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

·   adverse changes in general or local economic conditions 

  

·   changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties 

  

·   changes in interest rates and operating expenses 

  

  

·   competition for tenants 

  

·   changes in market rental rates 

  

·   inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases 

  

·   renewal of leases at lower rental rates 

  

·   inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship including bankruptcy 

  

·   changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate 

  

·   uninsured property liability 

  

·   property damage or casualty losses 

  

·   unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws 

  

·   the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties 

  

·   physical or weatherrelated damage to properties 

  

·   the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time 

  

·   acts of terrorism and war and 

  

·   acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

  

real estate property investments are illiquid therefore the company may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations 

we are engaged in the process of identifying analyzing underwriting and negotiating possible acquisition transactions we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position andor results of operations including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions 

  

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our 

  

  

results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

in addition although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects such as claims of ownership liens or other encumbrances there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property cause a financial misstatement or lead to reputational damage to the company 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

litigation risks could affect our business 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

  

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry 

  

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

natural disasters terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our tenants our business or the united states generally 

  

  

if events like these were to occur they could materially interrupt our business operations cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and maintenance of records which may include personal identifying information although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the theft of intellectual property personal information or personal property such as in the event of cyberattacks any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations result in theft of company assets damage our reputation subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last several years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably in addition the ongoing global financial crisis which includes concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar effect these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing unrest in certain middle eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

  

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent 

  

  

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement accuracy and safeguarding of assets any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports civil litigation or investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the financial accounting standards board or fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants 

  

our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms 

campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company if we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future our business could be adversely affected as such activities could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties tenants and financing sources and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or existing sellers of properties tenants or financing sources choose to delay defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues then our results of operations could be adversely affected similarly we may suffer damage to our reputation for example regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities including the notes resulting in significant loss of value which could impact our ability to access capital increase our cost of capital and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operati ons 

  

general 

  

realty income the monthly dividend company ®  is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from our property portfolio we have inhouse acquisition portfolio management asset management credit research real estate research legal finance and accounting information technology and capital markets capabilities over the past 46 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under longterm net lease agreements 

  

realty income nyse o was founded in 1969 and in 1994 was listed on the nyse we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

we seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 

  

at december 31 2014 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

·   of 4327 properties 

·   with an occupancy rate of 984 or 4257 properties leased and 70 properties available for lease 

·   leased to 234 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries 

·   located in 49 states and puerto rico 

·   with over 707 million square feet of leasable space and 

·   with an average leasable space per property of approximately 16350 square feet including approximately 11290 square feet per retail property 

  

of the 4327 properties in the portfolio 4308 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining are multitenant properties at december 31 2014 of the 4308 singletenant properties 4238 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 102 years 

  

liquidity and capital resour ces 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our 15 billion credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2014 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loan mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 493 billion or approximately 306 of our total market capitalization of 1611 billion 

  

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2014 as the sum of 

  

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 224881192 plus total common units of 816568 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 4771 per share on december 31 2014 or 1077 billion 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class f preferred stock of 4088 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 2230 million on our credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 8360 million excluding net mortgage premiums of 166 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 700 million on our term loan and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 38 billion excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 146 million 

  

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2014 we had 8360 million of mortgages payable all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions additionally at december 31 2014 we had net premiums totaling 166 million on these mortgages 

  

we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that will make it economically feasible to do so during 2014 we made 852 million of principal payments including the repayment of six mortgages in full for 778 million 

  

term loan 

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in january 2018 borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor plus 120 in conjunction with this term loan we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 215 

  

15 billion acquisition credit facility 

we have a 15 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility with an initial term that expires in may 2016 and includes at our election a oneyear extension option under this credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling we also have other interest rate options available to us under this credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2014 we had a borrowing capacity of 128 billion available on our credit facility subject to customary conditions to borrowing and an outstanding balance of 2230 million the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2014 was 12 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2014 we remain in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter when capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

notes outstanding 

as of december 31 2014 we had 38 billion of senior unsecured note and bond obligations excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 146 million all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 

  

  

in september 2014 we issued 250 million of 4125 senior unsecured notes due october 2026 or the 2026 notes the price to the investors for the 2026 notes was 99499 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 4178 per annum a portion of the total net proceeds of approximately 2464 million from this offering was used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and the remaining proceeds were used for other general corporate purposes and working capital including additional property acquisitions 

  

in june 2014 we issued 350 million of 3875 senior unsecured notes due july 2024 or the 2024 notes the price to the investors for the 2024 notes was 99956 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 388 per annum the total net proceeds of approximately 3467 million from this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility 

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 39 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

acquisitions during 2014 

during 2014 we invested 14 billion in 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 71 the 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 42 states will contain approximately 98 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 128 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 32 industries and the property types consist of 857 retail 66 industrial and distribution 64 office and 13 manufacturing based on rental revenue none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2014 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent under the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income determined by the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs of the 14 billion we invested during 2014 819 million was invested in 40 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 84 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  

portfolio discussion 

  

leasing results 

at december 31 2014 we had 70 properties available for lease out of 4327 properties in our portfolio which represents a 984 occupancy rate since december 31 2013 when we reported 70 properties available for lease out of 3896 and a 982 occupancy rate we 

  

·   had 220 lease expirations 

·   released 203 properties and 

·   sold 17 vacant properties 

  

  

of the 203 properties released during 2014 173 properties were released to existing tenants nine were released to new tenants without vacancy and 21 were released to new tenants after a period of vacancy the annual rent on these 203 leases was 339 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 342 million 

  

at december 31 2014 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1307 per square foot on the 4257 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2014 we classified eight properties with a carrying amount of 148 million as held for sale on our balance sheet the disposal of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2014 we capitalized costs of 60 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 821000 for releasing costs and 52 million for building and tenant improvements in 2013 we capitalized costs of 85 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 13 million for releasing costs and 72 million for building and tenant improvements 

  

as part of our releasing costs we typically pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

the majority of our building and tenant improvements relate to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly see our discussion of “risk factors” in this annual report 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 46year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend four times during 2014 and two times during 2015 as of february 2015 we have paid 69 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 79 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994 

  

   

the dividends paid per share during 2014 as compared to 2013 increased 21 the 2014 dividends paid per share totaled 21916254 as compared to 21474587 in 2013 an increase of 00441667 

  

the monthly dividend of 0189 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2268 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 42 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 5431 on january 31 2015 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

  

universal shelf registration 

in february 2013 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in february 2016 this replaces our prior shelf registration statement in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

  

issuance of common stock 

in april 2014 we issued 13800000 shares of common stock including 1800000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of 228 million the net proceeds of 5286 million were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility 

  

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

in march 2011 we established a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or the drspp to provide our common stockholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions the drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions the drspp authorizes up to 6000000 common shares to be issued during 2014 we issued 3527166 shares and raised approximately 1585 million under the drspp 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a “stable” outlook standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook to our senior notes and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our current ratings the current facility interest rate is libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 185 if our credit rating is lower than bbbbaa3 and ii libor plus 100 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 045 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 and ii 015 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

  

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2014 sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 

  

   

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants which we remain in compliance with at december 31 2014 additionally interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 

  

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds these calculations which are not based on us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2014 are 

  

   

1 this covenant is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding fourquarter period on the assumption that i the incurrence of any debt as defined in the covenants incurred by us since the first day of such fourquarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom including to refinance other debt since the first day of such fourquarter period ii the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such fourquarter period and iii any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such fourquarters had in each case occurred on january 1 2014 and subject to certain additional adjustments such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses i ii and iii of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1 2014 nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period the following is our calculation of debt service coverage at december 31 2014 in thousands for trailing twelve months 

  

   

  

fixed charge coverage ratio 

fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as the debt service coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator similar to debt service coverage ratio we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculations of both debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios may be different from the calculations used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited the presentation of debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios should not be considered as alternatives to any us gaap operating performance measures below is our calculation of fixed charges at december 31 2014 in thousands for trailing twelve months 

  

   

table of obligations 

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2014 dollars in millions 

  

   

   

  

our credit facility and notes payable obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

  

preferred stock and preferred units outstanding 

in 2006 we issued 8800000 shares of class e preferred stock at a price of 2500 per share since december 2011 the shares of class e preferred stock were redeemable at our option for 2500 per share in october 2014 we redeemed all of the 8800000 shares of our class e preferred stock for 2500 per share plus accrued dividends we incurred a charge of 60 million representing the class e preferred stock original issuance costs that we paid in 2006 

  

in february 2012 we issued 1495 million shares of our class f preferred stock at 2500 per share in april 2012 we issued an additional 14 million shares of class f preferred stock at 252863 per share beginning february 15 2017 shares of our class f preferred stock are redeemable at our option for 2500 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on the shares of our class f preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears we are current on our obligations to pay dividends on our class f preferred stock 

  

  

as part of our acquisition of arct in january 2013 we issued 6750 partnership units with a carrying value of 675 million payments on these preferred units are made monthly in arrears at rate of 2 per annum or 135000 and are included in interest expense in january 2015 we redeemed all 6750 tau operating partnership preferred units for 1000 per unit plus accrued and unpaid dividends 

  

no unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated investments nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts 

  

results of operatio ns 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straightline method over an estimated useful life of 25 to 35 years for buildings and 4 to 15 years for improvements which we believe are appropriate estimates of useful life if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when acquiring a property for investment purposes we typically allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value of inplace leases the value of inplace leases and tenant relationships as applicable in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located in addition any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors such as industry type tenant investment grade maturity date and comparable borrowings for similar assets the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

  

rental revenue 

  

rental revenue was 8935 million for 2014 versus 7482 million for 2013 an increase of 1453 million or 194 rental revenue was 4670 million in 2012 the increase in rental revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to 

  

·   the 479 properties 93 million square feet acquired by realty income in 2014 which generated 660 million of rent in 2014 

·   the 957 properties 250 million square feet acquired by realty income in 2013 which generated 2849 million of rent in 2014 compared to 2131 million in 2013 an increase of 718 million 

·   same store rents generated on 2728 properties 337 million square feet during the entire years of 2014 and 2013 increased by 77 million or 15 to 5134 million from 5057 million 

·   a net increase in straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to rent of 14 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 

·   a net decrease of 17 million relating to properties sold in 2014 that were not previously classified as held for sale as of december 31 2013 and 

·   a net decrease of 193000 relating to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 154 properties comprising 14 million square feet that were available for lease during part of 2014 or 2013 ii rental revenue for nine properties under development and iii lease termination settlements which in aggregate totaled 170 million in 2014 compared to 172 million in 2013 

  

for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were vacant at any time ii were under development or redevelopment and iii were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced each of the exclusions from the same store pool is separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

  

of the 4327 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2014 4308 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining nineteen are multitenant properties of the 4308 singletenant properties 4238 or 984 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 102 years at december 31 2014 of our 4238 leased singletenant properties 3789 or 894 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

·   primarily base rent increases tied to a consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 

·   percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales 

·   fixed increases or 

·   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 36 million in 2014 28 million in 2013 and 19 million in 2012 excluding percentage rent reclassified to discontinued operations of 35000 in 2014 104000 in 2013 and 163000 in 2012 percentage rent in 2014 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2015 

  

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to regional and national tenants under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2014 our portfolio of 4327 properties was 984 leased with 70 properties available for lease as compared to 982 occupancy or 70 properties available for lease at december 31 2013 it has been our experience that approximately 2 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 

  

  

tenant reimbursements 

contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses were 371 million in 2014 compared to 249 million in 2013 and 146 million in 2012 the increase in tenant reimbursements from 2013 to 2014 is primarily due to our 2013 and 2014 acquisitions our tenant reimbursements are equal to our reimbursable property expenses for any given period 

  

other revenue 

other revenue which comprises propertyrelated revenue not included in rental revenue or tenant reimbursements was 29 million in 2014 compared to 70 million in 2013 and 29 million in 2012 

  

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 3747 million in 2014 compared to 3068 million in 2013 and 1475 million in 2012 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2014 and 2013 which was partially offset by property sales in those same years as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo” and “adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo 

  

interest expense 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

interest expense was 2164 million in 2014 compared to 1814 million in 2013 and 1231 million in 2012 the increase in interest expense from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the july 2013 issuance of our 465 senior unsecured notes due august 2023 the june 2014 issuance of our 388 senior unsecured notes due july 2024 the september 2014 issuance of our 4125 senior unsecured notes due october 2026 and an increase in mortgages payable the increase was partially offset by slightly lower average interest rates and the repayment of our 5375 senior unsecured notes in march 2013 

  

at december 31 2014 the weighted average interest rate on our 

·   notes and bonds payable of 38 billion excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 146 million was 48 

·   mortgages payable of 8360 million excluding net premiums totaling 166 million on these mortgages was 50 

·   credit facility outstanding borrowings of 2230 million was 12 

·   term loan outstanding borrowings of 700 million was 14 and 

·   combined outstanding notes bonds mortgages and credit facility borrowings of 493 billion was 46 

  

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses decreased by 58 million to 511 million in 2014 as compared to 569 million in 2013 general and administrative expenses were 381 million in 2012 included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs excluding arct mergerrelated costs of 453000 for 2014 21 million for 2013 and 24 million for 2012 general and administrative expenses decreased during 2014 primarily due to lower stock compensation costs including the 37 million for accelerated vesting that occurred in july 2013 and lower acquisition transaction costs in january 2015 we had 125 employees as compared to 116 employees in january 2014 and 97 employees in january 2013 

  

   

1   excludes all tenant reimbursements revenue as well as gain on sales and crest revenue included in discontinued operations 

  

property expenses including tenant reimbursable expenses 

property expenses consist of costs associated with unleased properties nonnet leased properties and general portfolio expenses as well as contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses expenses related to unleased properties and nonnet leased properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2014 70 properties were available for lease as compared to 70 at december 31 2013 and 84 at december 31 2012 

  

property expenses were 539 million including 371 million reimbursable in 2014 389 million including 249 million reimbursable in 2013 and 213 million including 146 million reimbursable in 2012 the increase in property expenses in 2014 is primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size which contributed to higher maintenance and utilities property taxes ground rent expenses legal costs and bad debt expense along with higher contractually obligated reimbursements primarily due to our 2013 and 2014 acquisitions partially offset by lower insurance costs 

  

income taxes 

income taxes were 35 million in 2014 as compared to 24 million in 2013 and 11 million in 2012 these amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income and its subsidiaries the increase for 2014 is primarily related to higher city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income and its subsidiaries primarily related to increased portfolio size 

  

provisions for impairment 

in 2014 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 46 million on nine sold properties and three properties classified as held for sale provisions for impairment of 41 million are included in income from continuing operations on eight sold properties and three properties classified as held for sale these properties were not previously classified as held for sale in our financial statements issued prior to the date of adoption of the new accounting requirements regarding discontinued operations accordingly these provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income a provision for impairment of 510000 is included in income from discontinued operations on one sold property that was classified as held for sale as of december 31 2013 

  

in 2013 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 30 million realty income recorded provisions for impairment of 27 million on seven sold properties except for a provision for impairment of 290000 that was recorded in income from continuing operations for one property that was not previously classified as held for sale as of december 31 2013 the remaining provisions for impairment are included in income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income 

  

in 2013 crest also recorded a provision for impairment of 308000 on one sold property which is included in income from discontinued operations 

  

  

in 2012 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 51 million realty income recorded provisions for impairment of 15 million on six sold properties except for a provisions for impairment of 36 million that was recorded in income from continuing operations on four properties that were not previously classified as held for sale as of december 31 2013 the remaining provisions for impairment are included in income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income 

  

mergerrelated costs 

mergerrelated costs include but are not limited to advisor fees legal fees accounting fees printing fees and transfer taxes related to our acquisition of arct mergerrelated costs were 130 million in 2013 and 79 million in 2012 on a diluted per common share basis these expenses represented 007 for 2013 and 006 for 2012 no mergerrelated costs were incurred in 2014 

  

gain on sales of real estate 

during 2014 we sold 46 investment properties for 1072 million which resulted in a gain of 421 million only the results of operations specifically related to the properties classified as held for sale at december 31 2013 and sold during the year have been reclassified as discontinued operations 

  

during 2013 we sold 75 investment properties for 1342 million which resulted in a gain of 647 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

during 2012 we sold 44 investment properties for 506 million which resulted in a gain of 99 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

crest sold one property for 820000 and one property for 597000 during 2014 and 2013 respectively neither of these sales resulted in a gain the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations during 2012 crest did not sell any properties 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

·   generate higher returns 

·   enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

·   extend our average remaining lease term or 

·   decrease tenant or industry concentration 

  

at december 31 2014 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 148 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2015 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately 50 million in yet to be identified property sales for all of 2015 we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

discontinued operations 

during the first quarter of 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that changes the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results we early adopted the requirements of this accounting pronouncement in the first quarter of 2014 as a result our results of operations for all disposals and properties classified as held for sale that were not previously reported in discontinued operations in our 2013 annual report on form 10k are presented within income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income 

  

operations from eight properties were classified as held for sale at december 31 2014 and are included in income from continuing operations the following is a summary of income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands 

  

  

   

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock dividends totaled 371 million in 2014 419 million in 2013 and 409 million in 2012 

  

excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

in october 2014 we redeemed all 8800000 shares of our class e preferred stock for 2500 per share plus accrued dividends we incurred a noncash charge of 60 million this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value and represents the class e preferred stock original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 

  

in march 2012 we redeemed all 5100000 shares of our 7375 monthly income class d preferred stock or the class d preferred stock for 2500 per share plus accrued dividends we incurred a noncash charge of 37 million this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value and represents the class e preferred stock original issuance cost that was paid in 2004 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 2276 million in 2014 compared to 2036 million in 2013 an increase of 240 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 104 in 2014 as compared to 106 in 2013 a decrease of 002 or 19 net income available to common stockholders was 1145 million in 2012 net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 net income available to common stockholders for 2013 was impacted by an unusually large gain on property sales which represents 018 on a diluted per common share basis additionally net income available to common stockholders for 2013 includes 130 million of mergerrelated costs for the acquisition of arct which represents 007 on a diluted per common share basis and 37 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from tenyear vesting to five years which represents 002 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

gains from the sale of properties during 2014 were 421 million as compared to gains from the sale of properties of 647 million during 2013 and 99 million during 2012 

  

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

  

in 2014 our ffo increased by 1009 million or 218 to 5629 million versus 4620 million in 2013 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 258 in 2014 compared to 241 in 2013 an increase of 017 or 71 in 2012 ffo was 2688 million or 202 on a diluted per common share basis ffo in 2014 includes a noncash redemption charge of 60 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis this charge is for the excess of 

  

  

redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006 ffo in 2013 and 2012 was normalized to exclude 130 million and 79 million of mergerrelated costs which represents 007 and 006 on a diluted per common share basis for 2013 and 2012 respectively ffo for 2013 includes 37 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from tenyear vesting to five years which represents 002 on a diluted per common share basis all references to ffo for 2013 and 2012 reflect the adjustments for mergerrelated costs for the acquisition of arct 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

   

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets reduced by gains on property sales and extraordinary items our ffo for 2013 and 2012 has also been normalized to exclude arct mergerrelated costs 

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility

in 2014 our affo increased by 986 million or 213 to 5617 million versus 4631 million in 2013 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 257 in 2014 compared to 241 in 2013 an increase of 016 or 66 in 2012 affo was 2742 million or 206 on a diluted per common share basis we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term “cad” for cash available for distribution “fad” for funds available for distribution or other terms 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

1   see reconciling items for ffo presented under “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo” 

  

2   includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in march 2003 november 2003 march 2005 september 2005 september 2006 september 2007 june 2010 june 2011 october 2012 july 2013 june 2014 and september 2014 additionally this includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred and capitalized in connection with our assumption of the mortgages payable and the issuance of our term loan the deferred financing costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages and term loan no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

  

3   includes adjustments allocable to both noncontrolling interests and capital lease obligations 

  

4   the computation of diluted affo does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible to common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted affo per share in a given period 

  

  

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

  

presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

  

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings or fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

of our 4327 properties in our portfolio approximately 980 or 4238 are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility term loan mortgages payable and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

  

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

  

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2014 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  

expected maturity data 

  

   

1   excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable and original issuance discounts recorded on notes payable at december 31 2014 the unamortized balance of net premiums on mortgages payable is 166 million and the unamortized balance of original issuance discounts on notes payable is 146 million 

  

2   we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes and bonds at december 31 2014 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at december 31 2014 on the relevant treasury yield curve plus an applicable creditadjusted spread we believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance and term loan balance reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at december 31 2014 

  

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2014 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates all of our mortgages payable except five with an outstanding principal balance of 775 million at december 31 2014 have fixed interest rates all of these variable rate mortgages have arrangements that limit our exposure to interest rate risk interest on our credit facility and term loan balance is variable however the variable interest rate feature on our term loan has been mitigated by an interest rate swap agreement based on our credit facility balance of 2230 million at december 31 2014 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 22 million per year 

  

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal controlintegrated framework 2013” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

 item 1 business 

the company 

  

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  or realty income is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to commercial tenants we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal credit research real estate research portfolio management including property and asset management and capital markets expertise over the past 45 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements 

  

realty income was founded in 1969 and in 1994 was listed on the new york stock exchange or nyse we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and funds from operations or ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 

  

generally our portfolio management efforts seek to achieve 

  

·   contractual rent increases on existing leases 

·   rent increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit and 

·   the active management of our property portfolio including releasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties thereby mitigating our exposure to certain tenants and markets 

  

at december 31 2013 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

·   of 3896 properties 

·   with an occupancy rate of 982 or 3826 properties leased and 70 properties available for lease 

·   leased to 205 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries

of the 3896 properties in the portfolio 3876 or 995 are singletenant properties and the remaining twenty are multitenant properties at december 31 2013 of the 3876 singletenant properties 3807 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 108 years 

  

in acquiring additional properties our strategy is primarily to acquire freestanding singletenant locations under longterm net lease agreements our acquisition and investment activities generally focus on businesses providing goods and services that satisfy basic consumer and business needs in general our net lease agreements 

  

·   are for initial terms of 10 to 20 years 

·   require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses taxes insurance and maintenance and 

·   provide for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level or fixed increases

recent developments 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 45year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2013 

  

   

the dividends paid per share during 2013 as compared to 2012 increased 212 which is the largest annual increase in the company’s history the 2013 dividends paid per share totaled 21474587 as compared to 17716250 in 2012 an increase of 03758337 

  

in december 2013 we declared an increased dividend of 01821667 per share which was paid in january 2014 the increase in january 2014 was our 65 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 74 th increase in the amount of the dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in january 2014 and february 2014 we declared dividends of 01821667 per share which will be paid in february 2014 and march 2014 respectively 

  

the monthly dividend of 01821667 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2186 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 59 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 3733 on december 31 2013 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

  

acquisitions during 2013 

during 2013 we invested 151 billion in 459 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 71 the 459 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states will contain approximately 90 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 140 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 23 industries and the property types consist of 838 retail 92 office 49 industrial and distribution and 21 manufacturing based on rental revenue these investments are in addition to the 32 billion acquisition of 515 properties of american realty capital trust inc or arct which were added to our real estate portfolio during the first quarter of 2013 our combined total investment in real estate assets during 2013 was 467 billion in 974 new properties and properties under development or expansion during 2013 none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2013 

  

in conjunction with our acquisition of arct each outstanding share of arct common stock was converted into the right to receive a combination of i 035 in cash and ii 02874 shares of our common stock resulting in the issuance of a total of approximately 456 million shares of our common stock to arct shareholders valued at a per share amount of 4404 which was the closing sale price of our common stock on january 22 2013 in connection with the closing of this acquisition we terminated and repaid the amounts then outstanding of approximately 5529 million under arct’s revolving credit facility and term loan in connection with our acquisition of arct we assumed approximately 5163 million of mortgages payable we incurred merger costs of 130 million and 79 million respectively in 2013 and 2012 the total merger costs were approximately 21 million 

  

our acquisition of arct provided benefits to realty income including accretion to net earnings growth in the size of our real estate portfolio diversification of industries and property type and increase in the percentage of investment grade tenants 

  

the 515 properties added to our real estate portfolio as a result of the arct acquisition are located in 44 states and puerto rico contain over 160 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 122 years the 69 tenants occupying the 515 properties acquired operate in 28 industries and the property types consist of 540 retail 326 industrial and distribution and 134 office based on rental revenue 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent under the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income which is calculated by multiplying the capitalization rate determined by the lease by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs for the first full year of each lease divided by such projected total investment in the property of the 467 billion we invested during 2013 396 million was invested in 21 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 85 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  

john p case appointed chief executive officer ceo 

in september 2013 we announced that our board of directors appointed john p case as ceo of the company mr case who had previously served as president and chief investment officer succeeded tom a lewis who retired as our ceo mr lewis had been our ceo since 1997 mr case is only the third ceo in realty income’s 45year history 

  

  

portfolio discussion 

  

leasing results 

at december 31 2013 we had 70 properties available for lease out of 3896 properties in our portfolio which represents a 982 occupancy rate since december 31 2012 when we reported 84 properties available for lease and a 972 occupancy rate we 

  

·   leased 27 properties 

·   sold 19 properties available for lease and 

·   have 32 new properties available for lease 

  

during 2013 136 properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants the annual rent on these leases was 161 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 160 million at december 31 2013 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1321 per square foot on the 3807 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2013 we classified 12 properties with a carrying amount of 120 million as held for sale on our balance sheet 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2013 we capitalized costs of 85 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 13 million for releasing costs and 72 million for building and tenant improvements in 2012 we capitalized costs of 66 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 162 million for releasing costs and 493 million for building and tenant improvements 

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

the majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

amendment to credit facility 

in october 2013 we amended our credit facility by increasing the borrowing capacity by 500 million to 15 billion all other material business terms of the credit facility remain unchanged

in march 2013 we issued 17250000 shares of common stock at a price of 4590 per share after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of 367 million the net proceeds of 7551 million were used to redeem our 5375 notes in march 2013 and repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility which were used to fund property acquisitions including our acquisition of arct

term loan 

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing january 21 2018 to partially repay the then outstanding arct term loan borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor plus 120 in conjunction with this term loan we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 215

net income available to common stockholders was 2036 million in 2013 compared to 1145 million in 2012 an increase of 891 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 106 in 2013 as compared to 086 in 2012 an increase of 020 or 233 net income available to common stockholders for 2013 includes 130 million of mergerrelated costs for the acquisition of arct which represents 007 on a diluted per common share basis and 37 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from tenyear vesting to five years which represents 002 on a diluted per common share basis net income available to common stockholders for 2012 includes 79 million of mergerrelated costs for the acquisition of arct which represents 006 on a diluted per common share basis and a 37 million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the shares of our 7375 monthly income class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock or class d preferred stock which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

gains from the sale of properties during 2013 were 647 million as compared to gains from the sale of properties of 99 million during 2012

dividend policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock 675 monthly income class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock or class e preferred stock and 6625 monthly income class f cumulative redeemable preferred stock or class f preferred stock if and when declared by our board of directors 

  

distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of tau operating partnership lp and realty income lp each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders 

  

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2013 our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled 4512 million or approximately 1614 of our estimated taxable income of 2796 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our 2013 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 4092 million representing 884 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 4631 million 

  

the class e preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 675 per annum on the 2500 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 16875 per annum per share the class f preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6625 per annum on the 2500 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 165625 per annum per share dividends on our class e and class f preferred stock are current 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo normalized ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code our debt service requirements and any other factors our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions paid by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year 

  

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 387 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2013 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we estimate that in 2014 between 15 and 30 of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital 

  

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our 15 billion credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2013 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes term loan mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 418 billion or approximately 332 of our total market capitalization of 1259 billion 

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2013 as the sum of 

  

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 207485073 plus total common units of 851568 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 3733 per share on december 31 2013 or 778 billion 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class e preferred stock of 2200 million 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class f preferred stock of 4088 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 1280 million on our credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 7834 million which includes net mortgage premiums of 289 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 700 million on our term loan and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 32 billion which excludes unamortized original issuance discounts of 145 million 

  

investment philosophy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on 1 increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 2 additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level or 3 fixed increases we believe that a portfolio of properties owned under longterm net leases generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

investment strategy 

when identifying new properties for acquisition we generally focus on providing capital to owners and operators of commercial tenants by acquiring the real estate they consider important to the successful operation of their business 

  

  

we primarily focus on acquiring properties with many of the following attributes 

  

·   tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow 

·   tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources 

·   tenants that are willing to sign a longterm lease 10 or more years 

·   tenants that are large owners and users of real estate 

·   real estate that is critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue ie they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business 

·   real estate with property valuations at or below replacement cost 

·   properties with rental or lease payments that are at or below market rents and 

·   property transactions where we can achieve an attractive spread over our cost of capital 

  

from a retail perspective our investment focus has primarily been on businesses that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2013 approximately 591 of our retail rental revenue was derived from tenants with a service component in their business we believe these serviceoriented businesses would generally be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internetbased businesses 

  

diversification is also a key objective of our investment strategy we believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant industry property type and geographic location leads to more predictable investment results for our shareholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration our investment efforts have led to a diversified property portfolio that as of december 31 2013 consisted of 3896 properties located in 49 states and puerto rico leased to 205 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 industry segments each of the 47 industry segments represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for no more than 106 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2013 

  

credit strategy 

we typically acquire and lease properties to tenants in transactions where we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return since 1970 our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 

  

we believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligations is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

  

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a fourpart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

  

·   industry company market conditions and credit profile 

·   store profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available 

·   the importance of the real estate location to the operations of the company’s business and 

·   overall real estate characteristics including property value and comparative rental rates 

  

prior to entering into any transaction our investment professionals assisted by our research department conduct a review of a tenant’s credit quality the information reviewed may include reports and filings including any public credit ratings financial statements debt and equity analyst reports and reviews of corporate credit spreads stock prices market capitalization and other financial metrics we conduct additional due diligence including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates we continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed and providing summaries of these findings to management 

  

  

acquisition strategy 

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national commercial tenants are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale strong consumer brands advertising and the selection of prime locations our acquisition strategy is to act as a source of capital to regional and national commercial tenants by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of properties net leased to multiple tenants in a variety of industries we have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities often using our proprietary relationships with various tenants ownersdevelopers and advisors to uncover and secure transactions we also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment this research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting potential investments we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

  

·   properties that are freestanding commerciallyzoned with a single tenant 

·   properties that are important locations for regional and national commercial tenants 

·   properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants andor can generally be characterized as important to the operations of the company’s business 

·   properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our tenants with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares and 

·   properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm net lease agreements offering both current income and the potential for rent increases 

  

portfolio management strategy 

the active management of the property portfolio is also an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing our credit quality 

  

we regularly review and analyze 

  

·   the performance of the various industries of our tenants and 

·   the operation management business planning and financial condition of our tenants 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

·   generate higher returns 

·   enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

·   extend our average remaining lease term or 

·   decrease tenant or industry concentration 

  

at december 31 2013 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 120 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2014 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately 50 million in property sales for all of 2014 we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

  

universal shelf registration 

in february 2013 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in february 2016 this replaces our prior shelf registration statement in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

  

15 billion acquisition credit facility 

in october 2013 we increased our unsecured acquisition credit facility from 10 billion to 15 billion the initial term of the credit facility expires in may 2016 and includes at our election a oneyear extension option under this credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling we also have other interest rate options available to us under this credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2013 we had a borrowing capacity of 1372 billion available on our credit facility subject to customary conditions to borrowing and an outstanding balance of 1280 million the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2013 was 12 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2013 we remain in compliance with these covenants 

  

we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter when capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 103 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a “stable” outlook and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

  

based on our current ratings the credit facility interest rate is libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 basis points over libor the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 185 if our credit facility is lower than bbbbaa3 and ii libor plus 100 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 045 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 and ii 015 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

notes outstanding 

as of december 31 2013 we had 32 billion of senior unsecured note and bond obligations excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 145 million all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually

term loan 

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in january 2018 borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor plus 120 in conjunction with this term loan we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 215

·   lack of demand in areas where our properties are located 

·   inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants 

·   oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates 

·   declines in our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent which may be affected by their operations the current economic situation and competition within their industries from other operators 

·   defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations 

·   economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located and 

·   deterioration of the physical condition of our properties 

  

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us 

  

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against the tenant for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as a result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect cash from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness 

  

  

seventy of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2013 all but one of which were singletenant properties at december 31 2013 twentynine of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2013 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

for the fourth quarter of 2013 our tenants in the “convenience stores” industry accounted for approximately 106 of our rental revenue a downturn in this industry whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect tenants in this industry which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock 

  

individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2013 nevertheless downturns in these other industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common and preferred stock in addition we may in the future make additional investments in the “convenience store” industry which would increase this industry’s percentage of our rental revenues thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in this industry would have on us 

  

in addition a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket commercial tenants that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket commercial tenants and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional national or international economy 

  

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant net lease retail locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states and properties leased to tenants engaged in nonretail businesses for example our acquisition of arct included tenants in the aerospace freight governmental services healthcare home maintenance manufacturing pharmacy retail banking technology and telecommunications businesses some of which are nonretail businesses and none of which was in an industry segment that was within our property portfolio prior to our acquisition of arct these risks may include a limited knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the tenant operates limited experience in managing certain types of new properties new types of real estate locations and lease structures and the laws and culture of any nonus jurisdiction 

  

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

·   our knowledge of the contamination 

·   the timing of the contamination 

·   the cause of the contamination or 

·   the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the 

  

  

property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings with asbestos in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

it is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result should our tenants or their employees or customers be exposed to mold at any of our properties we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property which would reduce our cash available for distribution in addition exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise 

  

compliance   we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

  

insurance and indemnity   in july 2012 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in july 2022 and replaced our previous sevenyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 60 million in the aggregate the limits on the excess policy are 5 million per occurrence and 10 million in the aggregate therefore the primary and excess tenyear policies together provide a total limit of 15 million per occurrence and 70 million in the aggregate 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

  

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

  

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

·   we would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

·   we would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income 

·   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

·   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

·   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property 

  

distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

  

we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that under certain circumstances may be exchanged for shares of our common stock this acquisition structure may have the effect of among other things reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of or refinance the debt on the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain similarly we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 15 billion acquisition credit facility at december 31 2013 we had 128 million of outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility a total of 32 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 145 million 70 million of borrowings outstanding under a senior unsecured term loan and approximately 7545 million of outstanding mortgage debt excluding net premiums totaling 289 million on these mortgages to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our acquisition credit facility our term loan and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our acquisition credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

  

in addition our acquisition credit facility term loan facility and mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our acquisition credit facility provides that if an event of default as defined in the credit facility exists neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make any dividends or other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

  

·   the sum of a 95 of our adjusted funds from operations as defined by the credit facility agreement for that period plus b the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period and 

·   the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our shareholders in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

  

except that we may repurchase or redeem preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock the acquisition credit facility further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to any of our subsidiaries that have guaranteed amounts payable under the credit facility or that meet a significance test set forth in the credit facility we and our subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or other distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under our acquisition credit facility were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or prevent us from paying those dividends or other distributions altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit likewise one of our subsidiaries is the borrower under our 70 million term loan facility and that facility requires that this subsidiary maintain its consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the 

  

  

term loan facility above a certain minimum dollar amount and comply with certain other financial covenants this minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant may limit the ability of this subsidiary as well as other subsidiaries that are owned by this subsidiary to provide funds to us in order to pay dividend and other distributions on our common stock including the shares of common stock offered hereby and preferred stock and amounts due on our indebtedness any failure by this subsidiary to comply with these financial covenants will and any failure by this subsidiary to comply with other covenants in the term loan facility may result in an event of default under that facility which could have adverse consequences similar to those that may result from an event of default under our acquisition credit facility as described above 

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock and preferred stock and debt securities including 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 

·   requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 

·   limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

·   putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

  

if we default under a loan agreement or other debt instrument the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal of and interest on all of their loans and in the case of secured indebtedness to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral moreover a default under a single loan or debt instrument may trigger crossdefault or cross acceleration provisions in other indebtedness and debt instruments giving the holders of such other indebtedness and debt instruments similar rights to demand immediate repayment and seize and sell any collateral 

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time including 

  

·   prevailing interest rates increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities 

·   the market for similar securities issued by other reits 

·   general economic and financial market conditions 

·   the financial condition performance and prospects of us our tenants and our competitors 

·   changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us our competitors or our industry 

·   changes in our credit ratings and 

·   actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors 

  

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the us trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

·   adverse changes in general or local economic conditions 

·   changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties 

·   changes in interest rates and operating expenses 

·   competition for tenants 

·   changes in market rental rates 

·   inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases 

·   renewal of leases at lower rental rates 

·   inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship including bankruptcy 

·   changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate 

·   uninsured property liability 

·   property damage or casualty losses 

·   unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws 

·   the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties 

·   physical or weatherrelated damage to properties 

·   the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time 

·   acts of terrorism and war and 

·   acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

  

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between 1000000 and 10000000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

  

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry 

  

terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or us businesses these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants 

  

if events like these were to occur they could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last several years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably in addition the ongoing global financial crisis which includes concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar effect these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing unrest in certain middle eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at 

  

  

reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

  

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent 

  

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the sec is currently considering whether issuers in the us should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards or ifrs instead of us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap ifrs is a comprehensive set of accounting standards promulgated by the international accounting standards board or iasb which are rapidly gaining worldwide acceptance additionally the financial accounting standards board or fasb is considering various changes to gaap some of which may be significant as part of a joint effort with the iasb to converge accounting standards although the fasb and iasb currently have a project on their agenda to examine the accounting for leases the project may not result in the issuance of a final standard or a standard that would be comparable to current gaap if ifrs is adopted the potential issues associated with lease accounting along with other potential changes associated with the adoption or convergence with ifrs may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and funds from operations or ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties

liquidity and capital resources 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our 15 billion credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings 

  

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2013 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds term loan mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 418 billion or approximately 332 of our total market capitalization of 1259 billion 

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2013 as the sum of 

  

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 207485073 plus total common units of 851568 multiplied by the closing sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 3733 per share on december 31 2013 or 778 billion 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class e preferred stock of 2200 million 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class f preferred stock of 4088 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 1280 million on our credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 7834 million which includes net mortgage premiums of 289 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 700 million on our term loan and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 32 billion excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 145 million 

  

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2013 we had 7545 million of mortgages payable all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions included in this amount is 5144 million of mortgages payable assumed in connection with the arct acquisition additionally at december 31 2013 we had net premiums totaling 289 million on these mortgages of which 162 million is in connection with the arct acquisition 

  

we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that will make it economically feasible to do so we intend to continue to primarily identify property acquisitions that are free from mortgage indebtedness during 2013 we made 414 million of principal payments which includes 117 million to pay off one mortgage in august 2013 and 231 million to pay off three mortgages in december 2013 

  

term loan 

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in january 2018 borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor plus 120 in conjunction with this term loan we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 215 

  

15 billion acquisition credit facility 

in october 2013 we increased our unsecured acquisition credit facility from 10 billion to 15 billion the initial term of the credit facility expires in may 2016 and includes at our election a oneyear extension option under this credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling we also have other interest rate options available to us under this credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

at december 31 2013 we had a borrowing capacity of 1372 billion available on our credit facility subject to customary conditions to borrowing and an outstanding balance of 1280 million the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2013 was 12 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2013 we remain in compliance with these covenants we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

on february 12 2014 we had an outstanding balance on our credit facility of 5830 million 

  

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter when capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

notes outstanding 

as of december 31 2013 we had 32 billion of senior unsecured note and bond obligations excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 145 million all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 

  

in july 2013 we issued 750 million of 465 senior unsecured notes due august 2023 or the 2023 notes the price to the investors for the 2023 notes was 99775 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 4678 per annum the total net proceeds of approximately 7414 million from this offering was used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and the remaining proceeds were used for other general corporate purposes and working capital including additional property acquisitions 

  

in march 2013 we repaid the 100 million of outstanding 5375 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest using proceeds from our march 2013 common stock offering and our credit facility 

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 103 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use permanent or longterm capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

acquisitions during 2013 

during 2013 realty income invested 151 billion in 459 new properties and properties under development or expansion in addition to our acquisition of arct which is discussed in more detail below with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 71 the 459 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states will contain approximately 90 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 140 years the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 23 industries and the property types consist of 838 retail 92 office 49 industrial and distribution and 21 manufacturing based on rental revenue these investments are in addition to the 32 billion acquisition of 515 properties of american realty capital trust inc or arct which were added to our real estate portfolio during the first quarter of 2013 our combined total investment in real estate assets during 2013 was 467 billion in 974 new properties and properties under development or expansion during 2013 none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2013 

  

additionally in september 2013 we purchased a property for 454 million in san diego california which will serve as our new corporate headquarters we plan on relocating to this facility during the second half of 2014 

  

in conjunction with our acquisition of arct each outstanding share of arct common stock was converted into the right to receive a combination of i 035 in cash and ii 02874 shares of our common stock resulting in the issuance of a total of approximately 456 million shares of our common stock to arct shareholders valued at a per share amount of 4404 which was the closing sale price of our common stock on january 22 2013 in connection with the closing of this acquisition we terminated and repaid the amounts then outstanding of approximately 5529 million under arct’s revolving credit facility and term loan in connection with our acquisition of arct we assumed approximately 5163 million of mortgages payable we incurred merger costs of 130 million and 79 million respectively in 2013 and 2012 the total merger costs were approximately 21 million 

  

  

the acquisition of arct provided benefits to realty income including accretion to net earnings growth in the size of our real estate portfolio diversification of industries and property type and increase in the percentage of investment grade tenants 

  

the 515 properties added to our real estate portfolio as a result of the arct acquisition are located in 44 states and puerto rico contain over 160 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with a weighted average lease term of 122 years the 69 tenants occupying the 515 properties acquired operate in 28 industries and the property types consist of 540 retail 326 industrial and distribution and 134 office based on rental revenue 

  

the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the aggregate base rent under the lease for the first full year of each lease divided by the total cost of the property since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

in the case of a property under development or expansion the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows estimated net operating income which is calculated by multiplying the capitalization rate determined by the lease by our projected total investment in the property including land construction and capitalized interest costs for the first full year of each lease divided by such projected total investment in the property of the 467 billion we invested during 2013 excluding the new corporate headquarters 396 million was invested in 21 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 85 we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  

john p case appointed chief executive officer ceo 

in september 2013 we announced that our board of directors appointed john p case as ceo of the company mr case who had previously served as president and chief investment officer succeeded tom a lewis who retired as our ceo mr lewis had been our ceo since 1997 mr case is only the third ceo in realty income’s 45year history 

  

portfolio discussion 

  

leasing results 

at december 31 2013 we had 70 properties available for lease out of 3896 properties in our portfolio which represents a 982 occupancy rate since december 31 2012 when we reported 84 properties available for lease and a 972 occupancy rate we 

  

·   leased 27 properties 

·   sold 19 properties available for lease and 

·   have 32 new properties available for lease 

  

during 2013 136 properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants the annual rent on these leases was 161 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 160 million at december 31 2013 our average annualized rental revenue per square foot was approximately 1321 per square foot on the 3807 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2013 we classified 12 properties with a carrying amount of 120 million as held for sale on our balance sheet 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2013 we capitalized costs of 85 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 13 million for releasing costs and 72 million for building and tenant improvements in 2012 we capitalized costs of 66 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 162 million for releasing costs and 493 million for building improvements 

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

  

the majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market credit worthiness and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly see our discussion of “risk factors” in this annual report 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 45year policy of paying monthly dividends in addition we increased the dividend five times during 2013

in december 2013 we declared an increased dividend of 01821667 per share which was paid in january 2014 the increase in january 2014 was our 65 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 74 th increase in the amount of the dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in january 2014 and february 2014 we declared dividends of 01821667 per share which will be paid in february 2014 and march 2014 respectively 

  

the monthly dividend of 01821667 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2186 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 59 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 3733 on december 31 2013 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a “stable” outlook and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook 

  

based on our current ratings the credit facility interest rate is libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 185 if our credit facility is lower than bbbbaa3 and ii libor plus 100 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 045 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 and ii 015 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions in addition if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2013 sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 

  

   

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually all of these notes and bonds contain various covenants at december 31 2013 we remain in compliance with these covenants 

  

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes these calculations which are not based on us gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our notes only and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2013 are 

  

   

1 this covenant is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding fourquarter period on the assumption that i the incurrence of any debt as defined in the covenants incurred by us since the first day of such fourquarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom including to refinance other debt since the first day of such fourquarter period ii the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such fourquarter period and iii any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such fourquarters had in each case occurred on january 1 2013 and subject to certain additional adjustments such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses i ii and iii of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1 2013 nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period the following is our calculation of debt service coverage at december 31 2013 in thousands for trailing twelve months 

  

   

fixed charge coverage ratio 

fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as the debt service coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator similar to debt service coverage ratio we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculations of both debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios may be different from the calculations used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited the presentation of debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios should not be considered as alternatives to any us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap operating performance measures below is our calculation of fixed charges at december 31 2013 in thousands for trailing twelve months 

  

   

  

table of obligations 

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2013 dollars in millions

3 excludes noncash net premiums recorded on the mortgages payable the unamortized balance of these net premiums at december 31 2013 is 289 million

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straightline method over an estimated useful life of 25 to 35 years for buildings and 4 to 15 years for improvements if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 to 35 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 

  

management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when acquiring a property for investment purposes we typically allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value of inplace leases the value of inplace leases and tenant relationships as applicable in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located in addition any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors such as industry type tenant investment grade maturity date and comparable borrowings for similar assets the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

  

rental revenue 

rental revenue was 7476 million for 2013 versus 4665 million for 2012 an increase of 2811 million or 603 rental revenue was 4010 million in 2011 the increase in rental revenue in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily attributable to 

  

·   the 958 properties 250 million square feet acquired by realty income in 2013 which generated 2131 million of rent in 2013 

·   the 423 properties 105 million square feet acquired by realty income in 2012 which generated 811 million of rent in 2013 compared to 227 million in 2012 an increase of 584 million 

·   same store rents generated on 2338 properties 253 million square feet during the entire years of 2013 and 2012 increased by 62 million or 14 to 4352 million from 4290 million 

·   a net increase of 18 million relating to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 132 properties comprising 11 million square feet that were available for lease during part of 2013 or 2012 ii rental revenue for six properties under development iii rental revenue for 29 properties released primarily with rentfree periods and iv lease termination settlements which in aggregate totaled 1256 million in 2013 compared to 1074 million in 2012 and 

·   a net increase in straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to rent of 17 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 

  

for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were available for lease at any time ii were under development iii we have made an additional investment in iv were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced and v were released with rentfree periods each of the exclusions from the same store pool is separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

  

of the 3896 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2013 3876 or 995 are singletenant properties and the remaining twenty are multitenant properties of the 3876 singletenant properties 3807 or 982 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 108 years at december 31 2013 of our 3807 leased singletenant properties 3419 or 898 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

·   primarily base rent increases tied to a consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 

·   percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales 

·   fixed increases or 

·   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 28 million in 2013 19 million in 2012 and 13 million in 2011 excluding percentage rent reclassified to discontinued operations of 115000 in 2013 163000 in 2012 and 70000 in 2011 percentage rent in 2013 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2014 

  

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to regional and national commercial tenants under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2013 our portfolio of 3896 properties was 982 leased with 70 properties available for lease as compared to 972 portfolio occupancy or 84 properties available for lease at december 31 2012 it has been our experience that approximately 2 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 

  

tenant reimbursements 

contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses were 249 million in 2013 compared to 146 million in 2012 and 98 million in 2011 the increase in tenant reimbursements from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions including our acquisition of arct our tenant reimbursements match our reimbursable property expenses for any given period 

  

  

other revenue 

other revenue which comprises propertyrelated revenue not included in rental revenue or tenant reimbursements was 59 million in 2013 compared to 17 million in 2012 and 16 million in 2011 

  

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 3066 million in 2013 compared to 1473 million in 2012 and 1165 million in 2011 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2013 and 2012 including the 515 properties acquired as part of our acquisition of arct which was partially offset by property sales in those same years as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders normalized ffo” and “adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo normalized ffo and affo 

  

interest expense 

interest expense was 1809 million in 2013 compared to 1225 million in 2012 and 1083 million in 2011 the increase in interest expense from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in borrowings attributable to the issuance in october 2012 of our 200 senior unsecured notes due january 2018 the issuance in october 2012 of our 325 senior unsecured notes due october 2022 the january 2013 issuance of our 70 million senior unsecured term loan the july 2013 issuance of our 465 senior unsecured notes due august 2023 and an increase in mortgages payable and higher credit facility borrowings which were partially offset by lower average interest rates and the repayment of our 5375 senior unsecured notes in march 2013 

  

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

at december 31 2013 the weighted average interest rate on our 

  

·   notes and bonds payable of 32 billion excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of 145 million was 49 

·   mortgages payable of 7545 million excluding net premiums totaling 289 million on these mortgages was 54 

·   credit facility outstanding borrowings of 1280 million was 12 

·   term loan outstanding borrowings of 700 million was 14 and 

·   combined outstanding notes bonds mortgages and credit facility borrowings of 42 billion was 45 

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased by 188 million to 568 million in 2013 as compared to 380 million in 2012 general and administrative expenses were 310 million in 2011 included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs excluding arct mergerrelated costs of 21 million for 2013 24 million for 2012 and 15 million for 2011 even though general and administrative expenses increased during 2013 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased the increase in expense was primarily due to increases in employee costs including the accelerated vesting of restricted shares in july 2013 which resulted in additional compensation expense of 37 million and higher 

  

  

costs as a result of our integration of arct in january 2014 we had 116 employees as compared to 97 employees in january 2013 and 83 employees in january 2012 

  

   

1 excludes all tenant reimbursements revenue as well as gain on sales and crest net revenue included in discontinued operations 

  

property expenses including reimbursable 

property expenses consist of costs associated with unleased properties nonnet leased properties and general portfolio expenses as well as contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses expenses related to unleased properties and nonnet leased properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2013 70 properties were available for lease as compared to 84 at december 31 2012 and 87 at december 31 2011 

  

property expenses were 388 million including 249 million reimbursable in 2013 213 million including 146 million reimbursable in 2012 and 155 million including 98 million reimbursable in 2011 the increase in property expenses in 2013 is primarily attributable to increased portfolio size higher maintenance and utilities insurance costs property taxes and ground rent expenses as a result of our acquisition of arct along with higher contractually obligated reimbursements primarily due to our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions 

  

income taxes 

income taxes were 27 million in 2013 as compared to 14 million in 2012 and 15 million in 2011 these amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income and its subsidiaries 

  

mergerrelated costs 

mergerrelated costs include but are not limited to advisor fees legal fees accounting fees printing fees and transfer taxes related to our acquisition of arct mergerrelated costs were 130 million in 2013 and 79 million in 2012 on a diluted per common share basis these expenses represented 007 for 2013 and 006 for 2012 

  

discontinued operations 

operations from ten realty income investment properties two crest properties classified as held for sale at december 31 2013 and properties previously sold have been classified as discontinued operations the following is a summary of income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands 

  

   

  

crest’s assets and property sales 

at december 31 2013 crest had an inventory of three properties one of which was classified as held for investment in addition to the three properties crest also held notes receivable of 187 million at december 31 2013 and 189 million at december 31 2012 

  

during 2013 crest did not acquire any properties however crest sold one property in 2013 for 597000 and recorded an impairment of 308000 upon the sale of this property during 2012 crest acquired one property for 890000 but did not sell any properties during 2011 crest did not buy or sell any properties 

  

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

during 2013 we sold 75 investment properties for 1342 million which resulted in a gain of 647 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations 

  

during 2012 we sold 44 investment properties for 506 million which resulted in a gain of 99 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations 

  

during 2011 we sold 26 investment properties for 220 million which resulted in a gain of 52 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations additionally we sold excess real estate from five properties for 21 million which resulted in a gain of 540000 this gain is included in other revenue on our consolidated statement of income for 2011 because this excess real estate was associated with properties that continue to be owned as part of our core operations 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

·   generate higher returns 

·   enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

·   extend our average remaining lease term or 

·   decrease tenant or industry concentration 

  

at december 31 2013 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 120 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2014 we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately 50 million in property sales for all of 2014 we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest 

during 2013 crest recorded a provision for impairment of 308000 for one property sold during the year 

  

during 2012 and 2011 crest did not record any provisions for impairment 

  

provisions for impairment on realty income investment properties 

in 2013 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 30 million provisions for impairment of 27 million are included in income from discontinued operations on seven sold properties and one property classified as held for sale additionally during 2013 realty income recorded provisions for impairment of 290000 on one property held for investment in the automotive service industry this provision for impairment is included in income from continuing operations 

  

in 2012 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 51 million provisions for impairment of 15 million are included in income from discontinued operations on six properties additionally during 2012 realty income recorded provisions for impairment of 36 million on four properties held for investment at december 31 2012 these provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations 

  

  

during 2011 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 405000 on four properties these provisions for impairment are included in income from discontinued operations except for 10000 which is included in income from continuing operations 

  

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock dividends totaled 419 million in 2013 409 million in 2012 and 243 million in 2011 

  

excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

when we redeemed our class d preferred stock in march 2012 we incurred a charge of 37 million for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value this charge representing the class d preferred stock original issuance cost that was paid in 2004 was recorded as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders when the shares were redeemed during the first quarter of 2012 on a diluted per common share basis this charge was 003 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 2036 million in 2013 an increase of 891 million as compared to 1145 million in 2012 net income available to common stockholders in 2011 was 1328 million net income available to common stockholders in 2013 includes 130 million of mergerrelated costs for the acquisition of arct which represents 007 on a diluted per common share basis and 37 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from tenyear vesting to five years which represents 002 on a diluted per common share basis net income available to common stockholders in 2012 includes 79 million of mergerrelated costs related to the acquisition of arct which represents 006 on a diluted per common share basis and a 37 million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the class d preferred shares which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

gains from the sale of investment properties during 2013 were 647 million as compared to gains from the sale of investment properties of 99 million during 2012 and a 57 million gain from the sale of properties during 2011 

  

funds from operatio ns available to common stockholders ffo and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders normalized ffo 

  

ffo for 2013 increased by 1881 million or 721 to 4490 million as compared to 2609 million in 2012 and 2494 million in 2011 ffo for 2013 includes 130 million for mergerrelated costs related to our acquisition of arct which represents 007 on a diluted per common share basis and 37 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from tenyear vesting to five years which represents 002 on a diluted per common share basis ffo for 2012 includes 79 million of mergerrelated costs which represents 006 on a diluted per common share basis and a 37 million charge associated with the class d preferred stock redemption in march 2012 which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding the mergerrelated costs for our 2013 acquisition of arct normalized ffo for 2013 increased by 1932 million or 719 to 4620 million as compared to 2688 million in 2012 and 2494 million in 2011 

  

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and normalized ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets reduced by gains on the sale of investment properties and extraordinary items we define normalized ffo a nongaap measure as ffo excluding the mergerrelated costs for our 2013 acquisition of arct 

  

we consider ffo and normalized ffo to be appropriate supplemental measures of a reit’s operating performance as they are based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo and adds back mergerrelated costs for normalized ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

  

  

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

  

affo for 2013 increased by 1889 million or 689 to 4631 million as compared to 2742 million in 2012 and 2534 million in 2011 we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term “cad” for cash available for distribution “fad” for funds available for distribution or other terms 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo normalized ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

1   see reconciling items for ffo presented under “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders normalized ffo” 

  

2   includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in march 2003 november 2003 march 2005 september 2005 september 2006 september 2007 june 2010 june 2011 october 2012 and july 2013 additionally this includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred and capitalized in connection with our assumption of the mortgages payable and the issuance of our term loan the deferred financing costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages and term loan no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

  

  

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure by which to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to the measurement of the particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

  

presentation of the information regarding ffo normalized ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo normalized ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo normalized ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo normalized ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo normalized ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

  

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

of our 3896 properties in our portfolio approximately 977 or 3807 are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

as of december 31 2013 the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business is not considered to be material 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility term loan and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

  

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2013 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  

  

expected maturity data 

  

   

1   excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable and original issuance discounts recorded on notes payable at december 31 2013 the unamortized balance of net premiums on mortgages payable is 289 million and the unamortized balance of original issuance discounts on notes payable is 145 million 

  

2   we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes at december 31 2013 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our notes payable we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at december 31 2013 on the relevant treasury yield curve plus an applicable creditadjusted spread we believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance and term loan balance reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at december 31 2013 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2013 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates all of our mortgages payable have fixed interest rates except three with a total value of 633 million excluding net premiums at december 31 2013 interest on our credit facility and term loan balance is variable however the variable interest rate feature on our term loan has been mitigated by an interest rate swap agreement based on our credit facility balance of 1280 million at december 31 2013 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 13 million per year 

  




 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  

  




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2013 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control—integrated framework 1992” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting

paul m meurer chief financial officer executive vice president and treasurer 

  

  

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

 item 1 business 

the company 

  

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  or realty income is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations our monthly distributions or dividends are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to commercial enterprises we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal credit research real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 44 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements 

  

in 1994 realty income was listed on the new york stock exchange or nyse and we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and funds from operations or ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 

  

generally our portfolio management efforts seek to achieve 

  

·   contractual rent increases on existing leases 

·   rent increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit and 

·   the active management of our property portfolio including releasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties thereby mitigating our exposure to certain tenants and markets 

  

in acquiring additional properties our strategy is primarily to acquire properties that are 

  

·   freestanding singletenant locations 

·   leased to regional and national commercial enterprises and 

·   leased under longterm netlease agreements 

  

at december 31 2012 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

·   of 3013 properties 

·   with an occupancy rate of 972 or 2929 properties leased and only 84 properties available for lease 

·   leased to 150 different commercial enterprises doing business in 44 separate industries 

·   located in 49 states 

·   with over 376 million square feet of leasable space and 

·   with an average leasable space per property of approximately 12500 square feet 

  

of the 3013 properties in the portfolio 2996 or 994 are singletenant properties and the remaining 17 are multitenant properties at december 31 2012 of the 2996 singletenant properties 2913 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 110 years 

  

we typically acquire properties under longterm leases with regional and national retailers and other commercial enterprises our acquisition and investment activities generally focus on businesses providing goods and services that satisfy basic consumer and business needs in general our netlease agreements 

  

·   are for initial terms of 10 to 20 years

recent developments 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we have continued our 44year policy of paying monthly dividends monthly dividends per common share increased by 00003125 in april 2012 to 01458125 increased by 00003125 in july 2012 to 0146125 increased by 0005 in september 2012 to 0151125 increased by 00003125 in october 2012 to 01514375 increased by 00003125 in january 2013 to 015175 and increased by 00291667 in february 2013 to 01809167 the increase in january 2013 was our 61 st consecutive quarterly increase and the increase in february 2013 was our 70 th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2012 we paid three monthly cash dividends per common share in the amount of 01455 three in the amount of 01458125 two in the amount of 0146125 one in the amount of 0151125 and three in the amount of 01514375 totaling 1771625 in december 2012 we declared dividends of 015175 per share which were paid in january 2013 in january 2013 and february 2013 we declared dividends of 01809167 per share which will be paid in february 2013 and march 2013 respectively 

  

the monthly dividend of 01809167 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2171 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 50 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 4340 on february 1 2013 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period 

  

acquisitions during 2012 

during 2012 realty income invested 116 billion in real estate acquiring 423 properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 72 the majority of the lease revenue from these properties is generated from investment grade tenants these 423 properties and properties under development are located in 37 states will contain over 105 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 146 years the tenants of the 423 properties acquired operate in 23 industries aerospace apparel stores automotive collision services automotive parts consumer appliances consumer goods convenience stores crafts and novelties diversified industrial dollar stores drug stores equipment services food processing health and fitness insurance machinery motor vehicle dealerships packaging 

  

  

paper restaurants – quick service theaters transportation services and wholesale clubs none of the investments in these properties caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2012 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent or in the case of a property under development the estimated base rent for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total cost of the properties since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

january 2013 acquisition of american realty capital trust inc 

on january 22 2013 we completed our acquisition of american realty capital trust inc or arct in a transaction valued at approximately 31 billion pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement and plan of merger dated as of september 6 2012 as amended on january 6 2013 at the effective time of the acquisition each outstanding share of arct common stock was converted into the right to receive a combination of i 035 in cash and ii 02874 shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition at the closing we terminated and repaid the amounts then outstanding of approximately 5529 million under arct’s revolving credit facility and term loan in conjunction with our acquisition of arct in january 2013 we assumed approximately 5163 million of mortgages payable with this acquisition we added 515 properties to our portfolio through 2012 we have incurred 79 million of merger costs we anticipate that the total merger costs will be approximately 19 million 

  

in january 2013 in connection with our acquisition of arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing january 21 2018 borrowing under the term loan bears interest at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 120 in conjunction with this term loan we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 215 

  

portfolio discussion 

  

leasing results 

at december 31 2012 we had 84 properties available for lease out of 3013 properties in our portfolio which represents a 972 occupancy rate since december 31 2011 when we reported 87 properties available for lease and a 967 occupancy rate we 

  

·   leased 47 properties 

·   sold 20 properties available for lease and 

·   have 64 new properties available for lease 

  

during 2012 124 properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants the rent on these leases was 106 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 109 million at december 31 2012 our average annualized rental revenue was approximately 1456 per square foot on the 2929 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2012 we classified 14 properties with a carrying amount of 192 million as held for sale on our balance sheet 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2012 we capitalized costs of 66 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 162 million for releasing costs and 493 million for building and tenant improvements in 2011 we capitalized costs of 42 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 17 million for releasing costs and 25 million for building and tenant improvements 

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

the majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market tenant credit worthiness and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

  

note issuance 

in october 2012 we issued 350 million in aggregate principal amount of 200 senior unsecured notes due january 2018 or the 2018 notes and 450 million in aggregate principal amount of 325 senior unsecured notes due october 2022 or the 2022 notes the price to the investors for the 2018 notes was 99910 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 2017 per annum the price to the investors for the 2022 notes was 99382 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 3323 per annum the total net proceeds of 7901 million from these offerings were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including additional property acquisitions

authorized shares 

in june 2012 our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock to 370100000 and the number of authorized shares of our preferred stock to 69900000 

  

1 billion acquisition credit facility 

in may 2012 we entered into a new 1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility which replaced our 425 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in march 2014 the initial term of the new credit facility expires in may 2016 and includes at our option a oneyear extension under this new credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling we also have other interest rate options available to us our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation 

  

2012 incentive award plan 

in march 2012 our board of directors adopted and in may 2012 our stockholders approved the realty income corporation 2012 incentive award plan or the 2012 plan to enable us to attract and retain the services of directors employees and consultants considered essential to our longterm success the 2012 plan offers our directors employees and consultants an opportunity to own stock in realty income or rights that will reflect our growth development and financial success the 2012 plan replaced the 2003 incentive award plan of realty income corporation as amended and restated february 21 2006 which was set to expire in march 2013 

  

issuance and redemption of preferred stock 

in february 2012 we issued 1495 million shares of 6625 monthly income class f cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a price of 2500 per share including 195 million shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their overallotment option in april 2012 we issued an additional 14 million shares of our class f preferred stock at a price of 252863 per share of the aggregate net proceeds of approximately 3954 million from these issuances 1275 million was used to redeem all of our outstanding 7375 class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock and the balance was used to repay borrowings under our credit facility the dividend rate difference of 075 between the class d and class f preferred stock provides us 

  

  

savings of 956000 annually on the class d redemption amount of 1275 million beginning february 15 2017 the class f preferred shares are redeemable at our option for 2500 per share the initial dividend of 01702257 per share was paid on march 15 2012 and covered 37 days thereafter dividends of 0138021 per share will be paid monthly in arrears 

  

we redeemed all of the 51 million shares of our 7375 monthly income class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock in march 2012 for 2500 per share plus accrued dividends we incurred a charge of 37 million representing the class d preferred stock original issuance costs that we paid in 2004 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1145 million in 2012 compared to 1328 million in 2011 a decrease of 183 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 086 in 2012 as compared to 105 in 2011 net income available to common stockholders for 2012 includes 79 million of mergerrelated costs which represents 006 on a diluted per common share basis for the acquisition of arct additionally net income available to common stockholders in 2012 includes a 37 million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the shares of our class d preferred stock which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties and excess real estate the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

gains from the sale of properties during 2012 were 99 million as compared to gains from the sale of properties and excess real estate of 57 million during 2011 

  

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders normalized ffo 

in 2012 our ffo increased by 115 million or 46 to 2609 million versus 2494 million in 2011 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 196 in 2012 compared to 198 in 2011 a decrease of 002 or 10 ffo in 2012 includes 79 million of mergerrelated costs which represents 006 on a diluted per common share basis and includes a 37 million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the shares of our class d preferred stock which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding the mergerrelated costs for our acquisition of arct in 2012 our normalized ffo increased by 194 million or 78 to 2688 million versus 2494 million in 2011 on a diluted common share basis normalized ffo was 202 in 2012 compared to 198 in 2011 an increase of 004 or 20 

  

see our discussion of ffo and normalized ffo which are not financial measures under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and normalized ffo 

  

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

in 2012 our affo increased by 208 million or 82 to 2742 million versus 2534 million in 2011 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 206 in 2012 compared to 201 in 2011 an increase of 005 or 25

dividend policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to our common class e preferred and class f preferred stockholders if and when declared by our board of directors 

  

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2012 our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled 2758 million or approximately 1314 of our estimated taxable income of 2099 million our estimated taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our 2012 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 2363 million representing 862 of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of 2742 million 

  

the class e preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 675 per annum on the 2500 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 16875 per annum per share the class f preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6625 per annum on the 2500 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 165625 per annum per share dividends on our class e and class f preferred stock are current 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo normalized ffo affo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual dividend requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended our debt service requirements and any other factors our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions paid by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20 15 for 2012 dividends in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest net lease inc or crest or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year 

  

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock but not below zero distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 245 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2012 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we estimate that in 2013 between 15 and 25 of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital 

  

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our 1 billion credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2012 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 288 billion or approximately 325 of our total market capitalization of 888 billion 

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2012 as the sum of 

  

·   shares of our common stock outstanding of 133452411 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 4021 per share on december 31 2012 or 537 billion 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class e preferred stock of 220 million 

·   aggregate liquidation value par value of 2500 per share of the class f preferred stock of 4088 million 

·   outstanding borrowings of 1580 million on our credit facility 

·   outstanding mortgages payable of 1759 million and 

·   outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 255 billion 

  

at the close of the acquisition of arct on january 22 2013 our total market capitalization increased to over 12 billion 

  

investment philosophy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level or fixed increases we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm leases coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property expenses generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

investment strategy 

when identifying new properties for acquisition we generally focus on providing capital to owners and operators of commercial enterprises by acquiring the real estate they consider important to the successful operation of their business 

  

  

we primarily focus on acquiring properties leased to commercial enterprises based on the following guidelines 

  

·   tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow 

·   tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources 

·   large owners and users of real estate 

·   real estate that is critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue ie they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business 

·   real estate and tenants that are willing to sign a longterm lease 10 or more years and 

·   property transactions where we can achieve an attractive spread over our cost of capital 

  

historically our investment focus has primarily been on commercial enterprises that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2012 approximately 701 of our retail rental revenue was derived from tenants with a service component in their business we believe these serviceoriented businesses would generally be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internetbased businesses 

  

credit strategy 

we typically acquire and lease properties to regional and national commercial enterprises and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return since 1970 our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 

  

we believe the principal financial obligations of most commercial enterprises typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligations is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable and critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

  

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a fourpart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

  

·   industry company market conditions and credit profile 

·   store profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available 

·   the importance of the real estate location to the operations of the company’s business and 

·   overall real estate characteristics including property value and comparative rental rates 

  

acquisition strategy 

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national commercial enterprises are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale strong consumer brands advertising and the selection of prime locations our acquisition strategy is to act as a source of capital to regional and national commercial enterprises by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations in addition we frequently acquire large portfolios of properties net leased to multiple tenants in a variety of industries we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting potential investments we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

  

·   properties that are freestanding commerciallyzoned with a single tenant 

·   properties that are important locations for regional and national commercial enterprises 

  

  

·   properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants andor can generally be characterized as important to the operations of the company’s business 

·   properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our tenants with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares and 

·   properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm netlease agreements offering both current income and the potential for rent increases 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 

  

portfolio management strategy 

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing our credit quality 

  

our executives regularly review and analyze 

·   the performance of the various industries of our tenants and 

·   the operation management business planning and financial condition of our tenants 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

·   generate higher returns 

·   enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

·   extend our average remaining lease term or 

·   decrease tenant or industry concentration 

  

at december 31 2012 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 192 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2013 we intend to continue implementing more active disposition efforts to further enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio as a result we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 50 million and 125 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties 

  

universal shelf registration 

in october 2012 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in october 2015 this replaces our prior shelf registration statement in accordance with sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include 1 common stock 2 preferred stock 3 debt securities 4 depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock 5 warrants to purchase debt securities common stock preferred stock or depositary shares and 6 any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

  

  

1 billion acquisition credit facility 

in may 2012 we entered into a new 1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility which replaced our 425 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in march 2014 the initial term of the new credit facility expires in may 2016 and includes at our option a oneyear extension under this new credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling we also have other interest rate options available to us our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation at december 31 2012 we had a borrowing capacity of 842 million available on our credit facility subject to customary conditions to borrowing and an outstanding balance of 158 million the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our new credit facility at december 31 2012 was 13 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2012 we remain in compliance with these covenants 

  

we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 500 million to a total borrowing capacity of 15 billion any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter when capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

cash reserves 

we acquire and lease properties and distribute to stockholders in the form of monthly cash dividends a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 52 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility

we have no unconsolidated investments nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts additionally we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as such our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

competitive strategy 

to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

  

·   type of investment properties we believe netleased properties whether purchased individually or as part of larger portfolio purchases represent an attractive investment opportunity in today’s real estate environment the less intensive daytoday property management required by netlease agreements coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of properties is an effective investment strategy the tenants of our freestanding properties generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs in order to grow and expand they generally need capital since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these tenants our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back under a netlease arrangement allows the commercial enterprise to free up capital 

  

·   investment in new industries we seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of industries we believe diversification will allow us to invest in industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find attractive when analyzing new industries we seek to acquire properties that are critical to the success of a commercial enterprise through its distribution of the product or service other characteristics may include but are not limited to industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national commercial enterprises can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations as well as capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base 

  

·   diversification diversification of the portfolio by industry type tenant and geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for our stockholders therefore further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective at december 31 2012 we owned a diversified property portfolio that consisted of 3013 properties located in 49 states leased to 150 different commercial enterprises doing business in 44 industry segments each of the 44 industry segments represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for no more than 149 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2012 

  

  

·   management specialization we believe that our management’s specialization in acquiring and managing singletenant properties operated under netlease agreements purchased individually or as part of a larger portfolio is important to meeting our objectives we plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train highquality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership finance and management 

  

·   technology we intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to carry out our operations efficiently and economically we maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio’s performance and actively manage our investments we believe that technology and informationbased systems play an important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants

environmental practices   our focus on energy related matters is demonstrated by how we manage our daytoday activities in our corporate headquarters building with respect to other properties that we own which are netleased to our tenants who are responsible for maintaining the buildings we encourage energy conservation and environmental sustainability practices wherever possible in our headquarters building we promote energy conservation and encourage the following practices

 item 1a risk factors 

  

this “risk factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders” unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock 

  

  

in order to grow w e need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

  

·   businesses 

·   individuals 

·   fiduciary accounts and plans and 

·   other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

  

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

  

·   lack of demand in areas where our properties are located 

·   inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants 

·   oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates 

·   declines in our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent which may be affected by their operations the current economic situation and competition within their industries from other operators 

·   defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations 

·   economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located and 

·   deterioration of physical condition of our properties 

  

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us 

  

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against the tenant for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as a result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect cash from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness 

  

  

eightyfour of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2012 all but one of which were singletenant properties at december 31 2012 32 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2012 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

for the fourth quarter of 2012 our tenants in the “convenience stores” industry accounted for 149 of our rental revenue a downturn in this industry whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect tenants in this industry which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock 

  

we believe that the ongoing economic recession has also had an adverse effect on many casual dining restaurants the impact of bankruptcy filings by any tenants in the casual dining industry could adversely affect us individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for the fourth quarter of 2012 nevertheless downturns in these other industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common and preferred stock in addition we may in the future make additional investments in the “convenience stores” industry which would increase this industry’s percentage of our rental revenues thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in this industry would have on us 

  

in addition a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket retail and other commercial enterprises that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail and other commercial enterprises and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional national or international economy 

  

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant netlease retail locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states and properties leased to tenants engaged in nonretail businesses these risks may include a limited knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the tenant operates limited experience in managing certain types of new properties new types of real estate locations and lease structures and the laws and culture of any nonus jurisdiction 

  

the acquisition of american realty capital trust inc presents certain risks to our business and operations 

on january 22 2013 we completed our acquisition of american realty capital trust inc or arct in a transaction valued at approximately 31 billion pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement at the effective time of the acquisition each outstanding share of arct common stock was converted into 035 of cash and 02874 shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition we paid 5529 million at closing to repay amounts then outstanding and terminated the commitments under arct’s revolving credit facility in conjunction with our acquisition of arct in january 2013 we assumed approximately 5163 million of mortgages payable with this acquisition we added 515 properties to our portfolio 

  

the acquisition presents certain risks to our business and operations including among other things the following 

  

·   we may encounter difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating arct’s properties and systems into our operations and systems and in any event the integration may require a substantial amount of time on the part of both our management and employees and therefore divert their attention from other aspects of our business 

  

  

·   arct’s real estate portfolio includes a number of industries which are new to us including us general services administration assets as well as tenants in the aerospace financial services freight health care home maintenance manufacturing pharmacy retail banking technology and telecommunications businesses 

  

·   we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of arct or those benefits may be less than we and securities and industry analysts had anticipated which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities 

  

·   our level of indebtedness has increased in conjunction with the acquisition of arct 

  

·   our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded portfolio 

  

·   the market price of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities may decline particularly if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the arct acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by securities or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisition on our results of operations and financial condition is not consistent with the expectations of these analysts 

  

·   we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue paying dividends on our common stock or preferred stock at the current rates 

  

·   if arct failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes realty income may inherit significant tax liabilities and realty income could lose its reit status should disqualifying activities continue after the acquisition 

  

·   we may incur unanticipated capital expenditures in order to maintain or improve the properties and businesses of arct 

  

·   we may encounter difficulties in managing a substantially larger and more complex business with properties in new geographic areas 

  

·   many of arct’s tenants operated in industries where we do not have any prior experience which may make it difficult for us to evaluate their business and operations and the arct acquisition increased our tenant concentration in certain industries 

  

·   we may need to implement or improve internal controls procedures policies and systems with respect to arct’s properties and businesses which may require substantial time and expenditure 

  

·   we may continue to incur substantial expenses related to the acquisition including legal accounting and financial advisory expenses 

  

·   we may be required to recognize writeoffs impairment charges or amortization charges resulting from the arct acquisition and 

  

·   we may encounter unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the acquired businesses and properties 

  

in addition eight lawsuits were filed in conjunction with the acquisition of arct all of the below actions name as defendants arct members of the arct board of directors realty income and tau acquisition llc a delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of realty income or merger sub in each case the plaintiffs allege that the arct directors breached their fiduciary duties to arct andor its stockholders in negotiating and approving the agreement that the acquisition consideration negotiated in the agreement improperly values arct that the arct stockholders will not receive fair value for their arct common stock in the acquisition and that the terms of the agreement impose improper dealprotection devices that purportedly preclude competing offers the complaints further allege that realty income merger sub and in some cases arct aided and abetted those alleged breaches of fiduciary duty the various amended complaints add allegations that disclosures regarding the merger in the joint proxy statementprospectus filed on october 1 2012 or the definitive proxy statementprospectus filed on december 6 2012 are inadequate plaintiffs seek 

  

  

injunctive relief including enjoining or rescinding the acquisition and an award of other unspecified attorneys’ and other fees and costs in addition to other relief realty income believes that these actions have no merit and intends to respond to them in due course

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

·   our knowledge of the contamination 

·   the timing of the contamination 

·   the cause of the contamination or 

·   the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by us in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

it is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result should our tenants or their employees or customers be exposed to mold at any of our properties we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property which would reduce our cash available for distribution in addition exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise 

  

compliance   we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

  

  

insurance and indemnity   in july 2012 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy which expires in july 2022 and replaced our previous sevenyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 60 million in the aggregate the limits on the excess policy are 5 million per occurrence and 10 million in the aggregate therefore the primary and excess tenyear policies together provide a total limit of 15 million per occurrence and 70 million in the aggregate 

  

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

  

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

  

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

·   we would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

·   we would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed to our stockholders 

·   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

·   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

·   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax in addition our taxable reit subsidiaries including crest are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property 

  

  

distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 1 billion acquisition credit facility at december 31 2012 we had 158 million of outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility a total of 255 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities and 1759 million of outstanding mortgage debt to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our acquisition credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis which includes concerns that certain european countries may be unable to repay their national debt we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our acquisition credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

  

in addition our acquisition credit facility contains provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our acquisition credit facility provides that if an event of default as defined in the credit facility exists neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make any distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

  

·   the sum of a 95 of our adjusted funds from operations as defined by the credit facility agreement for that period plus b the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period and 

·   the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our shareholders in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

  

except that we may repurchase or redeem preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock the acquisition credit facility further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to any of our subsidiaries 

  

  

that have guaranteed amounts payable under the credit facility or that meet a significance test set forth in the credit facility we and our subsidiaries may not pay any distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under our acquisition credit facility were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or prevent us from paying those distributions altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit 

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock including 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 

·   requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 

·   limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

·   putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

  

if we default under a mortgage loan we will automatically be in default of any other loan that has crossdefault provisions and we may lose the properties securing these loans 

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time including 

  

·   prevailing interest rates increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities 

·   the market for similar securities issued by other reits 

·   general economic and financial market conditions 

·   the financial condition performance and prospects of us our tenants and our competitors 

·   changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us our competitors or our industry 

·   changes in our credit ratings and 

·   actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors 

  

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock and debt securities in the us trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

   

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between 1000000 and 10000000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders given the recent disruptions in the insurance industry we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

  

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the netlease industry 

  

terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or us businesses these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants 

  

if events like these were to occur they could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last several years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably in addition the ongoing global financial crisis which includes concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar effect these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing unrest in certain middle eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at 

  

  

reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

  

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent 

  

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values which are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability which can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the sec is currently considering whether issuers in the us should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards or ifrs instead of us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap ifrs is a comprehensive set of accounting standards promulgated by the international accounting standards board or iasb which are rapidly gaining worldwide acceptance if the sec decides to require ifrs it expects that us issuers would first report under the new standards beginning in approximately 2015 or later although the timeframe has not been finalized additionally the financial accounting standards board or fasb is considering various changes to gaap some of which may be significant as part of a joint effort with the iasb to converge accounting standards although the fasb and iasb currently have a project on their agenda to examine the accounting for leases the project may not result in the issuance of a final standard or a standard that would be comparable to current gaap if ifrs is adopted the potential issues associated with lease accounting along with other potential changes associated with the adoption or convergence with ifrs may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

realty income the monthly dividend company ®  is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations our monthly distributions or dividends are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to commercial enterprises we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal credit research real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 44 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements 

  

in 1994 realty income was listed upon the new york stock exchange and we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains 

  

we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 

  

at december 31 2012 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

·   of 3013 properties 

·   with an occupancy rate of 972 or 2929 properties leased and only 84 properties available for lease 

·   leased to 150 different commercial enterprises doing business in 44 separate industries 

·   located in 49 states 

·   with over 376 million square feet of leasable space and 

·   with an average leasable space per property of approximately 12500 square feet 

  

of the 3013 properties in the portfolio 2996 or 994 are singletenant properties and the remaining 17 are multitenant properties at december 31 2012 of the 2996 singletenant properties 2913 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 110 years 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our 1 billion credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings 

  

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2012 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 288 billion or approximately 325 of our total market capitalization of 888 billion 

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2012 as the sum of 

   

  

at the close of the acquisition of american realty capital trust inc or arct on january 22 2013 our total market capitalization increased to over 12 billion 

  

notes receivable 

as of december 31 2012 we had 632 million in notes receivable which are secured by the properties on which the note receivables were placed included in this amount are 351 million of notes receivable acquired in 2012 88 million of notes receivable acquired in 2011 189 million of notes receivable held by our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiary crest and 04 million of notes receivable from a property sale 

  

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2012 we had 1659 million of mortgages payable which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions in 2012 and 2011 additionally at december 31 2012 we had net premiums totaling 99 million on these mortgages during 2012 we paid 117 million in principal payments which includes 107 million to pay off one mortgage in march 2012 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct in january 2013 we assumed approximately 5163 million of mortgages payable 

  

we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties and costs make it economically feasible to do so we intend to continue our policy of primarily identifying property acquisitions that are free from mortgage indebtedness 

  

1 billion acquisition credit facility 

in may 2012 we entered into a new 1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility which replaced our 425 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in march 2014 the initial term of the new credit facility expires in may 2016 and includes at our option a oneyear extension under this new credit facility our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling we also have other interest rate options available to us our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation at december 31 2012 we had a borrowing capacity of 842 million available on our credit facility subject to customary conditions to borrowing and an outstanding balance of 158 million the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our new credit facility at december 31 2012 was 13 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2012 we remain in compliance with these covenants 

  

we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 500 million to a total borrowing capacity of 15 billion any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 

  

  

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 52 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

acquisitions during 2012 

during 2012 realty income invested 116 billion in real estate acquiring 423 properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 72 the majority of the lease revenue from these properties is generated from investment grade tenants these 423 properties and properties under development are located in 37 states will contain over 105 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 146 years the tenants of the 423 properties acquired operate in 23 industries aerospace apparel stores automotive collision services automotive parts consumer appliances consumer goods convenience stores crafts and novelties diversified industrial dollar stores drug stores equipment services food processing health and fitness insurance machinery motor vehicle dealerships packaging paper restaurants – quick service theaters transportation services and wholesale clubs none of the investments in these properties caused any one tenant to be 10 or more of our total assets at december 31 2012 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent or in the case of a property under development the estimated base rent for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total cost of the properties since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

of the 116 billion realty income invested in 2012 approximately 351 million was used to originate a note receivable which is secured by the properties on which the note receivable was placed 

  

during 2012 crest invested 890000 in one property in the restaurant – casual industry 

  

january 2013 acquisition of american realty capital trust inc 

on january 22 2013 we completed our acquisition of arct in a transaction valued at approximately 31 billion pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement and plan of merger dated as of september 6 2012 as amended on january 6 2013 at the effective time of the acquisition each outstanding share of arct common stock was converted into the right to receive a combination of i 035 in cash and ii 02874 shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition at the closing we terminated and repaid the amounts then outstanding of approximately 5529 million under arct’s revolving credit facility and term loan in conjunction with our acquisition of arct in january 2013 we assumed approximately 5163 million of mortgages payable with this acquisition we added 515 properties to our portfolio through 2012 we have incurred 79 million of merger costs we anticipate that the total merger costs will be approximately 19 million 

  

in january 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of arct we entered into a 70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing january 21 2018 borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor plus 120 in conjunction with this term loan we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 215 

  

  

portfolio discussion 

  

leasing results 

at december 31 2012 we had 84 properties available for lease out of 3013 properties in our portfolio which represents a 972 occupancy rate since december 31 2011 when we reported 87 properties available for lease and a 967 occupancy rate we 

  

·   leased 47 properties 

·   sold 20 properties available for lease and 

·   have 64 new properties available for lease 

  

during 2012 124 properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants the rent on these leases was 106 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 109 million at december 31 2012 our average annualized rental revenue per square foot was approximately 1456 per square foot on the 2929 leased properties in our portfolio at december 31 2012 we classified 14 properties with a carrying amount of 192 million as held for sale on our balance sheet 

  

investments in existing properties 

in 2012 we capitalized costs of 66 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 162 million for releasing costs and 493 million for building and tenant improvements in 2011 we capitalized costs of 42 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 17 million for releasing costs and 25 million for building improvements 

  

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

the majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market credit worthiness and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise during certain periods the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continually monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly see our discussion of “risk factors” in this annual report 

  

increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders 

we continue our 44year policy of paying monthly dividends monthly dividends per common share increased by 00003125 in april 2012 to 01458125 increased by 00003125 in july 2012 to 0146125 increased by 0005 in september 2012 to 0151125 increased by 00003125 in october 2012 to 01514375 increased by 00003125 in january 2013 to 015175 and increased by 00291667 in february 2013 to 01809167 the increase in january 2013 was our 61 st consecutive quarterly increase and the increase in february 2013 was our 70 th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2012 we paid three monthly cash dividends per common share in the amount of 01455 three in the amount of 01458125 two in the amount of 0146125 one in the amount of 0151125 and three in the amount of 01514375 totaling 1771625 in december 2012 we declared dividends of 015175 per share which were paid in january 2013 in january 2013 and february 2013 we declared dividends of 01809167 per share which will be paid in february 2013 and march 2013 respectively 

  

  

the current monthly dividend of 01809167 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 2171 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 50 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 4340 on february 1 2013 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period

issuances and redemption of preferred stock 

in february 2012 we issued 1495 million shares of our 6625 monthly income class f cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a price of 2500 per share including 195 million shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their overallotment option in april 2012 we issued an additional 14 million shares of our class f preferred stock at a price 252863 per share of the aggregate net proceeds of approximately 3954 million from these issuances 1275 million was used to redeem all of our outstanding 7375 monthly income class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock and the balance was used to repay 

  

  

borrowings under our credit facility the dividend rate difference of 075 between the class d and class f preferred stock provides us savings of 956000 annually on the class d redemption amount of 1275 million beginning february 15 2017 the class f preferred shares are redeemable at our option for 2500 per share the initial dividend of 01702257 per share was paid on march 15 2012 and covered 37 days thereafter dividends of 0138021 per share will be paid monthly in arrears

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

in march 2011 we established a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or the dspp to provide our common shareholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions the dspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions the dspp authorizes up to 6000000 common shares to be issued during 2012 we issued 55598 shares and raised approximately 22 million under the dspp from the inception of the dspp through december 31 2012 we have issued 115203 shares and raised approximately 42 million 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable” outlook moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a “negative” outlook and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb with a “stable outlook” to our senior notes 

  

based on our current ratings the credit facility interest rate is libor plus 1075 with a facility commitment fee of 0175 for allin drawn pricing of 125 over libor the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 185 if our credit facility is lower than bbbbaa3 and ii libor plus 100 if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which range from i 045 for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 and ii 015 for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

  

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions in addition if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2012 sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 

  

   

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually all of these notes and bonds contain various covenants including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60 ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40 iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 15 times and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150 of our outstanding unsecured debt at december 31 2012 we remain in compliance with these covenants 

  

in march 2013 we expect to repay 100 million of our 5375 notes by utilizing our credit facility 

  

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes these calculations which are not based on us gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our notes only and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2012 are 

  

   

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2012 dollars in millions 

  

table of obligations 

  

   

1   the initial term of the credit facility expires in may 2016 and includes at our option a oneyear extension 

2   excludes net premiums recorded on the mortgages payable the balance of these net premiums at december 31 2012 is 99 million 

3   interest on the credit facility notes bonds and mortgages payable has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december 31 2012 through their respective maturity dates 

4   realty income currently pays the ground lessors directly for the rent under the ground leases 

5   our tenants who are generally subtenants under ground leases are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases in the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent we are primarily responsible 

6   “other” consists of 160 million of commitments under construction contracts and 944000 of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 

  

our credit facility and notes payable obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

  

preferred stock outstanding 

in 2006 we issued 88 million shares of 675 class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock beginning december 7 2011 shares of class e preferred stock were redeemable at our option for 2500 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class e preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears

no unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated investments nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts additionally we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as such our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight–line method over an estimated useful life of 25 to 35 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 to 35 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 

  

when acquiring a property we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket or belowmarket lease value of inplace leases the value of inplace leases and tenant relationships as applicable in addition any assumed mortgages receivable or payable are recorded at their estimated fair values 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment they could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

  

rental revenue 

rental revenue was 4737 million for 2012 versus 4086 million for 2011 an increase of 651 million or 159 rental revenue was 3328 million in 2010 the increase in rental revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily attributable to 

  

·   the 423 properties 106 million square feet acquired by realty income in 2012 which generated 227 million of rent in 2012 

·   the 164 properties 62 million square feet acquired by realty income in 2011 which generated 790 million of rent in 2012 compared to 315 million in 2011 an increase of 475 million 

·   same store rents generated on 2220 properties 186 million square feet during the entire years of 2012 and 2011 increased by 364000 or 01 to 3604 million from 3600 million 

·   a net decrease of 84 million relating to the aggregate of i rental revenue from properties 13 million square feet that were available for lease during part of 2012 or 2011 ii rental revenue related to 70 properties sold during 2012 and 2011 and iii lease termination settlements which in aggregate totaled 78 million in 2012 compared to 162 million in 2011 and 

·   a net increase in straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to rent of 23 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 

  

for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were available for lease at any time ii were under development iii we have made an additional investment in iv were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced and v were released with rentfree periods each of the exclusions from the same store pool is separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

  

of the 3013 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2012 2996 or 994 are singletenant properties and the remaining 17 are multitenant properties of the 2996 singletenant properties 2913 or 972 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 110 years at december 31 2012 of our 2913 leased singletenant properties 2681 or 920 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

·   primarily base rent increases tied to a consumer price index typically subject to ceilings 

·   percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales 

·   fixed increases or 

·   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 20 million in 2012 14 million in 2011 and 13 million in 2010 excluding percentage rent reclassified to discontinued operations of 124000 in 2012 60000 in 2011 and 104000 in 2010 percentage rent in 2012 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2013 

  

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to regional and national commercial enterprises under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2012 our portfolio of 3013 properties was 972 leased with 84 properties available for lease as compared to 87 at december 31 2011 it has been our experience that approximately 2 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 

  

  

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 1496 million in 2012 compared to 1189 million in 2011 and 916 million in 2010 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2012 and 2011 were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2012 and 2011 which was partially offset by property sales in those same years as discussed in the sections entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders” and “adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo normalized ffo and affo 

  

interest expense 

interest expense was 1225 million in 2012 compared to 1083 million in 2011 and 932 million in 2010 the increase in interest expense from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in borrowings attributable to the 150 million reopening of our 5875 senior unsecured bonds due 2035 in june 2011 the issuance of our 200 senior unsecured notes due january 2018 in october 2012 and the issuance of our 325 senior unsecured notes due october 2022 in october 2012 interest on our mortgages payable and higher credit facility borrowings which were partially offset by lower average interest rates 

  

as a result of entering into our new credit facility we incurred credit facility origination costs of 71 million at december 31 2012 59 million of the 71 million is included in other assets net on our consolidated balance sheet along with 22 million incurred as a result of entering into our previous credit facilities these costs are being amortized over the remaining term of our current 1 billion credit facility 

  

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

at december 31 2012 the weighted average interest rate on our 

  

·   notes and bonds payable of 255 billion was 499 

·   mortgages payable of 1759 million was 438 

·   credit facility outstanding borrowings of 1580 million was 128 and 

·   combined outstanding notes bonds mortgages and credit facility borrowings of 29 billion was 475 

  

ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures our ebitda and adjusted ebitda computation may not be comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda reported by other companies that interpret the definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do management believes ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be meaningful measures of a reit’s performance because they are widely followed by industry analysts lenders and investors and are used by management as measures of performance in addition management utilizes adjusted ebitda because our 1 billion credit facility uses a similar metric to measure our compliance with certain covenants ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be considered along with but not as alternatives to net income as measures of our operating performance 

  

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income our most directly comparable gaap measure to adjusted ebitda dollars in thousands 

  

   

interest coverage ratio 

interest coverage ratio is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by interest expense including interest recorded as discontinued operations and amortization of net premiums on mortgages payable we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

   

1 see below reconciliation of interest expense used for calculation of interest coverage ratio dollars in thousands 

  

   

fixed charge coverage ratio 

fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures or information presented in exhibit 121 to this annual report 

  

   

1   see footnote 1 above for reconciliation of interest expense used for calculation of fixed charge coverage ratio this calculation excludes the charge of 37 million for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the class d preferred shares redeemed during 2012 

  

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased by 70 million to 380 million in 2012 as compared to 310 million in 2011 general and administrative expenses were 253 million in 2010 included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs of 24 million for 2012 15 million for 2011 and 368000 for 2010 general and administrative expenses increased during 2012 primarily due to increases in employee costs acquisition transaction costs and proxy costs in february 2013 we had 97 employees as compared to 83 employees in february 2012 and 79 employees in february 2011 

  

   

1 excludes gain on sales 

  

property expenses

property expenses were 73 million in 2012 60 million in 2011 and 58 million in 2010 the increase in property expenses in 2012 is primarily attributable to higher insurance costs maintenance and utilities and legal fees associated with properties available for lease partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense 

  

mergerrelated costs 

mergerrelated costs include but are not limited to advisor fees legal fees accounting fees printing fees and transfer taxes related to our acquisition of arct mergerrelated costs were 79 million in 2012 on a diluted per common share basis this expense represented 006

crest’s assets and property sales 

at december 31 2012 crest had an inventory of four properties three of which are classified as held for investment in addition to the four properties crest also held notes receivable of 189 million at december 31 2012 and 190 million at december 31 2011 during 2011 the principal balance of one note receivable was paid in full from which we received proceeds of approximately 29 million

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

during 2012 we sold 44 investment properties for 506 million which resulted in a gain of 99 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

  

during 2011 we sold 26 investment properties for 220 million which resulted in a gain of 52 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations additionally we sold excess real estate from five properties for 21 million which resulted in a gain of 540000 this gain is included in other revenue on our consolidated statement of income for 2011 because this excess real estate was associated with properties that continue to be owned as part of our core operations 

  

during 2010 we sold 28 investment properties and excess land from one property for 272 million which resulted in a gain of 87 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

  

·   generate higher returns 

·   enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 

·   extend our average remaining lease term or 

·   decrease tenant or industry concentration 

  

at december 31 2012 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 192 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2013 we intend to continue implementing more active disposition efforts to further enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio as a result we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 50 million and 125 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties

during 2010 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 213000 on four properties provisions for impairment of 171000 are included in income from discontinued operations since one of these properties was subsequently reclassified from held for sale to held for investment during 2011 a provision for impairment of 42000 is included in income from continuing operations 

  

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock dividends totaled 409 million in 2012 and 243 million in 2011 and 2010 

  

excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

when we redeemed our class d preferred stock in march 2012 we incurred a charge of 37 million for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value this charge representing the class d preferred stock original issuance cost that was paid in 2004 was recorded as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders when the shares were redeemed during 2012 on a diluted per common share basis this charge was 003 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1145 million in 2012 a decrease of 183 million as compared to 1328 million in 2011 net income available to common stockholders in 2010 was 1065 million net income available to common stockholders for 2012 includes 79 million of mergerrelated costs which represents 006 on a diluted per common share basis for the acquisition of arct additionally net income available to common stockholders in 2012 includes a 37 million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the shares of our class d preferred stock which represents 003 on a diluted per common share basis 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties and excess real estate the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

gains from the sale of properties during 2012 were 99 million as compared to gains from the sale of properties and excess real estate of 57 million during 2011 and an 87 million gain from the sale of properties during 2010 

  

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders normalized ffo 

  

ffo for 2012 increased by 115 million or 46 to 2609 million as compared to 2494 million in 2011 and 1939 million in 2010 ffo for 2012 includes 79 million for mergerrelated costs and also includes a 37 million charge associated with the class d preferred stock redemption 

  

we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding the mergerrelated costs for our 2013 acquisition of arct normalized ffo for 2012 increased by 194 million or 78 to 2688 million as compared to 2494 million in 2011 and 1939 million in 2010 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and normalized ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

  

   

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets reduced by gains on the sale of investment properties and extraordinary items we define normalized ffo a nongaap measure as ffo excluding the mergerrelated costs for our 2013 acquisition of arct 

  

we consider ffo and normalized ffo to be appropriate supplemental measures of a reit’s operating performance as they are based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo and adds back mergerrelated costs for normalized ffo the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

  

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

  

affo for 2012 increased by 208 million or 82 to 2742 million as compared to 2534 million in 2011 and 1973 million in 2010 we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term “cad” for cash available for distribution “fad” for funds available for distribution or other terms 

  

  

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo normalized ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

1   see reconciling items for ffo presented under “funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and normalized funds from operations available to common stockholders normalized ffo” 

2   includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our senior notes were issued in march 2003 november 2003 march 2005 september 2005 september 2006 september 2007 june 2010 june 2011 and october 2012 additionally this includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred and capitalized in connection with our assumption of the mortgages payable these costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

3   includes straightline rent revenue and the amortization of above and belowmarket leases 

  

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure by which to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to the measurement of the particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

  

presentation of the information regarding ffo normalized ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo normalized ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo normalized ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance ffo normalized ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating 

  

  

investing and financing activities in addition ffo normalized ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

  

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

of our 3013 properties in our portfolio approximately 967 or 2913 are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

as of december 31 2012 the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business is not considered to be material 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates 

  

in order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks including counterparty credit risk the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2012 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  

expected maturity data 

  

   

1   100 million of fixed rate senior notes mature in march 2013 229 million of fixed rate mortgages mature and 152000 of a variable rate mortgage mature in 2013 

2   135 million of fixed rate mortgages and 161000 of a variable rate mortgage mature in 2014 

3   150 million of fixed rate senior notes mature in november 2015 23 million of fixed rate mortgages and 238 million of variable rate 

  

  

mortgages mature in 2015 the interest rate on variable rate mortgages of 236 million is capped at 55 

4   275 million of fixed rate senior notes mature in september 2016 143 million of fixed rate mortgages and 181000 of a variable rate mortgage mature in 2016 additionally the credit facility expires in may 2016 

5 175 million of fixed rate senior notes mature in september 2017 451 million of fixed rate mortgages and 194000 of a variable rate mortgage mature in 2017 

6 as it relates to fixed rate senior notes 350 million matures in january 2018 550 million matures in august 2019 250 million matures in january 2021 450 million matures in october 2022 and 250 million matures in march 2035 additionally 358 million of fixed rate mortgages and 75 million of a variable rate mortgage mature at dates thereafter 

7 excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable the balance of these net premiums is 99 million at december 31 2012 

8 we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes at december 31 2012 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our notes payable we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at december 31 2012 on the current 5year 7year or 10year treasury yield curve plus an applicable creditadjusted spread we believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance reasonably approximates its estimated fair value at december 31 2012 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2012 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates all of our mortgages payable except two have fixed interest rates interest on our credit facility balance is variable based on our credit facility balance of 1580 million at december 31 2012 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 16 million per year 

  




 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  

  




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control–integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting

paul m meurer chief financial officer executive vice president and treasurer 

  

  

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2012 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

recent developments 

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

we continue our 43year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per common share increased by 00003125 in april 2011 to 01445625 in july 2011 to 0144875 in october 2011 to 01451875 and in january 2012 to 01455 the increase in january 2012 was our 57 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 64 th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2011 we paid three monthly cash distributions per common share in the amount of 014425 three in the amount of 01445625 three in the amount of 0144875 and three in the amount of 01451875 totaling 1736625 in december 2011 january 2012 and february 2012 we declared distributions of 01455 per share which were paid in january 2012 and will be paid in february 2012 and march 2012 respectively 

the current monthly distribution of 01455 per share represents an annualized distribution of 1746 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 50 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 3496 on december 31 2011 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

acquisitions during 2011 

during 2011 we invested 102 billion in 164 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 78 the majority of the lease revenue from these properties will be generated from tenants that have investment grade ratings on their senior debt securities these 164 new properties and properties under development are located in 26 states contain over 62 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 134 years 

 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent or in the case of a property under development the estimated base rent for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total cost of the properties since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

included in the 102 billion invested during 2011 are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portfolio discussion 

 

leasing results 

at december 31 2011 we had 87 properties available for lease out of 2634 properties in our portfolio which represents a 967 occupancy rate since december 31 2010 when we reported 84 properties available for lease and a 966 occupancy rate we 

 

 

 

 

during 2011 89 properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants the rent on these leases was 96 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 104 million at december 31 2011 our average annualized rental revenue per square foot was approximately 1706 

matters pertaining to certain tenants 

in january 2012 friendly ice cream corporation or friendly’s one of our tenants announced that it was emerging from voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code which they had filed for in october 2011 pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings friendly’s accepted 102 of their 121 leases with us friendly’s rejected 19 leases with us representing approximately 18 million of annualized rent and received rent concessions and term reductions on some of their accepted leases with us we estimate that we will recover approximately 80 of the 161 million of annualized rent that friendly’s was paying the company before the bankruptcy filing 

additionally in january 2012 buffets holding inc or buffets another one of our tenants filed for voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code buffets leases 86 properties from us that as of december 31 2011 represented approximately 182 million or approximately 39 of our annualized rental revenue buffets rejected the leases on seven of our 86 properties representing approximately 18 million of annualized rent additionally we have reached a preliminary agreement subject to bankruptcy court approval with buffets regarding rent concessions and term reductions on some of buffets’ other leases with us overall postbankruptcy we estimate that we will recover approximately 65 of the 182 million of annualized rent that buffets was paying us before the bankruptcy filing friendly’s and buffets both operate casual dining restaurants 

 

for both friendly’s and buffets any properties returned to us are immediately available for release to other tenants we believe that demand in the market for the rejected properties will allow us to find suitable replacement tenants within the next 18 months however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding replacement tenants for these properties within this timeframe or at all or that friendly’s or buffets will continue to pay rent for the remainder of the lease terms on their accepted leases 

  

  

  

in addition we have recently concluded an analysis of our portfolio and have identified other tenants whose leases represented approximately 2 to 3 of our total annualized rent as of december 31 2011 that we believe may make similar bankruptcy filings in 2012 however the foregoing percentages are estimates and are subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties and the actual percentage of annualized rent represented by other tenants who make bankruptcy filings during 2012 may be different 

investments in existing properties 

in 2011 we capitalized costs of 42 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 17 million for releasing costs and 25 million for building and tenant improvements in 2010 we capitalized costs of 36 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 15 million for releasing costs and 21 million for building improvements 

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

the majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market credit worthiness and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

issuance of preferred stock 

in february 2012 we issued 1495 million shares of 6625 monthly income class f cumulative redeemable preferred stock including 195 million shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their overallotment option the net proceeds of approximately 3617 million from this issuance will be used to redeem the outstanding class d preferred stock repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes beginning february 15 2017 the class f preferred shares are redeemable at our option for 2500 per share the initial dividend of 01702257 per share will be paid on march 15 2012 and will cover 37 days thereafter dividends of 01380208 per share will be paid monthly 

redemption of preferred stock 

in january 2012 we announced that we plan to redeem our outstanding class d preferred stock on march 1 2012 we will redeem the class d preferred stock at 2500 per share plus accrued dividends 

issuance of common stock 

in september 2011 we issued 6300000 shares of common stock at a price of 3400 per share after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of 106 million the net proceeds of 2036 million were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility which were used to fund recent acquisitions 

in march 2011 we issued 8625000 shares of common stock at a price of 3481 per share after underwriting discounts and offering costs of 146 million the net proceeds of 2856 million were used to fund property acquisitions 

reopening of unsecured bonds due 2035 

in june 2011 we “reopened” our 5875 senior unsecured bonds due 2035 or the 2035 bonds and issued 150 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 2035 bonds the public offering price for the additional 2035 bonds was 94578 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6318 per annum those 2035 bonds constituted an additional issuance of and a single series with the 100 million in aggregate principal amount of 2035 bonds that we issued in march 2005 the net proceeds of 1401 million were used to fund property acquisitions 

  

  

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

in march 2011 we established a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or the plan to provide our common shareholders as well as new investors with a convenient and economical method to purchase our common stock andor reinvest their distributions the plan authorizes up to 6000000 common shares to be issued through december 31 2011 we issued 59605 shares and received net proceeds of approximately 19 million under the plan 

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1328 million in 2011 versus 1065 million in 2010 an increase of 263 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 105 in 2011 as compared to 101 in 2010 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties and excess land the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

the gain from the sale of properties and excess real estate during 2011 was 57 million as compared to 87 million during 2010 

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

in 2011 our ffo increased by 555 million or 286 to 2494 million versus 1939 million in 2010 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 198 in 2011 compared to 183 in 2010 an increase of 015 or 82 

see our discussion of ffo which is not a financial measure under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo in the section entitled management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report 

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

in 2011 our affo increased by 561 million or 284 to 2534 million versus 1973 million in 2010 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 201 in 2011 compared to 186 in 2010 an increase of 015 or 81 

see our discussion of affo which is not a financial measure under us gaap which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and affo in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report 

 

distribution policy 

distributions are paid monthly to our common class d preferred and class e preferred stockholders if and when declared by our board of directors 

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income including net capital gains in 2011 our cash distributions totaled 2436 million or approximately 1277 of our estimated taxable income of 1908 million our estimated reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated reit taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit distribution requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or performance 

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our 2011 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 2193 million representing 879 of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of 2494 million 

  

  

the class d preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 184375 per annum per share on january 31 2012 we announced that the class d preferred stock would be redeemed on march 1 2012 the class e preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 675 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 16875 per annum per share the class f preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6625 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 165625 per annum per share the initial class f preferred stock dividend will be paid on march 15 2012 dividends on our class d and class e preferred stock are current 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute qualified dividend income subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for qualified dividend income has generally been reduced to 15 until it “sunsets” or reverts to the provisions of prior law which under current law will occur with respect to taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the reit’s stock and the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest net lease inc or crest or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year 

distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders basis in their stock distributions above that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 206 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2011 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital 

 

business philosophy and strategy 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot provide assurance that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our 425 million credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings 

  

  

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2011 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 206 billion or approximately 291 of our total market capitalization of 706 billion 

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2011 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment philosophy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants gross sales above a specified level or fixed increases we believe that owning a portfolio of properties under longterm leases coupled with the tenants responsibility for property expenses generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

investment strategy 

when identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is generally on providing capital to owners and operators of retail and other commercial enterprises by acquiring then leasing back the real estate they consider important to the successful operation of their business 

we primarily focus on acquiring properties leased to retail and other commercial enterprises based on the following guidelines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically our investment focus has primarily been on retail and other commercial enterprises that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2011 approximately 83 of our retail rental revenue was derived from tenants with a service component in their business we believe these serviceoriented businesses would generally be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internetbased businesses 

credit strategy 

we typically acquire and lease properties to regional and national commercial enterprises and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return since 1970 our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 

  

  

we believe the principal financial obligations of most commercial enterprises typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligations is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

 

 

 

 

the typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more locations generally the properties 

 

 

 

acquisition strategy 

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national retailers and other commercial enterprises are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale strong consumer brands advertising and the selection of prime locations we execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national commercial enterprises by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting potential investments we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continue to monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly see item 1a entitled risk factors in this annual report 

  

  

portfolio management strategy 

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing our credit quality 

our executives regularly review and analyze 

 

 

 

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2011 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 22 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2012 we intend to employ more active disposition efforts to further enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio as a result we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 25 million and 60 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties 

universal shelf registration 

in march 2009 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which expires in march 2012 in accordance with the sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock preferred stock debt securities or any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering we plan to file a new shelf registration statement prior to the expiration of our existing shelf registration 

425 million acquisition credit facility 

we have a 425 million unsecured revolving credit facility the initial term of the credit facility expires in march 2014 and includes two oneyear extension options under the credit facility the current investment grade credit ratings on our debt securities provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 220 basis points over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling we also have other interest rate options available to us under the credit facility our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation at december 31 2011 we had a borrowing capacity of 1876 million available on our credit facility subject to customary conditions to borrowing and an outstanding balance of 2374 million as a result of the issuance of our class f preferred stock in february 2012 we paid off all outstanding credit facility borrowings on february 7 2012 the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2011 was 21 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2011 we remain in compliance with these covenants 

we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 200 million to a total borrowing capacity of 625 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 

  

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter when capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes all of these ratings have stable outlooks 

based on our current ratings the current facility interest rate is libor plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 220 basis points over libor the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 300 basis points if our credit facility is lower than bbbbaa3 and ii libor plus 175 basis points if our credit rating is aa3 or higher 

in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which ranges from i 50 basis points for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 and ii 30 basis points for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2011 we have 672 million of mortgages payable to thirdparty lenders that were assumed in 2011 in connection with our property acquisitions we paid 279000 in principal payments on these mortgages payable during 2011 additionally net premiums totaling 820000 in aggregate were recorded upon assumption of the mortgages payable at the time of the respective property acquisitions to account for abovemarket interest rates we recorded amortization of 189000 related to these net premiums during 2011 

our mortgages payable are secured by the properties on which the debt was placed and are nonrecourse we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties and costs make it economically feasible to do so we intend to continue our policy of primarily identifying property acquisitions that are free from mortgage indebtedness 

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in variable interest entities or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments additionally we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as such our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of offbalance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

  

competitive strategy 

we believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

this risk factors section contains references to our capital stock and to our stockholders unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our capital stock represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our stockholders represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock 

  

  

in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenants lease and material losses to us 

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenants lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against the tenant for terminated leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full or at all moreover in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as a result of its bankruptcy we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions reducing amounts we receive under those leases as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect cash from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness 

  

  

  

eightyseven of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2011 all but one of which were singletenant properties at december 31 2011 33 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2011 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

for the fourth quarter of 2011 our tenants in the “convenience stores” industry accounted for 172 of our rental revenue a downturn in this industry whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect tenants in this industry which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock 

we believe that the ongoing economic recession has also had an adverse effect on many casual dining restaurants such as our tenants friendly ice cream corporation and buffets holdings inc both of these tenants filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and the impact of bankruptcy filings by these or other tenants in the casual dining industry could as described in the immediately preceding sentence adversely affect us individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 nevertheless downturns in these other industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common and preferred stock in addition we may in the future make additional investments in the “convenience stores” industry which would increase this industry’s percentage of our rental revenues thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in this industry would have on us 

in addition a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket retail and other commercial enterprises that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail and other commercial enterprises and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional national or international economy 

furthermore we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant netlease retail locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states and properties leased to tenants engaged in nonretail businesses for example our acquisitions in 2011 included distribution properties office properties and manufacturing properties leased to tenants in a range of nonretail businesses these risks may include a limited knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the tenant operates limited experience in managing certain types of new properties new types of real estate locations and lease structures and the laws and culture of any nonus jurisdiction 

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

 

 

 

 

there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by us in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

it is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result should our tenants or their employees or customers be exposed to mold at any of our properties we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property which would reduce our cash available for distribution in addition exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise 

compliance we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

insurance and indemnity in june 2005 we entered into a sevenyear environmental insurance policy or the june 2005 policy which expires on june 1 2012 on our property portfolio which replaced the previous fiveyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 40000 self insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties 

additionally in december 2009 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in december 2019 that will initially act in an excess capacity to our june 2005 policy on june 1 2012 this policy will become our primary environmental policy with the same limits as the june 2005 policy except that once we pay a total of 1 million for self insurance retention there will be a 50000 per loss maintenance fee rather than the 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for general environmental claims 

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

 

  

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

 

 

 

 

 

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax our subsidiary crest is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property 

distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains each year 

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 425 million acquisition credit facility at december 31 2011 we had 2374 million of outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility a total of 175 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities and 678 million of outstanding mortgage debt as a result of the issuance of our class f preferred stock in february 2012 we paid off all outstanding credit facility borrowings on february 7 2012 to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our acquisition credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing financial crisis in europe which relates primarily to concerns that certain european countries may be unable to repay their national debt we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our acquisition credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

in addition our acquisition credit facility contains provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our acquisition credit facility provides that if an event of default as defined in the credit facility exists neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make any distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

 

 

 

except that we may repurchase or redeem preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock the acquisition credit facility further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to any of our subsidiaries that has guaranteed amounts payable under the credit facility or that meets a significance test set forth in the credit facility we and our subsidiaries may not pay any distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default under our acquisition credit facility were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or prevent us from paying those distributions altogether and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit 

  

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

if we default under a mortgage loan we will automatically be in default of any other loan that has crossdefault provisions and we may lose the properties securing these loans 

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition over the last several years prices of common stock in the us trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market price of our common stock has also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between 1000000 and 10000000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders given the recent disruptions in the insurance industry we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the netlease industry 

terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or us businesses these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants 

if events like these were to occur they could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last several years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably in addition the ongoing financial crisis in europe which relates primarily to concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar effect these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing unrest in certain middle eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants ability to pay rent 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values which are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability which can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the sec is currently considering whether issuers in the us should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards or ifrs instead of us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap ifrs is a comprehensive set of accounting standards promulgated by the international accounting standards board or iasb which are rapidly gaining worldwide acceptance if the sec decides to require ifrs it expects that us issuers would first report under the new standards beginning in approximately 2015 or 2016 although the timeframe has not been finalized additionally the financial accounting standards board or fasb is considering various changes to gaap some of which may be significant as part of a joint effort with the iasb to converge accounting standards although the fasb and iasb currently have a project on their agenda to examine the accounting for leases the project may not result in the issuance of a final standard or a standard that would be comparable to current gaap if ifrs is adopted the potential issues associated with lease accounting along with other potential changes associated with the adoption or convergence with ifrs may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust or reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to retail and other commercial enterprises we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal credit research real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 43 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail and other properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements primarily 10 to 20 years 

in addition we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 

at december 31 2011 we owned a diversified portfolio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the 2634 properties in the portfolio 2619 or 994 are singletenant properties and the remaining 15 are multitenant properties at december 31 2011 of the 2619 singletenant properties 2533 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 113 years 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

our primary cash obligations for the current year and subsequent years are included in the “table of obligations” which is presented later in this section we expect to fund our operating expenses and other shortterm liquidity requirements including property acquisitions and development costs payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness property improvements releasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders primarily through cash provided by operating activities borrowing on our 425 million credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings 

 

conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2011 our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were 206 billion or approximately 291 of our total market capitalization of 706 billion 

  

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2011 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mortgage debt 

as of december 31 2011 we have 672 million of mortgages payable to thirdparty lenders that were assumed in 2011 in connection with our property acquisitions we paid 279000 in principal payments on these mortgages payable during 2011 additionally net premiums totaling 820000 in aggregate were recorded upon assumption of the mortgages payable at the time of the respective property acquisitions to account for abovemarket interest rates we recorded amortization of 189000 related to these net premiums during 2011 

our mortgages payable are secured by the properties on which the debt was placed and are nonrecourse we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties and costs make it economically feasible to do so we intend to continue our policy of primarily identifying property acquisitions that are free from mortgage indebtedness 

425 million acquisition credit facility 

we have a 425 million unsecured revolving credit facility the initial term of the credit facility expires in march 2014 and includes two oneyear extension options under the credit facility the current investment grade credit ratings on our debt securities provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 220 basis points over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling we also have other interest rate options available to us under the credit facility at december 31 2011 we had a borrowing capacity of 1876 million available on our credit facility subject to customary conditions to borrowing and an outstanding balance of 2374 million as a result of the issuance of our class f preferred stock in february 2012 we paid off all outstanding credit facility borrowings on february 7 2012 the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december 31 2011 was 21 per annum we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility at december 31 2011 we remain in compliance with these covenants 

we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 200 million to a total borrowing capacity of 625 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 42 million 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

  

  

acquisitions during 2011 

during 2011 we invested 102 billion in 164 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 78 the majority of the lease revenue from these properties will be generated from tenants that have investment grade ratings on their senior debt securities these 164 new properties and properties under development are located in 26 states contain over 62 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 134 years 

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent or in the case of a property under development the estimated base rent for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total cost of the properties since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

included in the 102 billion invested during 2011 are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portfolio discussion 

leasing results 

at december 31 2011 we had 87 properties available for lease out of 2634 properties in our portfolio which represents a 967 occupancy rate since december 31 2010 when we reported 84 properties available for lease and a 966 occupancy rate we 

 

 

 

during 2011 89 properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants the rent on these leases was 96 million as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of 104 million at december 31 2011 our average annualized rental revenue per square foot was approximately 1706 

investments in existing properties 

in 2011 we capitalized costs of 42 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 17 million for releasing costs and 25 million for building and tenant improvements in 2010 we capitalized costs of 36 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 15 million for releasing costs and 21 million for building improvements 

as part of our releasing costs we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

  

the majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs hvac improvements and parking lot resurfacing and replacements it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly depending on the rental market credit worthiness and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which may impact our access to and cost of capital we continue to monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly see our discussion of risk factors in this annual report 

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

we continue our 43year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per common share increased 00003125 in april 2011 to 01445625 in july 2011 to 0144875 in october 2011 to 01451875 and in january 2012 to 01455 the increase in january 2012 was our 57 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 64 th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2011 we paid three monthly cash distributions per common share in the amount of 014425 three in the amount of 01445625 three in the amount of 0144875 and three in the amount of 01451875 totaling 1736625 in december 2011 january 2012 and february 2012 we declared distributions of 01455 per share which were paid in january 2012 and will be paid in february 2012 and march 2012 respectively 

the current monthly distribution of 01455 per share represents an annualized distribution of 1746 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 50 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 3496 on december 31 2011 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock

matters pertaining to certain tenants 

in january 2012 friendly ice cream corporation or friendly’s one of our tenants announced that it was emerging from voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code which they had filed for in october 2011 pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings friendly’s accepted 102 of their 121 leases with us friendly’s rejected 19 leases with us representing approximately 18 million of annualized rent and received rent concessions and term reductions on some of their accepted leases with us overall postbankruptcy we estimate that we will recover approximately 80 of the 161 million of annualized rent that friendly’s was paying the company before the bankruptcy filing 

additionally in january 2012 buffets holding inc or buffets another one of our tenants filed for voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code buffets leases 86 properties from us that as of december 31 2011 represented approximately 182 million or approximately 39 of our annualized rental revenue buffets rejected the leases on seven of our 86 properties representing approximately 18 million of annualized rent additionally we have reached a preliminary agreement subject to bankruptcy court approval with buffets regarding rent concessions and term reductions on some of buffets’ other leases with us overall postbankruptcy we estimate that we will recover approximately 65 of the 182 million of annualized rent that buffets was paying us before the bankruptcy filing friendly’s and buffets both operate casual dining restaurants 

 

for both friendly’s and buffets any properties returned to us are immediately available for release to other tenants we believe that demand in the market for the rejected properties will allow us to find suitable replacement tenants within the next 18 months however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding replacement tenants for these properties within this timeframe or at all or that friendly’s or buffets will continue to pay rent for the remainder of the lease terms on their accepted leases 

in addition we have recently concluded an analysis of our portfolio and have identified other tenants whose leases represented approximately 2 to 3 of our total annualized rent as of december 31 2011 that we believe may make similar bankruptcy filings in 2012 however the foregoing percentages are estimates and are subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties and the actual percentage of annualized rent represented by other tenants who make bankruptcy filings during 2012 may be different 

results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight–line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 

when acquiring a property for investment purposes we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to 1 land and 2 building and improvements based in each case on their estimated fair values in addition any assumed mortgages payable are recorded at their estimated fair values 

  

  

for properties acquired with inplace operating leases we allocate the fair value of real estate to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket and belowmarket leases the value of inplace leases and tenant relationships as applicable 

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates estimated holding periods capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet our strategy of primarily holding properties longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable thus requiring the recognition of an impairment however if our strategy or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future an impairment may need to be recognized if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

rental revenue 

rental revenue was 4194 million for 2011 versus 3428 million for 2010 an increase of 766 million or 223 rental revenue was 3217 million in 2009 the increase in rental revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool we include all properties that were owned for the entire yeartodate period for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that i were available for lease at any time ii were under development iii we have made an additional investment iv were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced and v were released with rentfree periods each of the exclusions from the same store pool is separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period 

of the 2634 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2011 2619 or 994 are singletenant properties and the remaining 15 are multitenant properties of the 2619 singletenant properties 2533 or 967 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 113 years at december 31 2011 of our 2533 leased singletenant properties 2341 or 924 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 14 million in 2011 13 million in 2010 and 13 million in 2009 excluding percentage rent reclassified to discontinued operations of 17000 in 2011 55000 in 2010 and 112000 in 2009 percentage rent in 2011 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2012 

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to regional and national commercial enterprises under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2011 our portfolio of 2634 properties was 967 leased with 87 properties available for lease as compared to 84 at december 31 2010 it has been our experience that approximately 2 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 1218 million in 2011 versus 949 million in 2010 and 899 million in 2009 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2011 and 2010 which was partially offset by property sales in those same years as discussed in the section entitled funds from operations available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo 

interest expense 

interest expense was 1083 million in 2011 versus 932 million in 2010 and 855 million in 2009 the increase in interest expense from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in borrowings attributable to the issuance of our 250 million of 575 senior unsecured notes in june 2010 the 150 million reopening of our 5875 senior unsecured bonds due 2035 in june 2011 and higher credit facility commitment fees and origination costs as a result of our 425 million acquisition credit facility which was entered into in december 2010 

as a result of entering into our current credit facility we incurred credit facility origination costs of 42 million that were classified as part of other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 the balance of these credit facility origination costs was 31 million which is being amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

 

 

at december 31 2011 the weighted average interest rate on our 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures our ebitda and adjusted ebitda computation may not be comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda reported by other companies that interpret the definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do management believes ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be meaningful measures of a reits performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts lenders and investors and is used by management as one measure of performance in addition management utilizes adjusted ebitda because our 425 million credit facility uses a similar metric to measure our compliance with certain covenants ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be considered along with but not an alternative to net income cash flow and ffo as measures of our operating performance 

the following is a reconciliation of net income our most directly comparable gaap measure to adjusted ebitda dollars in thousands 

 

interest coverage ratio 

interest coverage ratio is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by interest expense including interest recorded as discontinued operations we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

 

 

 

 

fixed charge coverage ratio 

fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures or information presented in exhibit 121 to this annual report 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased by 57 million to 310 million in 2011 as compared to 253 million in 2010 general and administrative expenses were 209 million in 2009 included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs of 15 million for 2011 368000 for 2010 and 62000 for 2009 general and administrative expenses increased during 2011 primarily due to increases in employee costs and higher acquisition transaction costs general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 74 in 2011 as compared to 74 in 2010 and 65 in 2009 in february 2012 we had 83 employees as compared to 79 employees in february 2011 and 72 employees in february 2010 

property expenses 

property expenses consist of costs associated with unleased properties nonnet leased multitenant properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to unleased properties and multitenant properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2011 87 properties were available for lease as compared to 84 at december 31 2010 and 75 at december 31 2009 

property expenses were 74 million in 2011 71 million in 2010 and 64 million in 2009 the increase in property expenses in 2011 is primarily attributable to an increase in insurance costs and legal fees associated with properties available for lease partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense 

income taxes 

income taxes were 15 million in 2011 as compared to 14 million in 2010 and 677000 in 2009 these amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income income taxes for 2009 were lower primarily a result of a prior year review of our state tax filings where we determined that it was appropriate to amend some prior year tax returns from which we realized a tax benefit of 308000 in 2009 

discontinued operations 

operations from five investment properties classified as held for sale at december 31 2011 plus properties previously sold have been classified as discontinued operations the following is a summary of income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands 

 

the above per share amounts have each been calculated independently 

crest’s assets and property sales 

at december 31 2011 our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiary crest net lease inc or crest had an inventory of three properties which are classified as held for investment in addition to the three properties crest also holds notes receivable of 190 million at december 31 2011 during 2011 the principal balance of one note receivable was paid in full from which we received proceeds of approximately 29 million 

  

during 2011 and 2010 crest did not sell any properties during 2009 crest sold two properties for 20 million which resulted in no gain crest’s gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are included in discontinued operations 

 

  

  

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

during 2011 we sold 26 investment properties for 218 million which resulted in a gain of 52 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations additionally we sold excess real estate from six properties for 23 million which resulted in a gain of 540000 this gain is included in other revenue on our consolidated statement of income for 2011 because this excess real estate was associated with properties that continue to be owned as part of our core operations 

during 2010 we sold 28 investment properties and excess land from one property for 272 million which resulted in a gain of 87 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations 

during 2009 we sold 25 investment properties and excess land from one property for 205 million which resulted in a gain of 81 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations 

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2011 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 22 million as held for sale on our balance sheet in 2012 we intend to employ more active disposition efforts to further enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio as a result we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 25 million and 60 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties 

provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest 

during 2011 crest did not record any provisions for impairment 

during 2010 crest recorded total provisions for impairment of 807000 on three properties held for investment at december 31 2010 these provisions for impairment are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for 2010 

during 2009 crest recorded total provisions for impairment of 199000 on three properties classified as held for investment at december 31 2010 these provisions for impairment are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for 2009 additionally in 2009 crest recorded total provisions for impairment of 78000 on two properties which were sold in 2009 these provisions for impairment are included in income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income for 2009 

provisions for impairment on realty income investment properties 

during 2011 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 405000 on two properties in the automotive service industry one property in the motor vehicle dealerships industry and one property in the pet supplies and services industry these provisions for impairment are included in income from discontinued operations except for 10000 which is included in income from continuing operations 

during 2010 realty income recorded total provisions for impairment of 213000 on three properties in the restaurant industry and one property in the child care industry provisions for impairment of 171000 are included in income from discontinued operations since one of these properties was subsequently reclassified from held for sale to held for investment during 2011 a provision for impairment of 42000 is included in income from continuing operations 

  

  

during 2009 we recorded a provision for impairment of 110000 on one property in the convenience store industry which was sold during 2010 this provision for impairment is included in income from discontinued operations 

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock cash dividends totaled 243 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1328 million in 2011 an increase of 263 million as compared to 1065 million in 2010 net income available to common stockholders in 2009 was 1069 million 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties and excess land the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

gain from the sale of investment properties and the sale of excess real estate recognized during 2011 was 57 million as compared to an 87 million gain recognized during 2010 and an 81 million gain recognized during 2009 

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

ffo for 2011 increased by 555 million or 286 to 2494 million as compared to 1939 million in 2010 and 1906 million in 2009 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets plus impairments of real estate assets reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items 

 

  

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance in addition ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

affo for 2011 increased by 561 million or 284 to 2534 million as compared to 1973 million in 2010 and 1927 million in 2009 we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term cad for cash available for distribution or fad for funds available for distribution 

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

we believe the nongaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies in particular affo provides an additional measure by which to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to the measurement of the particular company’s ongoing operating performance therefore we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 

presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance ffo and affo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

impact of inflation 

 

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

of our 2634 properties in our portfolio approximately 962 or 2533 are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

 

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

  

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2011 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

 

expected maturity data 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2011 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

all of our outstanding senior notes and bonds have fixed interest rates all of our mortgages payable except one have fixed interest rates interest on our credit facility balance is variable based on our credit facility balance of 2374 million at december 31 2011 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 24 milliion per year as a result of the issuance of our class f preferred stock in february 2012 we paid off all outstanding credit facility borrowings on february 7 2012 

  

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

 

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

 

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

 

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled internal controlintegrated framework published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting

changes in internal controls 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2011 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

the current monthly distribution of 014425 per share represents an annualized distribution of 1731 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 51 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 3420 on december 31 2010 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

  

acquisitions during 2010 

during 2010 we invested 7135 million in 186 new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 79 these 186 properties are located in 14 states contain over 22 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 157 years the 186 new properties we acquired are netleased to commercial enterprises in the following 13 industries apparel stores automotive collision services automotive service crafts and novelties consumer electronics convenience store drug stores grocery stores health and fitness office supplies restaurants sporting goods and wine and spirits there were no acquisitions by crest in 2010 

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total cost of the properties since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

included in the 7135 million invested during 2010 are the following acquisitions 

 

 

 

 

 

investments in existing properties 

in 2010 we capitalized costs of 36 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 15 million for releasing costs and 21 million for building improvements 

425 million acquisition credit facility 

in december 2010 we entered into a new 425 million acquisition credit facility that replaced our previous 355 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in may 2011 the initial term of the new credit facility expires in march 2014 and includes two oneyear extension options under the new credit facility our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 220 basis points over libor we also have other interest rate options available to us our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation at december 31 2010 there were no borrowings on our credit facility but if there were the effective borrowing rate would have been 21 

issuance of common stock 

in december 2010 we issued 7360000 shares of common stock at a price of 3370 per share the net proceeds of approximately 2357 million were used to repay borrowings of 1798 million under our acquisition credit facility and to fund property acquisitions during december 2010 the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and working capital 

  

in september 2010 we issued 6198500 shares of common stock at a price of 3340 per share the net proceeds of approximately 1969 million were used to repay borrowings of 497 million under our acquisition credit facility and to fund 1265 million of property acquisitions during october 2010 the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and working capital 

note issuance 

in june 2010 we issued 2500 million aggregate principal amount of 575 senior unsecured notes due january 2021 or the 2021 notes the price to the investor for the 2021 notes was 99404 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5826 the net proceeds of approximately 2461 million from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility which were used to finance the acquisition of the diageo properties interest is paid semiannually on the 2021 notes 

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1065 million in 2010 versus 1069 million in 2009 a decrease of 343000 on a diluted per common share basis net income was 101 in 2010 as compared to 103 in 2009 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

the gain from the sale of properties during 2010 was 87 million as compared to 81 million during 2009 

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

in 2010 our ffo increased by 33 million or 17 to 1937 million versus 1904 million in 2009 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 183 in 2010 compared to 184 in 2009 a decrease of 001 or 05 

see our discussion of ffo in the section entitled management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo 

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

in 2010 our affo increased by 46 million or 24 to 1973 million versus 1927 million in 2009 on a diluted per common share basis affo was 186 in 2010 and 2009 

see our discussion of affo in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and affo 

 

distribution policy 

distributions are paid monthly to our common class d preferred and class e preferred stockholders if and when declared by our board of directors 

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains in 2010 our cash distributions totaled 2068 million or approximately 1363 of our estimated reit taxable income of 1517 million our estimated reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated reit taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit distribution requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or performance 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our 2010 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 1825 million representing 942 of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of 1937 million 

the class d preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 184375 per annum per share the class e preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 675 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 16875 per annum per share dividends on our class d and class e preferred stock are current 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute qualified dividend income subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for qualified dividend income has generally been reduced to 15 until it “sunsets” or reverts to the provisions of prior law which under current law will occur with respect to taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends except to the extent the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year or as discussed above dividends properly designated by us as capital gain dividends distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders basis in their stock distributions above that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 268 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2010 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital 

 

business philosophy and strategy 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2010 our total outstanding borrowings were 16 billion of senior unsecured notes or approximately 267 of our total market capitalization of 599 billion there were no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility at december 31 2010 

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2010 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

investment philosophy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of commercial properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants gross sales above a specified level or fixed increases we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm leases coupled with the tenants responsibility for property expenses generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

investment strategy 

when identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is generally on providing capital to owners and operators of retail and other commercial enterprises by acquiring then leasing back the real estate they consider important to the successful operation of their business we categorize tenants as 1 venture market 2 middle market and 3 upper market venture companies typically offer a newer concept generally in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and 50 locations middle market companies typically have 50 to 500 locations operations in more than one geographic region have been successful through one or more economic cycles and have a proven replicable concept the upper market tenants typically consist of companies with 500 or more locations operating a proven mature concept upper market tenants generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital 

we primarily focus on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail and other commercial enterprises that we believe are attractive for investment because 

 

 

 

 

 

historically our investment focus has primarily been on retail and other commercial enterprises that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2010 approximately 78 of our rental revenue was derived from tenants with a service component in their business we believe these serviceoriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internetbased businesses 

credit strategy 

we primarily provide saleleaseback financing to less than investment grade tenants we typically acquire and lease back properties to regional and national commercial enterprises and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return since 1970 our overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 982 and our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 

  

  

we believe the principal financial obligations of most commercial enterprises typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business we believe the risk of default on a tenants’ lease obligations is less than the tenants unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

 

 

 

 

the typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more locations generally the properties 

 

 

 

acquisition strategy 

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national retailers and other commercial enterprises are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale strong consumer brands advertising and the selection of prime locations we execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national commercial enterprises by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting real estate for potential investment we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which sometimes impact our access to and cost of capital we continue to monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly see item 1a entitled risk factors in this annual report 

  

portfolio management strategy 

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing our credit quality 

our executives regularly review and analyze 

 

 

 

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2010 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 36 million as held for sale on our balance sheet additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties 

universal shelf registration 

in march 2009 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which expires in march 2012 in accordance with the sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock preferred stock debt securities or any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

425 million acquisition credit facility 

in december 2010 we entered into a new 425 million revolving unsecured credit facility that replaced our previous 355 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in may 2011 the initial term of the new credit facility expires in march 2014 and includes two oneyear extension options under the new credit facility our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at libor plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 220 basis points over libor we also have other interest rate options available to us our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation at december 31 2010 we had a borrowing capacity of 425 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding balance if there were outstanding borrowings the effective borrowing rate would have been 21 

we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 200 million to a total borrowing capacity of 625 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the banks participating in our credit facility 

  

  

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter when capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings we are currently assigned the following investment grade credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes all of these ratings have stable outlooks 

based on our current ratings the current facility interest rate is libor plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 220 basis points over libor the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 300 basis points if our credit facility is lower than bbbbaa3 and ii libor plus 175 basis points if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which ranges from i 50 basis points for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 and ii 30 basis points for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

mortgage debt 

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in variable interest entities or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments additionally we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as such our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of offbalance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

competitive strategy 

we believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  




 item 1a   risk factors 

this risk factors section contains references to our capital stock and to our stockholders unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our capital stock represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our stockholders represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock 

in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

 

 

 

 

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenants lease and material losses to us 

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

  

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenants lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations any of these events could adversely affect cash from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness 

eightyfour of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2010 of which all but one were singletenant properties at december 31 2010 32 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2010 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

for the fourth quarter of 2010 our tenants in the restaurant and convenience store industries accounted for approximately 191 and 174 respectively of our rental revenue a downturn in either of these industries whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect tenants in these industries which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010 nevertheless downturns in these other industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common and preferred stock in addition we may in the future make additional investments in the restaurant industry and convenience store industry which would increase these industries’ percentages of our rental revenues thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in these industries would have on us 

in addition a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket retail and other commercial enterprises that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail and other commercial enterprises and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional or national economy 

furthermore we may make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding singletenant netlease retail locations in the united states we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types andor new jurisdictions outside the united states these risks may include a limited knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the tenant operates new types of real estate locations and lease structures and new laws and culture of any nonus jurisdiction 

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

 

 

 

 

there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

  

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by us in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

it is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result should our tenants or their employees or customers be exposed to mold at any of our properties we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property which would reduce our cash available for distribution in addition exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise 

compliance we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

insurance and indemnity in june 2005 we entered into a sevenyear environmental insurance policy or the june 2005 policy which expires on june 1 2012 on our property portfolio which replaced the previous fiveyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 40000 self insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties 

additionally in december 2009 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in december 2019 that will initially act in an excess capacity to our june 2005 policy on june 1 2012 this policy will become our primary environmental policy with the same limits as the june 2005 policy except that once we pay a total of 1 million for self insurance retention there will be a 50000 per loss maintenance fee rather than the 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for general environmental claims 

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

  

  

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

 

 

 

 

 

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax our subsidiary crest is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property 

distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains each year 

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 425 million acquisition credit facility at december 31 2010 we had no borrowings outstanding under our 425 million acquisition credit facility and we had a total of 16 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our 425 million credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given the recent disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing financial crisis in europe which relates primarily to concerns that certain european countries may be unable to repay their national debt we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

in addition our 425 million credit facility contains provisions that could limit or in certain cases prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our 425 million acquisition credit facility provides that if an event of default as defined in the credit facility exists neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make any distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of 

 

 

 

except that we may repurchase or redeem preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock the 425 million credit facility further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to any of our subsidiaries that has guaranteed amounts payable under the credit facility or that meets a significance test set forth in the credit facility we and our subsidiaries may not pay any distributions on except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class or repurchase or redeem among other things any shares of our common stock or preferred stock if any such event of default were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or prevent us from qualifying as a reit 

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition over the last three years prices of common stock in the us trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market price of our common stock has also fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between 1000000 and 10000000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders given the recent disruptions in the insurance industry we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the netlease industry 

terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or us businesses these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants 

if events like these were to occur they could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last three years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably more recently the financial crisis in europe which relates primarily to concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar although less pronounced effect these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock preferred stock and debt securities the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants ability to pay rent 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values which are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability which can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates 

 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

the sec is currently considering whether issuers in the us should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards or ifrs instead of us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap ifrs is a comprehensive set of accounting standards promulgated by the international accounting standards board or iasb which are rapidly gaining worldwide acceptance the sec has indicated that it will decide in 2011 whether ifrs will be required for us issuers if the sec decides to require ifrs it expects that us issuers would first report under the new standards beginning in approximately 2015 or 2016 although the timeframe has not been finalized additionally the financial accounting standards board or fasb is considering various changes to gaap some of which may be significant as part of a joint effort with the iasb to converge accounting standards although the fasb and iasb currently have a project on their agenda to examine the accounting for leases the project may not result in the issuance of a final standard or a standard that would be comparable to current gaap if ifrs is adopted the potential issues associated with lease accounting along with other potential changes associated with the adoption or convergence with ifrs may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust or reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to retail and other commercial enterprises we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal credit research real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 42 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail and other commercial properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements primarily 15 to 20 years 

in addition we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 

at december 31 2010 we owned a diversified portfolio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the 2496 properties in the portfolio 2485 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining 11 are multitenant distribution and office properties at december 31 2010 of the 2485 singletenant properties 2402 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately 114 years 

in addition at december 31 2010 our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiary crest net lease inc crest had an inventory of three properties valued at 30 million which are classified as held for investment no crest properties are classified as held for sale at december 31 2010 crest was created to buy and sell properties primarily to individual investors who are involved in taxdeferred exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” in addition to the three properties crest also holds notes receivable of 221 million at december 31 2010 crest did not acquire any properties in 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs by issuing common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be invested on an accretive basis into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2010 our total outstanding borrowings were 16 billion of senior unsecured notes or approximately 267 of our total market capitalization of 599 billion there were no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility at december 31 2010 

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2010 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

mortgage debt 

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

425 million acquisition credit facility 

in december 2010 we entered into a new 425 million acquisition credit facility that replaced our previous 355 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in may 2011 the initial term of the new credit facility expires in march 2014 and includes two oneyear extension options under the new credit facility our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 220 basis points over libor the borrowing rate is not subject to a libor floor we also have other interest rate options available to us at december 31 2010 we had a borrowing capacity of 425 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding balance if there were outstanding borrowings the effective borrowing rate would have been 21 

we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 200 million to a total borrowing capacity of 625 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 176 million 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

acquisitions during 2010 

during 2010 we invested 7135 million in 186 new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 79 these 186 properties are located in 14 states contain over 22 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 157 years the 186 new properties we acquired are netleased to commercial enterprises in the following 13 industries apparel stores automotive collision services automotive service crafts and novelties consumer electronics convenience stores drug stores grocery stores health and fitness office supplies restaurants sporting goods and wine and spirits there were no acquisitions by crest in 2010 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total cost of the properties since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

included in the 7135 million invested during 2010 are the following acquisitions 

 

 

 

 

 

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial real estate market property prices generally continue to fluctuate likewise the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which sometimes impact our access to and cost of capital we continue to monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly see our discussion of risk factors in this annual report 

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

we have continued our 42year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share increased in april 2010 by 00003125 to 01433125 in july 2010 by 00003125 to 0143625 in october 2010 by 00003125 to 01439375 and in january 2011 by 00003125 to 014425 the increase in january 2011 was our 53 rd consecutive quarterly increase and the 60 th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the new york stock exchange or nyse in 1994 in 2010 we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of 0143 three in the amount of 01433125 three in the amount of 0143625 and three in the amount of 01439375 totaling 1721625 in december 2010 january 2011 and february 2011 we declared distributions of 014425 per share which were paid in january 2011 and will be paid in february 2011 and march 2011 respectively 

the monthly distribution of 014425 per share represents an annualized distribution of 1731 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 51 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 3420 on december 31 2010 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period

in december 2010 we issued 7360000 shares of common stock at a price of 3370 per share the net proceeds of approximately 2357 million were used to repay borrowings of 1798 million under our acquisition credit facility and to fund property acquisitions during december 2010 the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and working capital

credit agency ratings 

the borrowing rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings we are currently assigned the following investment grade credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes all of these ratings have stable outlooks 

based on our current ratings the current facility interest rate is libor plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 220 basis points over libor the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus 300 basis points if our credit facility is lower than bbbbaa3 and ii libor plus 175 basis points if our credit rating is aa3 or higher in addition our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings which ranges from i 50 basis points for a rating lower than bbbbaa3 and ii 30 basis points for a credit rating of aa3 or higher 

we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

notes outstanding

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually all of these notes and bonds contain various covenants including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60 ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40 iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 15 times and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150 of our outstanding unsecured debt we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes and bonds was issued

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2010 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

our credit facility and note obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

 

  

  

preferred stock outstanding 

in 2004 we issued 51 million shares of 7375 class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock in may 2009 shares of class d preferred stock became redeemable at our option for 25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class d preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 

in 2006 we issued 88 million shares of 675 class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock beginning december 7 2011 shares of class e preferred stock become redeemable at our option for 25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class e preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in variable interest entities or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments additionally we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as such our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of offbalance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

 

results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight–line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 

when acquiring a property for investment purposes we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to 1 land and 2 building and improvements based in each case on their estimated fair values 

for properties acquired with inplace operating leases the fair value of real estate is allocated to 1 land 2 building and improvements and 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their estimated fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket and belowmarket leases the value of inplace leases and tenant relationships 

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

  

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

rental revenue 

rental revenue was 3441 million for 2010 versus 3238 million for 2009 an increase of 203 million or 63 rental revenue was 3232 million in 2008 the increase in rental revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily attributable to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the 2496 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2010 2485 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining 11 are multitenant distribution and office properties of the 2485 singletenant properties 2402 or 967 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 114 years at december 31 2010 of our 2402 leased singletenant properties 2217 or 923 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 13 million in 2010 13 million in 2009 and 12 million in 2008 excluding percentage rent reclassified to discontinued operations of 56000 in 2010 90000 in 2009 and 61000 in 2008 percentage rent in 2010 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2011 

our portfolio of real estate leased primarily to regional and national commercial enterprises under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2010 our portfolio of 2496 properties was 966 leased with 84 properties available for lease as compared to 75 at december 31 2009 it has been our experience that approximately 2 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels

depreciation and amortization was 955 million in 2010 versus 905 million in 2009 and 891 million in 2008 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2010 2009 and 2008 which was partially offset by property sales in those same years as discussed in the section entitled funds from operations available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo 

  

interest expense 

interest expense was 932 million in 2010 versus 855 million in 2009 and 940 million in 2008 the increase in interest expense from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in borrowings attributable to the issuance of our 250 million of 575 senior unsecured notes in june 2010 and utilization of our credit facility in 2010 which was partially offset by lower average interest rates the decrease in interest expense from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances and to a lesser extent lower interest rates we redeemed in november 2008 the 100 million outstanding principal amount of our 825 monthly income senior notes and in january 2009 the 20 million outstanding principal amount of our 8 notes both of which contributed to the decrease in average outstanding balances and lower average interest rates on our debt in 2009 

in december 2010 as a result of entering into our 425 million credit facility we incurred 42 million of credit facility origination costs that were classified in “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 and are being amortized over the term of the credit facility the remaining credit facility origination costs that were incurred as a result of entering into our previous 355 million credit facility which were 452000 at december 31 2010 are included in “other assets” and are being amortized over the remaining term of our current 425 million credit facility 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

 

 

at december 31 2010 the weighted average interest rate on our notes payable of 16 billion was 605 there was no outstanding balance on our credit facility at december 31 2010 but if there was the effective borrowing rate would have been 211 

interest coverage ratio 

our interest coverage ratio for 2010 was 33 times for 2009 was 35 times and for 2008 was 32 times interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated in the following table divided by interest expense including interest recorded as discontinued operations we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flow to our interest coverage amount dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

fixed charge coverage ratio 

our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2010 was 27 times for 2009 was 27 times and for 2008 was 26 times fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures or information presented in exhibit 121 to this annual report

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased by 44 million to 253 million in 2010 as compared to 209 million in 2009 general and administrative expenses were 216 million in 2008 in 2010 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 73 as compared to 64 in 2009 and 67 in 2008 general and administrative expenses increased during 2010 primarily because of increases in employee costs particularly in the acquisitions and research departments in february 2011 we had 79 employees as compared to 72 employees in february 2010 in accordance with gaap 2010 general and administrative expenses also include transaction costs of 368000 related to the acquisition of 186 new properties during 2010 as compared to 62000 related to the acquisition of 16 new properties during 2009 prior to 2009 gaap required these transaction costs to be capitalized as part of the property investments 

  

  

property expenses 

property expenses are broken down into costs associated with nonnet leased multitenant properties unleased singletenant properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to the multitenant and unleased singletenant properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal bad debt expense property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2010 84 properties were available for lease as compared to 75 at december 31 2009 and 70 at december 31 2008 

property expenses were 73 million in 2010 66 million in 2009 and 55 million in 2008 the increase in property expenses in 2010 is primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance utilities and property taxes associated with properties available for lease partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense 

income taxes 

income taxes were 14 million in 2010 as compared to 677000 in 2009 and 12 million in 2008 these amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income income taxes for 2009 are lower primarily a result of a prior year review of our state tax filings where we determined that it was appropriate to amend some prior year tax returns from which we realized a tax benefit of 308000 in 2009 

in addition crest recorded state and federal income tax benefits of 344000 in 2010 as compared to income tax benefits of 645000 in 2009 and income tax expense of 225000 in 2008 these amounts are included in income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income the crest 2009 tax benefit includes a benefit of 303000 attributable to amendments of certain prior year state tax returns 

discontinued operations 

crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties consequently we typically crests assets as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them as a result the operations of crest’s property assets are typically classified as income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income 

 

however if we determine we have no plans to sell a property asset in the near term ie within the next 12 months and this property was previously classified as held for sale the property is reclassified as real estate held for investment a property that is reclassified as held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of i its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment or ii the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 

 

at december 31 2010 we determined that three property assets acquired by crest in 2006 no longer met the held for sale criteria because we decided to lease rather than sell these properties in the near term as a result investment in real estate of 30 million was reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate held for investment on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 the results of operations for these properties are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income as a result of this reclassification 911000 214000 and 32 million in operating loss was reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

the following is a summary of crest’s income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

 

1 depreciation was recorded on one property that was classified as held for investment this property was sold in 2008 

operations from nine of our investment properties were classified as held for sale at december 31 2010 plus properties sold in 2010 2009 and 2008 have been classified as discontinued operations the following is a summary of realty income’s income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

 

 the following is a summary of our total income from discontinued operations dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

the above per share amounts have each been calculated independently 

crest’s property sales 

during 2010 crest did not sell any properties during 2009 crest sold two properties for 20 million which resulted in no gain in 2008 crest sold 25 properties for 507 million which resulted in a gain of 46 million during 2008 as part of two sales crest provided buyer financing of 192 million crest’s gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are included in discontinued operations 

  

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

during 2010 we sold 28 investment properties for 266 million which resulted in a gain of 84 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations additionally we sold excess land from one property for 600000 which resulted in a gain of 271000 this gain is included in “other revenue” on our consolidated statement of income for 2010 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations 

during 2009 we sold 25 investment properties for 203 million which resulted in a gain of 80 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations additionally we received proceeds of 170000 from the sale of excess land from one property which resulted in a gain of 15000 this gain is included in other revenue on our consolidated statement of income for 2009 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations 

during 2008 we sold 29 investment properties for 274 million which resulted in a gain of 133 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations additionally we received proceeds of 439000 from the sale of excess land from one property which resulted in a gain of 236000 this gain is included in other revenue on our consolidated statement of income for 2008 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations 

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2010 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 36 million as held for sale on our balance sheet additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties 

provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest 

during 2010 crest recorded total provisions for impairment of 807000 on three properties held for investment at december 31 2010 these provisions for impairment are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for 2010 

during 2009 crest recorded total provisions for impairment of 199000 on three properties classified as held for investment at december 31 2010 these provisions for impairment are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for 2009 additionally in 2009 crest recorded total provisions for impairment of 78000 on two properties which were sold in 2009 these provisions for impairment are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” on our consolidated statement of income for 2009 

during 2008 crest recorded total provisions for impairment of 34 million on three properties which were held for investment at december 31 2010 these provisions for impairment are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for 2008 

  

provisions for impairment on realty income investment properties 

during 2010 we recorded provisions for impairment of 213000 on four properties three which were sold in 2010 and the other is anticipated to be sold in the first quarter of 2011 these provisions for impairment are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment” on our consolidated statement of income for 2010 during 2009 we recorded a provision for impairment of 110000 on one property which is included in income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment on our consolidated statement of income for 2009 and the property was sold in 2010 no provisions for impairment were recorded in 2008  

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock cash dividends totaled 243 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1065 million in 2010 a slight decrease of 343000 as compared to 1069 million in 2009 net income available to common stockholders in 2008 was 1076 million 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

gain from the sale of investment properties and the sale of excess land recognized during 2010 was 87 million as compared to a 81 million gain recognized during 2009 and a 136 million gain recognized during 2008 crest’s recognized no gain from the sale of properties during 2010 or 2009 as compared to 46 million during 2008 

  

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

ffo for 2010 increased by 33 million or 17 to 1937 million as compared to 1904 million in 2009 and 1855 million in 2008 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items 

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back noncash items such as depreciation the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance in addition ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

  

  

adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo 

affo for 2010 increased by 46 million or 24 to 1973 million as compared to 1927 million in 2009 and 1920 million in 2008 we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it provides analysts and investors with an additional indicator of our ability to pay dividends most companies in our industry use a similar measurement but they may use the term cad for cash available for distribution or fad for funds available for distribution affo further adjusts ffo by adding back noncash items that reduce net income in accordance with gaap and deducting such items as capitalized expenditures and straightline rent revenue 

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in addition ffo and affo should not be considered as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

  

  

  

impact of inflation 

 

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

of our 2496 properties in our portfolio approximately 962 or 2402 are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

 

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december 31 2010 we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable debt as of december 31 2010 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

 

expected maturity data 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2010 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on our credit facility balance is variable at december 31 2010 our credit facility balance was zero however we intend to borrow funds on our credit facility in the future based on a hypothetical credit facility borrowing of 50 million a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 500000 per year 

  

  

  




 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2010 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

 

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

 

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

changes in internal controls 

there have not been any significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2010 as of december 31 2010 there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

recent developments 

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

we have continued our 40year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share increased in january 2010 by 00003125 to 0143 the increase in january 2010 was our 49 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 56 th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2009 we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of 014175 three in the amount of 01420625 three in the amount of 0142375 and three in the amount of 01426875 totaling 1706625 in december 2009 and january 2010 we declared distributions of 0143 per share which were paid in january 2010 and will be paid in february 2010 respectively 

the monthly distribution of 0143 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1716 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 67 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2574 on february 8 2010 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

acquisitions during 2009 

during 2009 we invested 579 million in 16 new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 97 these 16 properties are located in five states contain over 278000 leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 179 years the 16 new properties we acquired are netleased to four different retail chains there were no acquisitions by crest in 2009 

we made fewer portfolio acquisitions in 2008 and 2009 than in previous years because we felt that preserving our capital resources and maintaining a high level of liquidity until property prices adjusted and the general economy improved was the prudent course of action in late 2009 we felt that market conditions had become more attractive for acquisitions and we currently believe that there are many retail chains with solid operating concepts that are in need of capital we believe that our solid financial position strong balance sheet and access to capital give us the ability to expand our acquisition activities in 2010 and invest in new retail properties that have the potential to contribute to our earnings 

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the aggregate base cash flow or in the case of properties under development the estimated aggregate base cash flow under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total cost of the properties since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

investments in existing properties 

in 2009 we capitalized costs of 31 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 12 million for releasing costs and 19 million for building improvements 

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1069 million in 2009 versus 1076 million in 2008 a decrease of 714000 on a diluted per common share basis net income was 103 per share in 2009 as compared to 106 per share in 2008 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

the gain from the sale of properties during 2009 was 81 million as compared to 136 million during 2008 

funds from operations ffo 

in 2009 our ffo increased by 49 million or 26 to 1904 million versus 1855 million in 2008 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 184 in 2009 compared to 183 in 2008 an increase of 001 or 05 

see our discussion of ffo in the section entitled management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo 

crest’s property sales 

during 2009 crest sold two properties from its inventory for an aggregate of 20 million which resulted in no gain 

crest’s property inventory 

crest’s had an inventory of three properties valued at 38 million at december 31 2009 which is included in real estate held for sale net on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 

note redemption 

upon their maturity in january 2009 we redeemed using cash on hand the 20 million outstanding principal amount of our 8 notes due 2009 or 2009 notes the 2009 notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest we have no debt maturities until march 2013 

retirement of board members 

william e clark our previous nonexecutive chairman retired from the board of directors in february 2009 mr clark had served as our chairman of the board since the inception of realty income our corporate governance and nominating committee recommended and the board of directors elected donald r cameron as our new nonexecutive chairman 

roger p kuppinger and willard h smith jr retired from the board of directors in may 2009 at which time ronald l merriman succeeded mr kuppinger as chairman of the audit committee 

distribution policy 

distributions are paid monthly to our common class d preferred and class e preferred stockholders if and when declared by our board of directors 

in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains in 2009 our cash distributions totaled 2023 million or approximately 1305 of our estimated reit taxable income of 1550 million our estimated reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated reit taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit distribution requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or performance 

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes furthermore we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders our 2009 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 1780 million representing 935 of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of 1904 million 

the class d preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 184375 per annum per share the class e preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 675 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 16875 per annum per share dividends on our class d and class e preferred stock are current 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute qualified dividend income subject to a reduced tax rate the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for qualified dividend income has generally been reduced to 15 until it “sunsets” or reverts to the provisions of prior law which under current law will occur with respect to taxable years beginning after december 31 2010 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends except to the extent the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year or as discussed above dividends properly designated by us as capital gain dividends distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders basis in their stock distributions above that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 241 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2009 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital 

business philosophy and strategy 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2009 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 1355 billion or approximately 308 of our total market capitalization of 440 billion 

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2009 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment philosophy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of retail properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings fixed increases or additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm leases coupled with the tenants responsibility for property expenses generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

investment strategy 

when identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is generally on providing capital to retail chain owners and operators by acquiring then leasing back retail store locations we categorize retail tenants as 1 venture market 2 middle market and 3 upper market venture companies typically offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and 50 retail locations middle market retail chains typically have 50 to 500 retail locations operations in more than one geographic region have been successful through one or more economic cycles and have a proven replicable concept the upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500 or more locations operating nationally in a proven mature retail concept upper market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital 

we primarily focus on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because 

 

 

 

 

 

historically our investment focus has primarily been on retail industries that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2009 approximately 843 of our rental revenue was derived from retailers with a service component in their business furthermore we believe these serviceoriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internet businesses 

credit strategy 

we generally provide saleleaseback financing to less than investment grade retail chains we typically acquire and lease back properties to regional and national retail chains and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers since 1970 our overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 983 and our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96 

we believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its retail business we believe the risk of default on a retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

 

 

 

 

the typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more retail locations generally the properties 

 

 

 

acquisition strategy 

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national retail chains are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale advertising and the selection of prime retail locations we execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain store owners and operators doing business in a variety of industries by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is fundamental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting real estate for potential investment we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial retail real estate market throughout 2008 and 2009 property prices generally continued to decline and lease rates rose likewise the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have impacted our access to and the cost of our capital we continue to monitor the commercial retail real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly see item 1a entitled risk factors in this annual report 

portfolio management strategy 

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality our executives review industry research tenant research property due diligence and significant portfolio management activities this monitoring typically includes regular review and analysis of 

 

 

 

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2009 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 83 million as held for sale on our balance sheet which includes three properties owned by crest valued at 38 million additionally we anticipate selling investment properties in our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties 

universal shelf registration 

in march 2009 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years to replace our prior shelf registration statement which was set to expire in april 2009 our new shelf registration statement expires in march 2012 in accordance with the sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock preferred stock debt securities or any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering 

355 million acquisition credit facility 

in may 2008 we entered into a 355 million revolving unsecured credit facility which replaced our previous 300 million acquisition credit facility the term of our credit facility is for three years until may 2011 plus two oneyear extension options under our credit facility our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 100 basis points with a facility fee of 275 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 1275 basis points over libor we also have other interest rate options available to us at december 31 2009 we had a borrowing capacity of 3504 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 46 million at an effective interest rate of 123 

we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 100 million to a total borrowing capacity of 455 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the banks participating in our credit facility 

we generally use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions thereafter when capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock or debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

credit agency ratings 

we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes all of these ratings have stable outlooks 

we have also been assigned credit ratings on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bb to our preferred stock all of these ratings have stable outlooks 

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

mortgage debt 

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in variable interest entities or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments additionally we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as such our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of offbalance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

competitive strategy 

we believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

this risk factors section contains references to our capital stock and to our stockholders unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our capital stock represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our stockholders represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock 

  

in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

 

 

 

 

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenants lease and material losses to us 

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenants lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

seventyfive of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2009 of which all but one were singletenant properties as of february 8 2010 transactions to lease or sell ten of the 75 properties were underway or completed at december 31 2009 36 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2009 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

for 2009 our tenants in the restaurant and convenience store industries accounted for approximately 213 and 170 respectively of our rental revenue a downturn in either of these industries whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect our tenants in these industries which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2009 nevertheless downturns in these other industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to make debt payments and distributions on our common and preferred stock 

in addition a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket retail chains that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail chains and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional or national economy 

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

 

 

 

 

there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by us in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

it is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result should our tenants or their employees or customers be exposed to mold at any of our properties we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property which would reduce our cash available for distribution in addition exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise 

compliance we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

insurance and indemnity in june 2005 we entered into a sevenyear environmental insurance policy june 2005 policy which expires on june 1 2012 on our property portfolio which replaced the previous fiveyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 40000 self insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties 

additionally in december 2009 we entered into a tenyear environmental insurance policy that expires in december 2019 that will initially act in an excess capacity to our june 2005 policy on june 1 2012 this policy will become our primary environmental policy with the same limits as the june 2005 policy except that once we pay a total of 1 million for self insurance retention there will be a 50000 per loss maintenance fee rather than the 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for general environmental claims 

it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation 

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

 

 

 

 

 

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax our subsidiary crest is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property 

distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains each year 

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 355 million acquisition credit facility at december 31 2009 we had borrowings outstanding under our 355 million acquisition credit facility of 46 million and we had a total of 1355 billion of outstanding credit facility borrowings and aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our 355 million credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given the recent disruptions in the financial markets we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

in addition our 355 million credit facility contains provisions that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our 355 million acquisition credit facility provides that the aggregate amount of cash distributions paid on plus any payments made to repurchase our common stock and preferred stock may not exceed the sum of a 95 of our funds from operations as defined in the credit facility plus b cash distributions on our preferred stock determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending except that we may repurchase preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock the credit facility further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries we and our subsidiaries may not pay any distributions on or repurchase any shares of our capital stock including our common stock and preferred stock in addition the credit facility provides that if any other event of default as defined in the credit facility thereunder exists we and our subsidiaries may not pay any distributions on or repurchase any shares of our capital stock including our common stock and preferred stock except that we may pay cash distributions to stockholders in the minimum amount necessary to maintain our status as a reit if this were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the value of our debt securities and may adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or our tax treatment as a reit 

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition over the last two years stock prices in the us markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market value of our common stock has fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between 1000000 and 10000000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders given the recent disruptions in the insurance industry we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the retail netlease industry 

terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or us businesses these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants 

if events like these were to occur they could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

over the last two years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties and may have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants ability to pay rent 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values which are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability which can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust or reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal credit research real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 40 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements primarily 15 to 20 years 

in addition we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 

at december 31 2009 we owned a diversified portfolio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the 2339 properties in the portfolio 2328 or 995 are singletenant retail properties and the remaining 11 are multitenant distribution and office properties at december 31 2009 of the 2328 singletenant properties 2254 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately 112 years 

in addition at december 31 2009 our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiary crest net lease inc crest had an inventory of three properties valued at 38 million which are classified as held for sale crest was created to buy and sell properties primarily to individual investors who are involved in taxdeferred exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” in addition to the three properties crest also holds notes receivable of 222 million at december 31 2009 crest did not acquire any properties in 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital philosophy 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at december 31 2009 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 1355 billion or approximately 308 of our total market capitalization of 440 billion 

  

  

we define our total market capitalization at december 31 2009 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mortgage debt 

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

355 million acquisition credit facility 

in may 2008 we entered into a 355 million revolving unsecured credit facility that replaced our previous 

300 million acquisition credit facility the term of our credit facility is for three years until may 2011 plus two oneyear extension options under our credit facility our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 100 basis points with a facility fee of 275 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 1275 basis points over libor we also have other interest rate options available to us at december 31 2009 we had a borrowing capacity of 3504 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 46 million at an effective interest rate of 123 

we expect to use the credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 100 million to a total borrowing capacity of 455 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our retail properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 10 million 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

acquisitions during 2009 

during 2009 we invested 579 million in 16 new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 97 these 16 properties are located in five states contain over 278000 leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 179 years the 16 new properties we acquired are netleased to four different retail chains there were no acquisitions by crest in 2009 

we made fewer portfolio acquisitions in 2008 and 2009 than in previous years because we felt that preserving our capital resources and maintaining a high level of liquidity until property prices adjusted and the general economy improved was the prudent course of action in late 2009 we felt that market conditions had become more attractive for acquisitions and we currently believe that there are many retail chains with solid operating concepts that are in need of capital we believe that our solid financial position strong balance sheet and access to capital give us the ability to expand our acquisition activities in 2010 and invest in new retail properties that have the potential to contribute to our earnings 

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the aggregate base cash flow or in the case of properties under development the estimated aggregate base cash flow under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total cost of the properties since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

 

  

impact of real estate and credit markets 

in the commercial retail real estate market property prices generally continued to decline and lease rates rose throughout 2008 and 2009 likewise the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have impacted our access to and cost of capital we continue to monitor the commercial retail real estate and us credit markets carefully and if required will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly see our discussion of risk factors in this annual report 

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

we have continued our 40year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased in january 2010 by 00003125 to 0143 the increase in january 2010 was our 49 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 56 th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the new york stock exchange or nyse in 1994 in 2009 we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of 014175 three in the amount of 01420625 three in the amount of 0142375 and three in the amount of 01426875 totaling 1706625 in december 2009 and january 2010 we declared distributions of 0143 per share which were paid in january 2010 and will be paid in february 2010 respectively 

the monthly distribution of 0143 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1716 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 67 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2574 on february 8 2010 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

note redemptions 

upon their maturity in january 2009 we redeemed using cash on hand the 20 million outstanding principal amount of our 8 notes due 2009 or 2009 notes the 2009 notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest we have no debt maturities until march 2013 

universal shelf registration 

in march 2009 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years to replace our prior shelf registration statement which was set to expire in april 2009 our new shelf registration statement expires in march 2012 in accordance with the sec rules the amount of the securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock preferred stock debt securities or any combination of these securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of the offering 

credit agency ratings 

we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes all of these ratings have stable outlooks 

we have also been assigned credit ratings on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moodys has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bb to our preferred stock all of these ratings have stable outlooks 

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2009 sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 

 

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually all of these notes and bonds contain various covenants including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60 ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40 iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 15 times and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150 of our outstanding unsecured debt we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes and bonds was issued 

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes these calculations which are not based on us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our notes only and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2009 are 

 

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2009 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our credit facility and note obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

preferred stock outstanding 

in 2004 we issued 51 million shares of 7375 class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock in may 2009 shares of class d preferred stock became redeemable at our option for 25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class d preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 

in 2006 we issued 88 million shares of 675 class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock beginning december 7 2011 shares of class e preferred stock are redeemable at our option for 25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class e preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 

dividends on our class d and class e preferred stock are current 

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in variable interest entities or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments additionally we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as such our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of offbalance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation of buildings and improvements is generally computed using the straight–line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life no depreciation has been recorded on crests properties that are classified as held for sale 

when acquiring a property for investment purposes we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired with inplace operating leases to 1 land 2 building and improvements 3 identified intangible assets and liabilities based in each case on their fair values intangible assets and liabilities consist of abovemarket and belowmarket leases the value of inplace leases and tenant relationships 

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable generally a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

rental revenue 

rental revenue was 3261 million for 2009 versus 3259 million for 2008 an increase of 249000 or 01 rental revenue was 2851 million in 2007 the increase in rental revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overall comparing 2009 versus 2008 revenue has been generally flat as we own 2339 properties at december 31 2009 compared to 2348 properties at december 31 2008 

of the 2339 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2009 2328 or 995 are singletenant properties and the remaining 11 are multitenant distribution and office properties of the 2328 singletenant properties 2254 or 968 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 112 years at december 31 2009 of our 2254 leased singletenant properties 2071 or 919 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

 

 

 

 

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 13 million in 2009 12 million in 2008 and 795000 in 2007 excluding percentage rent reclassified to discontinued operations of 22000 in 2008 and 55000 in 2007 percentage rent in 2009 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2010 

our portfolio of retail real estate leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases continues to perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2009 our portfolio of 2339 retail properties was 968 leased with 75 properties available for lease as compared to 70 at december 31 2008 

as of february 8 2010 transactions to lease or sell ten of the 75 properties available for lease at december 31 2009 were underway or completed we anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several months although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this period it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 914 million in 2009 versus 899 million in 2008 and 759 million in 2007 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2009 2008 and 2007 which was partially offset by property sales in these years as discussed in the section entitled funds from operations available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo 

interest expense 

interest expense was 855 million in 2009 versus 940 million in 2008 and 643 million in 2007 interest expense decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower average outstanding balances and to a lesser extent lower interest rates we redeemed in november 2008 the 100 million outstanding principal amount of our 825 monthly income senior notes and in january 2009 the 20 million outstanding principal amount of our 8 notes both of which contributed to the decrease in average outstanding balances and lower average interest rates on our debt 

in may 2008 as a result of entering into our current credit facility we incurred 32 million of credit facility origination costs that were capitalized and are being amortized over three years at december 31 2009 15 million of the 32 million is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

 

 

at december 31 2009 the weighted average interest rate on our 

 

 

 

interest coverage ratio 

our interest coverage ratio for 2009 was 35 times for 2008 was 32 times and for 2007 was 41 times interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated in the following table divided by interest expense including interest recorded as discontinued operations we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

the following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flow to our interest coverage amount dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

fixed charge coverage ratio 

our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2009 was 27 times for 2008 was 26 times and for 2007 was 31 times fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures or information presented in exhibit 121 to this annual report 

interest coverage amount divided by interest expense plus preferred stock dividends dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses decreased by 672000 to 209 million in 2009 as compared to 216 million in 2008 general and administrative expenses were 227 million in 2007 in 2009 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 64 as compared to 66 in 2008 and 78 in 2007 general and administrative expenses decreased during 2009 primarily due to decreases in employee costs for 2009 general and administrative expenses include transaction costs of 62000 related to the acquisition of 16 new properties during 2009 prior to 2009 these transaction costs would have been capitalized as part of the property investments 

in february 2010 we had 72 employees as compared to 69 employees in february 2009 

property expenses 

property expenses are broken down into costs associated with nonnet leased multitenant properties unleased singletenant properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to the multitenant and unleased singletenant properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal bad debt expense property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2009 75 properties were available for lease as compared to 70 at december 31 2008 and 48 at december 31 2007 

property expenses were 69 million in 2009 56 million in 2008 and 34 million in 2007 the increase in property expenses in 2009 is primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance and utilities associated with properties available for lease and an increase in bad debt expense partially offset by lower property taxes and legal fees in 2007 property expenses included provisions for impairment of 138000 recorded for one property 

income taxes 

income taxes were 677000 in 2009 as compared to 12 million in 2008 and 14 million in 2007 these amounts are for city and state income taxes paid by realty income after conducting an extensive review of our recent state tax filings we determined that it was appropriate to amend some prior year tax returns from which we realized a tax benefit of 308000 

in addition crest recorded state and federal income tax benefits of 645000 in 2009 as compared to income tax expense of 225000 in 2008 and 30 million in 2007 these amounts are included in income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income the crest 2009 tax benefit includes a benefit of 303000 attributable to amendments of certain prior year state tax returns 

discontinued operations 

crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties consequently we typically classify properties acquired by crest as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them the operation of crest’s properties is classified as income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income 

if we decide not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale the property is reclassified as real estate held for investment a property that is reclassified to held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of i its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment and ii the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 

 

the following is a summary of crest’s income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands except per share data

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

in 2009 we sold 25 investment properties for 203 million which resulted in a gain of 80 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations additionally we received proceeds of 170000 from the sale of excess land from one property which resulted in a gain of 15000 this gain is included in other revenue on our consolidated statement of income for 2009 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations

at december 31 2009 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 83 million as held for sale on our balance sheet which includes three properties owned by crest valued at 38 million additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions if there are attractive opportunities available however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties 

provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest 

in 2009 provisions for impairment of 277000 were recorded by crest on three retail properties held for sale and two properties which were sold in 2009 in 2008 provisions for impairment of 34 million were recorded by crest on three properties held for sale no provisions for impairment were recorded by crest in 2007 these provisions for impairment adjusted the carrying values to the estimated fairmarket values of those properties net of estimated selling costs and are included in income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock cash dividends totaled 243 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1069 million in 2009 a decrease of 714000 as compared to 1076 million in 2008 net income available to common stockholders in 2007 was 1162 million 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

gain from the sale of investment properties and the sale of excess land recognized during 2009 was 81 million as compared to a 136 million gain recognized during 2008 and a 36 million gain recognized during 2007 crest’s recognized no gain from the sale of properties during 2009 as compared to 46 million during 2008 and 123 million during 2007 

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

ffo for 2009 increased by 49 million or 26 to 1904 million as compared to 1855 million in 2008 and 1897 million in 2007 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items 

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back noncash items such as depreciation the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance in addition ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

other noncash items and capitalized expenditures 

the following information includes noncash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio these items are not included in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at ffo analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact of inflation 

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

of our 2339 retail properties in the portfolio approximately 964 or 2254 are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes and bonds primarily at fixed rates we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december 31 2009 we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and fair values as of december 31 2009 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

expected maturity data 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2009 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates our credit facility interest rate is variable based on our credit facility balance of 46 million at december 31 2009 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 46000 per year 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accountancy or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that

changes in internal controls 

there were no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2009 as of december 31 2009 there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

recent developments 

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

we continue our 39year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share increased in january 2009 by 0000625 to 014175 the increase in january 2009 was our 45 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 52 nd increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2008 we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of 013675 three in the amount of 0137375 two in the amount of 0138 one in the amount of 01405 and three in the amount of 0141125 totaling 166225 in december 2008 and january 2009 we declared distributions of 014175 per share which were paid in january 2009 and will be paid in february 2009 respectively 

the monthly distribution of 014175 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1701 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 84 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2019 on february 9 2009 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

acquisitions during 2008 

during 2008 realty income invested 1896 million in 108 new retail properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 87 1814 million of these acquisitions occurred in the first quarter of 2008 while only 82 million was invested during the remainder of 2008 these 108 properties are located in 14 states contain over 714000 leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 206 years the 108 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to eight different retail chains in the following seven industries automotive tire service convenience store drug store financial services motor vehicle dealership restaurant and theater there were no acquisitions by crest in 2008 

our 2008 portfolio acquisitions were lower than in recent years primarily due to uncertainty in the commercial retail real estate market property prices continued to decline and lease rates rose throughout 2008 we continue to monitor the acquisition market carefully and will acquire properties for longterm investment when we believe the transactions are accretive to our shareholders 

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

investments in existing properties

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1076 million in 2008 versus 1162 million in 2007 a decrease of 86 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 106 per share in 2008 as compared to 116 per share in 2007 

 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sales of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

the gain recognized during 2008 from the sales of investment properties and from the additional proceeds received from a sale of excess land was 136 million as compared to a 36 million gain recognized from the sales of investment properties and excess land during 2007 

funds from operations ffo 

in 2008 our ffo decreased by 42 million or 22 to 1855 million versus 1897 million in 2007 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 183 in 2008 compared to 189 in 2007 a decrease of 006 or 32 

see our discussion of ffo in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo 

crest’s property sales 

during 2008 crest sold 25 properties from its inventory for an aggregate of 507 million which resulted in a gain of 46 million crest’s gains are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” on our consolidated statements of income 

crest’s property inventory 

crest’s had an inventory of five properties with a carrying value of 60 million at december 31 2008 which is included in “real estate held for sale net” on our consolidated balance sheet 

distribution policy 

distributions are paid monthly to our common class d preferred and class e preferred stockholders if and when declared by our board of directors 

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains in 2008 our cash distributions totaled 1939 million or approximately 1227 of our estimated reit taxable income of 1580 million our estimated reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization our estimated reit taxable income is presented to show our compliance with reit distribution requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or performance 

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes our 2008 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 1697 million representing 915 of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of 1855 million 

the class d preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 184375 per annum per share the class e preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 675 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 16875 per annum per share 

 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the tax code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute qualified dividend income subject to a reduced tax rate the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” has generally been reduced to 15 until it “sunsets” or reverts to the provisions of prior law which under current law will occur with respect to taxable years beginning after december 31 2010 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends except to the extent the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year or as discussed above dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends” distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock distributions above that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 188 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2008 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital 

business philosophy and strategy 

investment philosophy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of retail properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm leases coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property expenses generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

investment strategy 

in identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is generally on providing capital to retail chain owners and operators by acquiring then leasing back retail store locations we categorize retail tenants as 1 venture market 2 middle market and 3 upper market venture companies typically offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and 50 retail locations middle market retail chains typically have 50 to 500 retail locations operations in more than one geographic region have been successful through one or more economic cycles and have a proven replicable concept the upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500 or more locations operating nationally in a proven mature retail concept upper market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital 

 

we primarily focus on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because 

 

 

 

 

 

we also focus on and have selectively made investments in properties of upper market retail chains we believe upper market retail chains can be attractive for investment because 

 

 

 

 

 

while our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to middle and upper market retail chains we also selectively seek investment opportunities with venture market retail chains periodically venture market opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices to meet our stringent investment standards however venture retail companies must have a welldefined retailing concept and strong financial prospects these opportunities are examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in making investments in this area 

historically our investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2008 approximately 832 of our rental revenue was derived from retailers with a service component in their business furthermore we believe these serviceoriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internet businesses 

credit strategy 

we generally provide saleleaseback financing to less than investment grade retail chains we typically acquire and lease back properties to regional and national retail chains and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers since 1970 our overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 984 and the occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 97 

we believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its retail business we believe the risk of default on a retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers’ individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

 

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

 

 

 

 

the typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more retail locations generally the properties

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national retail chains are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale advertising and the selection of prime retail locations we execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain store owners and operators doing business in a variety of industries by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting real estate for potential investment we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portfolio management strategy 

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality our executives review industry research tenant research property due diligence and significant portfolio management activities this monitoring typically includes regular review and analysis of 

 

 

 

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2008 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 67 million as held for sale on our balance sheet which includes 60 million for properties owned by crest additionally we anticipate selling investment properties in our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

 

universal shelf registration 

in april 2006 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years in accordance with the sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock preferred stock debt securities or any combination of such securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering there is no specific limit to the dollar amount of new securities that can be issued under this shelf registration before it expires in april 2009 and our common stock preferred stock and notes issued after april 2006 were all issued pursuant to this universal shelf registration statement our plan is to file a new shelf registration statement prior to april 2009 when our existing shelf registration statement expires 

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 9 2009 our total outstanding borrowings were 135 billion of senior unsecured notes or approximately 355 of our total market capitalization of 380 billion we had no borrowings on our 355 million credit facility 

we define our total market capitalization at february 9 2009 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 

355 million acquisition credit facility 

in may 2008 we entered into a new 355 million revolving unsecured credit facility which replaced our existing 300 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in october 2008 the term of the new credit facility is for three years until may 2011 plus two oneyear extension options under the new credit facility our investment grade credit ratings provided for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 100 basis points with a facility fee of 275 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 1275 basis points over libor we also have other interest rate options available to us at february 9 2009 we had a borrowing capacity of 355 million available on our new credit facility and no outstanding balance 

we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 100 million to a total borrowing capacity of 455 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to the approval of our credit facility’s lending banks 

we use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions when outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a certain level generally in the range of 100 million to 200 million and capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock convertible preferred stock debt securities or convertible debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

credit agency ratings 

we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes all of these ratings have “stable” outlooks 

we have also been assigned credit ratings on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bb to our preferred stock all of these ratings have “stable” outlooks 

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

mortgage debt 

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatory redeemable preferred stock our financial position or results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standards no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

competitive strategy 

we believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

this “risk factors” section contains references to our capital stock and to our stockholders unless expressly stated otherwise the references to our capital stock represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock while the references to our stockholders represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock 

in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures 

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

 

 

 

 

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants or the industries in which they operate could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants release space collect rent or renew leases which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth 

cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at any time any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition as a result a tenant may delay lease commencement fail to make rental payments when due decline to extend a lease upon its expiration become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us 

if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire we may not be able to rent or sell the properties furthermore leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are released may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations tenant improvements or lease transaction costs negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value which could result in impairments any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness a significant portion of the costs of owning property such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties in a weakened financial condition tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them 

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full as a result tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

seventy of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2008 of which all but one were singletenant properties as of february 9 2009 transactions to lease or sell 13 of the 70 properties were underway or completed at december 31 2008 30 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2008 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

for 2008 our tenants in the restaurant and convenience store industries accounted for approximately 208 and 164 respectively of our rental revenue a downturn in either of these industries whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect our tenants in these industries which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2008 nevertheless downturns in these other industries could also adversely affect our tenants which in turn could also have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to make debt payments and distributions on our common and preferred stock 

in addition a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket retail chains that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail chains and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional or national economy 

on january 22 2008 buffets holdings inc “buffets holdings” together with each of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code realty income owned 116 properties and crest owned three properties leased to subsidiaries of buffets inc “buffets” and guaranteed by buffets buffets is a subsidiary of buffets holdings in february 2008 buffets holdings elected to reject the leases for 12 properties owned by realty income and two properties owned by crest and returned those 14 properties to us in july 2008 realty income reached an agreement with buffets holdings for the continued lease of all of its remaining properties the terms of the agreement were approved by the bankruptcy court on september 15 2008 under the terms of the agreement all 105 of the remaining leases including 104 owned by realty income and one owned by crest will be assumed and continue to be operated by buffets holdings rents were modified on many of the assumed properties from an annualized rent of 224 million to 194 million or 87 of previous rents in addition the majority of the leases call for annual increases in rent buffets holdings continues to be our largest tenant and represents approximately 60 of realty income’s annualized lease revenue as of december 31 2008 

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

 

 

 

 

there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances 

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

 

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by the company in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

it is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result should our tenants or their employees be exposed to mold at any of our properties we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property which would reduce our cash available for distribution in addition exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise 

compliance we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms 

insurance and indemnity in june 2005 we entered into a sevenyear environmental insurance policy on our property portfolio which replaced the previous fiveyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 40000 self insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all 

our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located 

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

 

 

 

 

 

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax our subsidiary crest is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property 

distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains each year 

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interest of holders of our common stock 

 

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 355 million acquisition credit facility at february 9 2009 we had no borrowings outstanding under our 355 million acquisition credit facility and we had 135 billion of aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our 355 million credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due given the recent disruptions in the financial markets we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our credit facility may not be able to lend us money 

in addition our 355 million credit facility contains provisions that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us on our common stock and preferred stock in particular our 355 million acquisition credit facility provides that the aggregate amount of cash distributions paid on plus any payments made to repurchase our common stock and preferred stock may not exceed the sum of a 95 of our funds from operations as defined in the credit facility plus b cash distributions on our preferred stock determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending except that we may repurchase preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock the credit facility further provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal interest or any other amount payable there under when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries we and our subsidiaries may not pay distributions on or repurchase any shares of our capital stock including our common stock and preferred stock in addition the credit facility provides that if any other event of default as defined in the credit facility thereunder occurs we and our subsidiaries may not pay any distributions on or repurchase any shares of our capital stock including our common stock and preferred stock except that we may pay cash distributions to stockholders in the minimum amount necessary to maintain our status as a reit if this were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the value of our debt securities and may adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or our tax treatment as a reit 

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition stock prices in the us markets have recently been experiencing extreme price fluctuations and the market value of our common stock has fluctuated significantly during this period as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial and rapid in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between 1000000 and 10000000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates 

 

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders given the recent disruptions in the insurance industry we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the retail netlease industry 

terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or us businesses these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants 

 

such events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock 

the united states stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and may have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 

inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent provided for in our leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation likewise even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements 

various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to asset and liability valuations or potential impairments and various receivables often these estimates require the use of market data values which are currently difficult to assess as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability which can also be difficult to accurately predict although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our retail properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 468 million we used 20 million of this amount to retire our 80 notes that matured in january 2009 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

355 million acquisition credit facility 

in may 2008 we entered into a new 355 million revolving unsecured credit facility which replaced our existing 300 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in october 2008 the term of the new credit facility is for three years until may 2011 plus two oneyear extension options under the new credit facility our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 100 basis points with a facility fee of 275 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 1275 basis points over libor we also have other interest rate options available to us at february 9 2009 we had a borrowing capacity of 355 million available on our new credit facility and no outstanding balance 

we expect to use the credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility up to 100 million to a total borrowing capacity of 455 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks on our credit facility 

issuance of common stock 

in september 2008 we issued 2925000 shares of common stock at a price of 2682 per share the net proceeds of 744 million were used along with our available cash on hand to repay the 100 million outstanding principal amount of our 825 monthly income senior notes “2008 notes” in november 2008 and the 20 million outstanding principal amount of our 8 notes “2009 notes” in january 2009 

note redemptions 

in november 2008 we redeemed the 100 million outstanding principal amount of our 2008 notes in january 2009 we redeemed the 20 million outstanding principal amount of our 2009 notes the 2008 notes and 2009 notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest we now have no debt maturities until 2013 

mortgage debt 

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

universal shelf registration 

in april 2006 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years in accordance with the sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock preferred stock debt securities or any combination of such securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering there is no specific limit to the dollar amount of new securities that can be issued under this shelf registration before it expires in april 2009 and our common stock preferred stock and notes issued after april 2006 were all issued pursuant to this universal shelf registration statement our plan is to file a new shelf registration statement prior to april 2009 when our existing shelf registration statement expires 

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 9 2009 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 135 billion or approximately 355 of our total market capitalization of 380 billion 

we define our total market capitalization at february 9 2009 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 

credit agency ratings 

we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes all of these ratings have “stable” outlooks 

we have also been assigned credit ratings on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bb to our preferred stock all of these ratings have “stable” outlooks 

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2008 sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 

 

 

1 in january 2009 the 8 notes were paid off and the balance of our outstanding notes was reduced to 135 billion 

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 

interest on all of the senior note obligations is paid semiannually all of these notes contain various covenants including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60 ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40 iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 15 times and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150 of our outstanding unsecured debt we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were issued 

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants to our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes these calculations which are not based on gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our notes only and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2008 are 

 

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2008 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our credit facility and note obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

preferred stock outstanding 

in 2004 we issued 51 million shares of 7375 class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock beginning may 27 2009 shares of class d preferred stock are redeemable at our option for 25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class d preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 

in december 2006 we issued 88 million shares of 675 class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock beginning december 7 2011 shares of class e preferred stock are redeemable at our option for 25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class e preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatory redeemable preferred stock our financial position or results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standard board interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

acquisitions during 2008 

during 2008 realty income invested 1896 million in 108 new retail properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 87 1814 million of these acquisitions occurred in the first quarter of 2008 while only 82 million was invested during the remainder of 2008 these 108 properties are located in 14 states contain over 714000 leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 206 years the 108 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to eight different retail chains in the following seven industries automotive tire service convenience store drug store financial services motor vehicle dealership restaurant and theater there were no acquisitions by crest in 2008 

our 2008 portfolio acquisitions were lower than in recent years primarily due to uncertainty in the commercial retail real estate market property prices continued to decline and lease rates rose throughout 2008 we continue to monitor the acquisition market carefully and will acquire properties for longterm investment when we believe the transactions are accretive to our shareholders 

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

we continue our 39year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased in january 2009 by 0000625 to 014175 the increase in january 2009 was our 45 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 52 nd increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the new york stock exchange or nyse in 1994 in 2008 we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of 013675 three in the amount of 0137375 two in the amount of 0138 one in the amount of 01405 and three in the amount of 0141125 totaling 166225 in december 2008 and january 2009 we declared distributions of 014175 per share which were paid in january 2009 and will be paid in february 2009 respectively 

the monthly distribution of 014175 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1701 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 84 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2019 on february 9 2009 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

 

results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation of buildings and improvements is generally computed using the straight–line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life no depreciation has been recorded on properties that are classified as held for sale 

when we acquire a property for investment purposes we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the components typically include i land ii building and improvements iii intangible assets related to above and below market leases and iv value of costs to obtain tenants 

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable generally a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

rental revenue 

rental revenue was 3283 million for 2008 versus 2880 million for 2007 an increase of 403 million or 140 rental revenue was 2354 million in 2006 the increase in rental revenue in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excluding 104 leases with buffets holdings inc same store rents generated on 1668 properties during the entire years of 2008 and 2007 increased in 2008 by 32 million or 14 to 2371 million from 2339 million in 2007 

of the 2348 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2008 2337 or 995 are singletenant properties and the remaining 11 are multitenant properties of the 2337 singletenant properties 2268 or 970 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 119 years at december 31 2008 of our 2268 leased singletenant properties 2066 or 911 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 13 million in 2008 831000 in 2007 and 11 million in 2006 percentage rent in 2008 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2009 

our portfolio of retail real estate leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases continues to perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2008 our portfolio of 2348 retail properties was 970 leased with 70 properties available for lease one of which is a multitenant property 

as of february 9 2009 transactions to lease or sell 13 of the 70 properties available for lease at december 31 2008 were underway or completed we anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several months although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this period it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 3 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 

interest expense 

interest expense was 940 million in 2008 versus 643 million in 2007 and 514 million in 2006 interest expense increased in 2008 primarily due to higher average senior notes outstanding and to a lesser extent due to higher interest rates we issued 550 million of 12year notes in september 2007 which contributed to the increase in average outstanding balances and higher average interest rates on our debt 

in may 2008 as a result of entering into our new credit facility we incurred 32 million of credit facility origination costs which were capitalized to other assets also we expensed 235000 of unamortized credit facility origination costs from our prior credit facility which are included in amortization of credit facility origination costs in the table below 

 

 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

 

 

at february 9 2009 the weighted average interest rate on our notes payable of 135 billion was 610 and the average interest rate on our credit line was 145 there was no outstanding balance on our credit line at february 9 2009 

interest coverage ratio 

our interest coverage ratio for 2008 was 32 times and for 2007 and 2006 was 41 times interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated in the following table divided by interest expense including interest recorded as discontinued operations we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

the following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flow to our interest coverage amount dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

fixed charge coverage ratio 

our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2008 was 26 times for 2007 was 31 times and for 2006 was 34 times fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures or information presented in exhibit 121 to this annual report 

interest coverage amount divided by interest expense plus preferred stock dividends dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 907 million in 2008 versus 767 million in 2007 and 588 million in 2006 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2008 and 2007 were due to the acquisition of properties in 2008 2007 and 2006 which was partially offset by property sales in these years as discussed in the section entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is excluded from our calculation of ffo 

 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses decreased by 11 million to 216 million in 2008 as compared to 227 million in 2007 general and administrative expenses were 175 million in 2006 in 2008 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 65 as compared to 77 in 2007 and 74 in 2006 general and administrative expenses decreased during 2008 primarily due to decreases in employee costs 

in february 2009 we had 69 permanent employees as compared to 75 permanent employees in february 2008 

property expenses 

property expenses are broken down into costs associated with nonnet leased multitenant properties unleased singletenant properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to the multitenant and unleased singletenant properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal bad debt expense property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2008 70 properties were available for lease as compared to 48 at december 31 2007 and 26 at december 31 2006 

property expenses were 58 million in 2008 35 million in 2007 and 33 million in 2006 the increase in property expenses in 2008 is primarily attributable to an increase in property taxes maintenance utilities legal fees and bad debt expense associated with properties available for lease in 2007 property expenses included provisions for impairment of 138000 recorded for one property 

income taxes 

income taxes were 12 million in 2008 as compared to 14 million in 2007 and 747000 in 2006 these amounts are for city and state income taxes paid by realty income 

in addition crest incurred state and federal income taxes of 225000 in 2008 as compared to 30 million in 2007 and 494000 in 2006 these amounts are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” on our consolidated statements of income 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in september 2006 we redeemed all of our outstanding 110 million 775 unsecured notes due may 2007 the “2007 notes” the 2007 notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2007 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest as well as a makewhole payment of 16 million the makewhole payment was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt on our 2006 consolidated statement of income for 2006 the makewhole payment represented approximately 0017 per share 

discontinued operations 

crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties consequently we classify properties acquired by crest as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them the operation of crest’s properties is classified as “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” on our consolidated statements of income 

if we decide not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale the property is reclassified as real estate held for investment a property that is reclassified to held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of i its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment and ii the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 

 

the following is a summary of crest’s “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale” on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

 

 

1 depreciation was recorded on one property that was classified as held for investment this property was sold in 2008 

realty income’s operations from two investment properties classified as held for sale at december 31 2008 plus properties sold in 2008 2007 and 2006 have been classified as discontinued operations the following is a summary of realty income’s “income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment” on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

 

 

the following is a summary of our total income from discontinued operations dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

the above per share amounts have each been calculated independently 

crest’s property sales 

in 2008 crest sold 25 properties for 507 million which resulted in a gain of 46 million as part of two sales during 2008 crest provided partial financing to the buyers of 192 million in 2007 crest sold 62 properties for 1236 million which resulted in a gain of 123 million in 2007 as part of two sales crest provided partial financing to the buyer of 38 million of which 619000 was paid in full in november 2007 in 2006 crest sold 13 properties for 224 million which resulted in a gain of 22 million in 2005 as part of one sale crest provided partial buyer financing of 13 million which was paid in full in february 2006 crest’s gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are included in discontinued operations 

crest’s property inventory 

at december 31 2008 crest had an inventory of five properties with a carrying value of 60 million all of which are classified as held for sale at december 31 2007 crest had a property inventory of 30 properties with a carrying value of 562 million 

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

in 2008 we sold 29 investment properties for an aggregate of 274 million which resulted in a gain of 133 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations additionally we received proceeds of 439000 from the sale of excess land from one property which resulted in a gain of 236000 this gain is included in “other revenue” on our consolidated statements of income because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations 

in 2007 we sold ten investment properties for 70 million which resulted in a gain of 17 million the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations in addition we sold excess land and improvements from five properties for an aggregate of 44 million which resulted in a gain of 18 million this gain from the land and improvements sales is reported in “other revenue” on our consolidated statements of income because these improvements and excess land were associated with properties that continue to be owned as part of our core operations 

in 2006 we sold or exchanged 13 investment properties for 107 million which resulted in a gain of 30 million which is included in discontinued operations 

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2008 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 67 million as held for sale on our balance sheet which includes five properties owned by crest with a carrying value of 60 million additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that we have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest 

in 2008 provisions for impairment of 34 million were recorded by crest on three properties held for sale in february 2008 buffets holdings elected to reject the leases for two of these three properties no provisions for impairment were recorded by crest in 2007 in 2006 provisions for impairment of 12 million were recorded by crest on three properties one of the three properties was sold in 2007 and the other two properties were sold in 2008 the above provisions for impairment reduced the carrying costs to the estimated fairmarket value of those properties net of estimated selling costs and are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

provisions for impairment on realty income investment properties 

no provisions for impairment were recorded in 2008  in 2007 we recorded a provision for impairment of 134000 on one property which is included in “income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment” on our consolidated statements of income as the property was subsequently sold additionally we recorded a provision for impairment of 138000 on another property in 2007 which is included in property expense on our consolidated statements of income in 2006 we recorded a provision for impairment of 16000 on one property which is included in “income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment” 

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock cash dividends totaled 243 million in 2008 and 2007 as compared to 114 million in 2006 

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1076 million in 2008 a decrease of 86 million as compared to 1162 million in 2007 net income available to common stockholders in 2006 was 994 million 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sales of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

during 2008 the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties and from the additional proceeds received from a sale of excess land was 136 million as compared to gains recognized from the sales of investment properties of 36 million during 2007 and 30 million during 2006 crest’s gain recognized from the sale of properties during 2008 was 46 million as compared to 123 million during 2007 and 22 million during 2006 

 

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

ffo for 2008 decreased by 42 million or 22 to 1855 million as compared to 1897 million in 2007 and 1558 million in 2006 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items 

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes noncash items such as depreciation the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance in addition ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

 

other noncash items and capitalized expenditures 

the following information includes noncash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio these items are not included in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at ffo analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 

 

 

 

 

 

impact of inflation 

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

approximately 966 or 2268 of our 2348 retail properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes primarily at fixed rates and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december 31 2008 we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and fair values as of december 31 2008 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

expected maturity data 

 

1  20 million matured and was retired in january 2009 

 

 

 

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2008 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates our credit facility interest rate is variable at december 31 2008 our credit facility balance was zero however we intend to borrow funds on our credit facility in the future based on a hypothetical credit facility borrowing of 50 million a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 500000 per year 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accountancy or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act 1934 rules 13a15e and 15d15e that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting  

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

 

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

 

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company

changes in internal controls there have not been any significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

recent developments 

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

we continue our 38year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased in april 2007 by 0000625 to 0127125 in july 2007 by 0000625 to 012775 in september 2007 by 000775 to 01355 in october 2007 by 0000625 to 0136125 and in january 2008 by 0000625 to 013675 the increase in january 2008 was our 41st consecutive quarterly increase and the 47th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the new york stock exchange or nyse in 1994 in 2007 we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of 01265 three in the amount of 0127125 two in the amount of 012775 one in the amount of 01355 and three in the amount of 0136125 totaling 156025 in december 2007 and january 2008 we declared distributions of 013675 per share which were paid in january 2008 and will be paid in february 2008 respectively 

the monthly distribution of 013675 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1641 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 65 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2515 on february 1 2008 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

 

acquisitions during 2007 

during 2007 realty income and crest invested 5337 million in aggregate in 357 new retail properties and properties under development these 357 new properties are located in 38 states will contain over 19 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 193 years as described below realty income acquired 325 properties and crest acquired 32 properties 

included in the 5337 million is 5038 million invested by realty income in 325 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 86 these 325 properties are located in 38 states will contain over 18 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 192 years the 325 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to 16 different retail chains in the following nine industries automotive service automotive tire service convenience store distribution and office drug store grocery health and fitness restaurant and sporting goods also included in the 5337 million is 299 million invested by crest in 32 new restaurant properties 

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

investments in existing properties 

in 2007 we capitalized costs of 19 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 614000 for releasing costs and 13 million for building improvements 

issuance of 12year senior unsecured notes 

in september 2007 we issued 550 million in aggregate principal amount of 675 senior unsecured notes due 2019 the “2019 notes” the price to the investor for the 2019 notes was 99827 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6772 the net proceeds of approximately 5444 million from this offering were used to fund certain acquisitions repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and for general corporate purposes the remaining net proceeds which are included in “cash and cash equivalents” on our 2007 consolidated balance sheet will be used for general corporate purposes which include additional property acquisitions interest on the 2019 notes is paid semiannually 

credit ratings upgrade 

in april 2007 moody’s investors service upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to baa1 from baa2 and our preferred stock rating to baa2 from baa3 with a stable outlook 

standard  poor’s midcap 400 index 

in november 2007 we were added to the standard  poor’s “sp” midcap 400 index the sp midcap 400 stock index covers companies with market capitalizations in the range of 15 billion to 55 billion and is part of a series of sp indices 

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1162 million in 2007 versus 994 million in 2006 an increase of 168 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 116 per share in 2007 as compared to 111 per share in 2006 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes the gain from the sales of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2007 was 36 million as compared to 30 million for 2006 

 

funds from operations ffo 

in 2007 our ffo increased by 339 million or 218 to 1897 million versus 1558 million in 2006 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 189 in 2007 compared to 173 for 2006 an increase of 016 or 92 

see our discussion of ffo in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo 

crest’s property sales 

during 2007 crest sold 62 properties from its inventory for an aggregate of 1236 million which resulted in a gain of 123 million crest’s gains are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” on our consolidated statements of income 

crest’s property inventory 

crest’s property inventory at december 31 2007 totaled 562 million these properties are included in “real estate held for sale net” on our consolidated balance sheets 

distribution policy 

distributions are paid monthly to our common class d preferred and class e preferred stockholders if and when declared by our board of directors 

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains in 2007 our cash distributions totaled 1822 million or approximately 1136 of our estimated reit taxable income of 1604 million our estimated reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes our 2007 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 1577 million representing 831 of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of 1897 million 

the class d preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 184375 per annum per share the class e preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 675 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 16875 per annum per share 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the tax code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute qualified dividend income subject to a reduced tax rate the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” has generally been reduced to 15 until it “sunsets” or reverts to the provisions of prior law which under current law will occur with respect to taxable years beginning after december 31 2010 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for 

  

  

the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends except to the extent the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year or as discussed above dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends” distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock distributions above that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset approximately 112 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2007 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital 

business philosophy and strategy 

investment philosophy 

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of retail properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm leases coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property expenses generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

investment strategy 

in identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is generally on providing capital to retail chain owners and operators by acquiring then leasing back retail store locations we categorize retail tenants as 1 venture market 2 middle market and 3 upper market venture companies typically offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and 50 retail locations middle market retail chains typically have 50 to 500 retail locations operations in more than one geographic region have been successful through one or more economic cycles and have a proven replicable concept the upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500 or more locations operating nationally in a proven mature retail concept upper market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital 

realty income primarily focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because 

 

 

 

 

 

we also focus on and have selectively made investments in properties of upper market retail chains we believe upper market retail chains can be attractive for investment because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to middle and upper market retail chains we also selectively seek investment opportunities with venture market retail chains periodically venture market opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices to meet our stringent investment standards however venture retail companies must have a welldefined retailing concept and strong financial prospects these opportunities are examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in making investments in this area 

historically our investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2007 approximately 845 of our rental revenue was derived from retailers with a service component in their business furthermore we believe these serviceoriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internet businesses 

credit strategy 

we generally provide saleleaseback financing to less than investment grade retail chains we typically acquire and lease back properties to regional and national retail chains and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers since 1970 our overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 985 and the occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 975 

we believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its retail business we believe the risk of default on a retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers’ individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

 

 

 

 

the typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more retail locations generally the properties 

 

 

 

 

acquisition strategy 

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national retail chains are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale advertising and the selection of prime retail locations we execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain store owners and operators doing business in a variety of industries by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting real estate for potential investment we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portfolio management strategy 

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested we also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality our executives review industry research tenant research property due diligence and significant portfolio management activities this monitoring typically includes regular review and analysis of 

 

 

 

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2007 we classified real estate owned by crest with a carrying amount of 562 million as held for sale on our balance sheet additionally we anticipate selling investment properties in our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

universal shelf registration 

in april 2006 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years in accordance with the sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock preferred stock debt securities or any combination of such securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering there is no specific limit to the dollar amount of new securities that can be issued under this new shelf registration before it expires in april 2009 and our common stock preferred stock and notes issued after april 2006 were all issued pursuant to this universal shelf registration statement 

 

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 1 2008 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 147 billion or approximately 337 of our total market capitalization of 436 billion 

we define our total market capitalization at february 1 2008 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 

300 million acquisition credit facility 

we have a 300 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2008 in april 2007 moody’s investors service upgraded our credit ratings effective may 2007 our investment grade credit ratings provided for financing under the credit facility at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 60 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 15 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 75 basis points over libor at february 1 2008 we had a borrowing capacity of 300 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding balance 

we expect to use the credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility by up to 100 million to a total borrowing capacity of 400 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks of our credit facility 

we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend renew or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate we have the right to extend the credit facility for an additional term of one year to october 2009 

we use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions when outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a certain level generally in the range of 100 million to 200 million and capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock convertible preferred stock debt securities or convertible debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

 

credit agency ratings 

we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes the rating by standard  poor’s has a “positive” outlook and the ratings by fitch and moody’s have “stable” outlooks 

we have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our preferred stock the rating by standard  poor’s has a “positive” outlook and the ratings by fitch and moody’s have “stable” outlooks 

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that any such rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

mortgage debt 

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatory redeemable preferred stock our current financial position or results of operations are not affected by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standards no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

competitive strategy 

we believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

as used under this caption “risk factors” references to our capital stock include our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock and references to our stockholders include holders of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock in each case unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires 

in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties which may be subject to competitive pressures 

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

 

 

 

 

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent may be affected by competition within their industries from other operators 

the tenants leasing our properties can face significant competition from other operators this competition may adversely impact 

 

 

further the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from that tenant’s lease or leases in addition a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us if that happens our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that might be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases in addition any claim we have for unpaid past rent if any may not be paid in full 

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

 

 

 

 

there may be environmental problems of which we are unaware associated with our properties in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for release of hazardous substances 

  

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by the company in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

it is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of mold to which our tenants or their employees could be exposed at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property which would reduce our cash available for distribution in addition exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise 

compliance we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms 

insurance and indemnity in june 2005 we entered into a sevenyear environmental insurance policy on our property portfolio which replaced the previous fiveyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 40000 self insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all 

our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located 

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualifications as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

 

 

 

 

 

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax our subsidiary crest is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property 

distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains each year 

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of our common stock 

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 300 million acquisition credit facility at february 1 2008 we had no borrowings outstanding under our 300 million acquisition credit facility and a total of 147 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our 300 million credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due in addition our 300 million credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us on our common stock and preferred stock in the event of deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition and our 300 million credit facility provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal of or interest on borrowings there under when due subject to any applicable grace period we and our subsidiaries may not pay any dividends on our capital stock including our outstanding common and preferred stock if this were to occur it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the value of our debt securities 

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock including 

 

 

 

 

 

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

we are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenants expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between 1000000 and 10000000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which it operates 

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operation 

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

property taxes may increase without notice 

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the retail netlease industry 

terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants 

such events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 

the united states credit markets have recently experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions a prolonged downturn in the credit markets could cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the united states which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock these disruptions in the financial markets also may have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition 

and results of operations 

general 

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust or reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal retail research real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 38 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements primarily 15 to 20 years 

in addition we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties at december 31 2007 we owned a diversified portfolio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the 2270 properties in the portfolio 2259 or 995 are singletenant retail properties and the remaining 11 are multitenant distribution and office properties at december 31 2007 2212 or 979 of the 2259 singletenant properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately 130 years 

in addition at december 31 2007 our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiary crest net lease inc “crest” had invested 562 million in 30 properties which are classified as held for sale crest was created to buy and sell properties primarily to individual investors who are involved in taxdeferred exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “tax code” 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash reserves 

we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our retail properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2007 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 1931 million which represents a portion of the proceeds from the september 2007 issuance of 550 million of 675 senior unsecured notes 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

300 million acquisition credit facility 

we have a 300 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2008 in april 2007 moody’s investors service upgraded our credit ratings since may 2007 our investment grade credit ratings provided for financing under the credit facility at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 60 basis points with a facility fee of 15 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 75 basis points over libor at february 1 2008 we had a borrowing capacity of 300 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding balance 

we expect to use the credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility by up to 100 million to a total borrowing capacity of 400 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks on our credit facility 

we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend renew or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate we have the right to extend the credit facility for an additional term of one year to october 2009 

mortgage debt 

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

universal shelf registration 

in april 2006 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years in accordance with the sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock preferred stock debt securities or any combination of such securities we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering there is no specific limit to the dollar amount of new securities that can be issued under this new shelf registration before it expires in april 2009 and our common stock preferred stock and notes issued after april 2006 were all issued pursuant to this universal shelf registration statement 

conservative capital structure 

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 1 2008 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 147 billion or approximately 337 of our total market capitalization of 436 billion 

we define our total market capitalization at february 1 2008 as the sum of 

 

 

 

 

 

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that common stock may be the majority of our capital structure however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

  

credit agency ratings 

we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes the rating by standard  poor’s has a “positive” outlook and the ratings by fitch and moody’s have “stable” outlooks 

we have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our preferred stock the rating by standard  poor’s has a “positive” outlook and the ratings by fitch and moody’s have “stable” outlooks 

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that any such rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

notes outstanding 

our senior unsecured note obligations consist of the following as of december 31 2007 sorted by maturity date dollars in millions 

 

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 

interest on all of the senior note obligations is paid semiannually with the exception of the interest on the 825 senior notes issued in october 1998 which is paid monthly all of these notes contain various covenants including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60 ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40 iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 15 times and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150 of our outstanding unsecured debt we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were issued 

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants to our senior unsecured notes as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes these calculations which are not based on gaap measurements are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our notes only and are not measures of our liquidity or performance the actual amounts as of december 31 2007 are 

 

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2007 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our credit facility and note obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

we anticipate paying off the notes due in 2008 and 2009 by one or more of the following using cash on hand utilizing our credit facility or issuing new securities 

preferred stock outstanding 

in 2004 we issued 51 million shares of 7375 class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock beginning may 27 2009 shares of class d preferred stock are redeemable at our option for 25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class d preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 

in december 2006 we issued 88 million shares of 675 class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock beginning december 7 2011 shares of class e preferred stock are redeemable at our option for 25 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class e preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

we have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatory redeemable preferred stock our financial position or results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standard board interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

acquisitions during 2007 

during 2007 realty income and crest invested 5337 million in aggregate in 357 new retail properties and properties under development these 357 new properties are located in 38 states will contain over 19 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 193 years as described below realty income acquired 325 properties and crest acquired 32 properties 

included in the 5337 million is 5038 million invested by realty income in 325 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 86 these 325 properties are located in 38 states will contain over 18 million leasable square feet and are 100 leased with an average lease term of 192 years the 325 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to 16 different retail chains in the following nine industries automotive service automotive tire service convenience store distribution and office drug store grocery health and fitness restaurant and sporting goods also included in the 5337 million is 299 million invested by crest in 32 new restaurant properties 

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property that is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

we continue our 38year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased in april 2007 by 0000625 to 0127125 in july 2007 by 0000625 to 012775 in september 2007 by 000775 to 01355 in october 2007 by 0000625 to 0136125 and in january 2008 by 0000625 to 013675 the increase in january 2008 was our 41st consecutive quarterly increase and the 47th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the new york stock exchange or nyse in 1994 in 2007 we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of 01265 three in the amount of 0127125 two in the amount of 012775 one in the amount of 01355 and three in the amount of 0136125 totaling 156025 in december 2007 and january 2008 we declared distributions of 013675 per share which were paid in january 2008 and will be paid in february 2008 respectively 

the monthly distribution of 013675 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1641 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 65 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2515 on february 1 2008 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation of buildings and improvements is generally computed using the straight–line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life no depreciation has been recorded on crest’s properties because they are held for sale 

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable generally a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

rental revenue 

rental revenue was 2902 million for 2007 versus 2375 million for 2006 an increase of 527 million or 222 rental revenue was 1951 million in 2005 the increase in rental revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the 2270 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2007 2259 or 995 are singletenant properties and the remaining 11 are multitenant properties of the 2259 singletenant properties 2212 or 979 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 130 years at december 31 2007 of our 2212 leased singletenant properties 1999 or 904 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 836000 in 2007 11 million in 2006 and 11 million in 2005 percentage rent in 2007 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2008 

our portfolio of retail real estate leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases continues to perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2007 our portfolio of 2270 retail properties was 979 leased with 48 properties available for lease one of which is a multitenant property 

as of february 1 2008 transactions to lease or sell 17 of the 48 properties available for lease at december 31 2007 were underway or completed we anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several months although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this period it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 3 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 772 million in 2007 versus 593 million in 2006 and 460 million in 2005 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2007 and 2006 were due to the acquisition of properties in 2007 2006 and 2005 which were partially offset by property sales in these years as discussed in the section entitled “funds from operations available to common stockholders” depreciation and amortization is a noncash item that is excluded from our calculation of ffo 

interest expense 

interest expense was 130 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 interest expense increased in 2007 primarily due to higher average outstanding balances which were partially offset by slightly lower interest rates related to our average outstanding borrowings and crest’s larger investment in real estate which contributed to the increase in interest expense included in discontinued operations we issued 550 million of 12year notes in september 2007 and 275 million of 10year notes in september 2006 which contributed to the increase in average outstanding balances and slightly lower average interest rates on our debt 

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

 

 

at february 1 2008 the weighted average interest rate on our notes payable of 147 billion was 628 and the average interest rate on our credit line was 378 there was no outstanding balance on our credit line at february 1 2008 

interest coverage ratio 

our interest coverage ratio for 2007 was 41 times for 2006 was 41 times and for 2005 was 44 times interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated in the following table divided by interest expense including interest recorded to discontinued operations we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

the following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flow to our interest coverage amount dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

fixed charge coverage ratio 

our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2007 was 31 times for 2006 was 34 times and for 2005 was 36 times fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures or information presented in exhibit 121 to this annual report

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased by 52 million to 227 million in 2007 versus 175 million in 2006 general and administrative expenses were 154 million in 2005 in 2007 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 77 as compared to 73 in 2006 and 79 in 2005 general and administrative expenses increased in 2007 primarily due to increases in employee and director compensation costs during 2007 we added two new directors to our board of directors we anticipate that in 2008 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue will be flat or decrease 

in february 2008 we had 75 permanent employees as compared to 70 permanent employees in february 2007 as our property portfolio has grown and continues to grow we have increased and anticipate that we will continue to gradually increase the level of our staffing 

property expenses 

property expenses are broken down into costs associated with nonnet leased multitenant properties unleased singletenant properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to the multitenant and unleased singletenant properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal bad debt expense property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2007 48 properties were available for lease as compared to 26 at december 31 2006 and 25 at december 31 2005 

property expenses were 35 million in 2007 33 million in 2006 and 39 million in 2005 property expenses include provisions for impairment of 138000 recorded for one property in 2007 and 151000 recorded for two properties in 2005 

income taxes 

income taxes were 14 million in 2007 as compared to 747000 in 2006 and 813000 in 2005 these amounts are for city and state income taxes paid by realty income the increase in 2007 is due primarily to an increase in rental revenue resulting in higher city and state income tax expense and higher state tax rates 

in addition crest incurred state and federal income taxes of 30 million in 2007 as compared to 494000 in 2006 and 943000 in 2005 the increase in crest’s 2007 income taxes over the 2006 and 2005 income taxes is due to higher taxable income primarily attributable to higher rental revenue and higher gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale these amounts are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” on our consolidated statements of income 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in september 2006 we redeemed all of our outstanding 110 million 775 unsecured notes due may 2007 the “2007 notes” the 2007 notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2007 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest of 32 million as well as a makewhole payment of 16 million we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling 16 million related to the makewhole payment associated with the 2007 notes for 2006 the makewhole payment represented approximately 0017 per share 

discontinued operations 

crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties consequently we classify properties acquired by crest as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them the operation of crest’s properties is classified as “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” on our consolidated statements of income 

the following is a summary of crest’s “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale” on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

 

realty income’s operations from properties sold in 2007 2006 and 2005 have been classified as discontinued operations no investment properties were classified as held for sale at december 31 2007 the following is a summary of realty income’s “income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment” on our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

 

 

the following is a summary of our total income from discontinued operations dollars in thousands except per share data 

 

 

  

  

crest’s property sales 

in 2007 crest sold 62 properties for 1236 million which resulted in a gain of 123 million for two property sales during 2007 crest provided the buyers partial financing for a total of 38 million of which 619000 was paid in full in november 2007 in 2006 crest sold 13 properties for 224 million which resulted in a gain of 22 million in 2005 crest sold 12 properties for 235 million which resulted in a gain of 33 million in 2005 crest provided a buyer partial financing of 13 million for one property sale which was paid in full in february 2006 crest’s gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are included in discontinued operations 

crest’s property inventory 

at december 31 2007 crest had 562 million invested in 30 properties which are held for sale at december 31 2006 crest’s property inventory totaled 1375 million in 60 properties crest generally carries real estate inventory in excess of 20 million crest generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties it is our belief that at this level of inventory rental revenue will exceed the ongoing operating expenses of crest without any property sales 

gain on sales of investment properties improvements and land by realty income 

in 2007 we sold ten investment properties for 70 million which resulted in a gain of 17 million this gain is included in discontinued operations in addition we sold excess land and improvements from five properties for an aggregate of 44 million which resulted in a gain of 18 million this gain from the land and improvements sales is reported in “other revenue” on our consolidated statements of income because these improvements and excess land were associated with properties that continue to be owned as part of our core operations in 2006 we sold or exchanged 13 investment properties for 107 million which resulted in a gain of 30 million which is included in discontinued operations in 2005 we sold 23 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from two properties for 234 million and recognized a gain on sales of 66 million which is included in discontinued operations except for 18000 that is included in “other revenue” on our consolidated statements of income 

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2007 we classified real estate owned by crest with a carrying amount of 562 million as held for sale on our balance sheet additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest 

in 2007 and 2005 no provisions for impairment were recorded by crest in 2006 provisions for impairment of 12 million were recorded by crest on three properties one of the three properties was sold in 2007 crest’s properties are held for sale and the provisions for impairment recorded in 2006 reduced the carrying costs to the estimated fairmarket value of those properties net of estimated selling costs 

provisions for impairment on realty income investment properties 

in 2007 we recorded a provision for impairment of 134000 on one property which is included in “income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment” on our consolidated statement of income as the property was subsequently sold additionally we recorded a provision for impairment of 138000 on one property in 2007 which is included in property expense on our consolidated statement of income in 2006 we recorded a provision for impairment of 16000 on one property in 2005 we recorded provisions for impairment totaling 186000 on four properties the 2006 and 2005 provisions are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment” except for 151000 in 2005 which is included in property expense on our consolidated statement of income 

preferred stock dividends 

preferred stock cash dividends totaled 243 million in 2007 as compared to 114 million in 2006 and 94 million in 2005 

net income available to common stockholders 

net income available to common stockholders was 1162 million in 2007 an increase of 168 million as compared to 994 million in 2006 net income available to common stockholders in 2005 was 897 million 

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sales of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

during 2007 the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties was 36 million as compared to 30 million during 2006 and 66 million in 2005 crest’s gain recognized from the sale of properties during 2007 was 123 million as compared to 22 million during 2006 and 33 million during 2005 

funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

ffo for 2007 increased by 339 million or 218 to 1897 million as compared to 1558 million in 2006 and 1296 million in 2005 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items 

  

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes noncash items such as depreciation the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance in addition ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

other noncash items and capitalized expenditures 

the following information includes noncash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio these items are not included in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at ffo analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 

 

 

 

 

 

impact of inflation 

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

approximately 974 or 2212 of the 2270 properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

  

 

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes primarily at fixed rates and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december 31 2007 we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and fair values as of december 31 2007 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

expected maturity data 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2007 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates our credit facility interest rate is variable at december 31 2007 our credit facility balance was zero however we intend to borrow funds on our credit facility in the future based on a hypothetical credit facility borrowing of 50 million a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 500000 per year 

  

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accountancy or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act 1934 rules 13a14c and 15d14c that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2007 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting  

internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

 

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

 

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

 

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled internal controlintegrated framework published by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting

changes in internal controls   there have not been any significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

 item 1 business 

  

the company 

  

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust or reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal retail and real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 38 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements primarily 15 to 20years 

  

in addition we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties our portfolio management focus includes 

  

•   contractual rent increases on existing leases 

•   rent increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit and 

•   active management of our property portfolio including releasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties 

  

in acquiring additional properties we adhere to a focused strategy of primarily acquiring properties that are 

  

•   freestanding singletenant retail locations 

•   leased to regional and national retail chains and 

•   leased under longterm netlease agreements 

  

at december 31 2006 we owned a diversified portfolio

we typically acquire retail store properties under longterm leases with retail chain store operators these transactions generally provide capital to owners of retail real estate and retail chains for expansion or other corporate purposes our acquisition and investment activities are concentrated in welldefined target markets and generally focus on retail chains providing goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs 

  

  

our netlease agreements generally 

  

•   are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years 

•   require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses taxes insurance and maintenance and 

•   provide for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level 

  

realty income commenced operations as a reit on august 15 1994 through the merger of 25 public and private real estate limited partnerships with and into the company each of the partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the purpose of acquiring and managing longterm netleased properties

recent developments 

  

acquisitions during 2006 

  

during 2006 realty income and crest invested 7699 million in aggregate in 378 new properties and properties under development these 378 properties are located in 30 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 171 years as described below realty income acquired 322 properties and crest acquired 56 properties 

  

included in the 7699 million is 6567 million invested by realty income in 322 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 86 these 322 properties are located in 30 states are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 167 years and will contain over 33 million leasable square feet the 322 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to 16 different retail chains in the following 11 industries automotive collision services automotive tire services convenience store drug store general merchandise health and fitness home improvement motor vehicle dealership private education restaurant and theater also included in the 7699 million is 1132 million invested by crest in 56 new retail properties 

  

  

at december 31 2006 realty income had invested 159 million in four properties that were leased and being developed by the tenant with development costs funded by realty income rent on these properties is scheduled to begin at various times during 2007 at december 31 2006 we had outstanding commitments to pay estimated unfunded development costs totaling approximately 164 million 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above

crest property sales 

  

during 2006 crest sold 13 properties from its inventory for an aggregate of 224 million which resulted in a gain of 22 million crest’s gains are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

crest property inventory 

  

crest’s property inventory at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 totaled 1375 million and 457 million respectively and is included in “real estate held for sale net” on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

  

we continue our 37year policy of paying distributions monthly to our common stockholders monthly distributions per share were increased in april 2006 by 0000625 to 0116875 in july 2006 by 0000625 to 01175 in september 2006 by 000775 to 012525 in october 2006 by 0000625 to 0125875 and in january 2007 by 0000625 to 01265 the increase in january 2007 was our 37th consecutive quarterly increase and the 42nd increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the new york stock exchange or nyse in 1994 in 2006 we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of 011625 three in the amount of 0116875 two in the amount of 01175 one in the amount of 012525 and three in the amount of 0125875 totaling 143725 in december 2006 january 2007 and february 2007 we declared distributions of 01265 per share which were paid on january 16 2007 and february 15 2007 and will be paid on march 15 2007 respectively 

  

  

the monthly distribution of 01265 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1518 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 52 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2909 on february 13 2007 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what the actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

  

distribution policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to our common stockholders and class d and class e preferred stockholders if and when declared by our board of directors 

  

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains in 2006 our cash distributions totaled 1391 million or approximately 1133 of our estimated reit taxable income of 1228 million our estimated reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes our 2006 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 1297 million representing 832 of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of 1558 million 

  

the class d preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 184375 per annum per share the class e preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 675 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 16875 per annum per share 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the tax code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced tax rate the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” has generally been reduced to 15 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2002 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends except to the extent the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year or as discussed above dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends” distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in the stock distributions above that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain approximately 99 of the distributions to our common stockholders made or deemed to have been made in 2006 were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital 

  

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

investment philosophy 

  

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of retail properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm leases coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property expenses generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

investment strategy 

  

in identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is generally on providing capital to retail chain owners and operators by acquiring then leasing back retail store locations we categorize retail tenants as 1 venture market 2 middle market and 3 upper market venture companies typically offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and 50 retail locations middle market retail chains typically have 50 to 500 retail locations operations in more than one geographic region have been successful through one or more economic cycles and have a proven replicable concept the upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500 or more locations operating nationally in a proven mature retail concept upper market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital 

  

realty income primarily focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because 

  

•   they generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that can adversely affect venture retailers 

•   they typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing options 

•   they generally have provided us with attractive riskadjusted returns over time since their financial strength has in many cases tended to improve as their businesses have matured 

•   their relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a greater number of stores and 

•   middle market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number of locations are closed due to underperformance 

  

we also focus on and have selectively made investments in properties of upper market retail chains we believe upper market retail chains can be attractive for investment because 

  

•   they typically are of a higher credit quality 

•   they usually are larger public and private retailers with more commonly recognized brand names 

•   they utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10000 to 50000 square feet and 

•   they are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger transaction sizes 

  

while our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to middle and upper market retail chains we also selectively seek investment opportunities with venture market retail chains periodically venture market opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices to meet our stringent investment standards however venture retail companies must have a welldefined retailing concept and strong financial prospects these opportunities are examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in making investments in this area 

  

historically our investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2006 approximately 809 of our rental revenue was derived from retailers with a service component in their business furthermore we believe these serviceoriented businesses would be 

  

  

difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internet businesses 

  

credit strategy 

  

we generally provide saleleaseback financing to less than investment grade retail chains we typically acquire and lease back properties to regional and national retail chains and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers since 1970 our overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 986 and the occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 975 

  

we believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its retail business we believe the risk of default on a retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers’ individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

  

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

  

•   industry company market conditions and credit profile 

•   location profitability if profitability data is available and 

•   overall real estate characteristics including value and comparative rental rates 

  

the typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more retail locations generally the properties 

  

•   are located in highly visible areas 

•   have easy access to major thoroughfares and 

•   have attractive demographics 

  

acquisition strategy 

  

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national chains are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale advertising and the selection of prime retail locations we execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain store owners and operators doing business in a variety of industries by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting real estate for potential investment we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics 

  

•   freestanding commerciallyzoned property with a single tenant 

•   properties that are important retail locations for regional and national retail chains 

•   properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of their tenants with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares and 

•   properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm netlease agreements offering both current income and the potential for rent increases 

  

portfolio management strategy 

  

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and 

  

  

locations in which we have invested the portfolio is regularly analyzed with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality our executives review industry research tenant research property due diligence and significant portfolio management activities this monitoring typically includes regular review and analysis of 

  

•   the performance of various retail industries and 

•   the operation management business planning and financial condition of the tenants 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2006 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 138 million as held for sale which includes 1375 million in properties owned by crest additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

  

universal shelf registration 

  

in april 2006 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which is effective for a term of three years in accordance with the sec rules the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock preferred stock debt securities or any combination of such securities realty income may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered the specifics of any future offerings along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of any offering as such there is no specific limit to the dollar amount of new securities that can be issued under this new shelf registration before it expires in april 2009 the common stock issued in september 2006 october 2006 and november 2006 the 2016 notes issued in september 2006 and the class e preferred stock issued in december 2006 were issued pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement 

  

conservative capital structure 

  

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 13 2007 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 920 million or approximately 219 of our total market capitalization of 421 billion we calculate our total market capitalization at february 13 2007 as the sum of 

  

•   shares of our common stock outstanding of 101000536 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 2909 per share or 294 billion 

•   aggregate liquidation value of the class d preferred stock of 1275 million 

•   aggregate liquidation value of the class e preferred stock of 220 million and 

•   outstanding notes of 920 million 

  

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

we have a 300 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2008 realty income’s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing under the credit facility at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 65 basis points with a facility fee of 15 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 80 basis points over libor at february 13 2007 we had borrowing capacity of 300 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding balance 

  

  

the credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility by up to 100 million to a total borrowing capacity of 400 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks of our credit facility 

  

we use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions when outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a certain level generally in the range of 100 million to 200 million and capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock convertible preferred stock debt securities or convertible debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from fitch ratings moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings group currently fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes moody’s and standard  poor’s ratings have “positive” outlooks and fitch has a “stable” outlook 

  

we have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa3 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our preferred stock moody’s and standard  poor’s ratings have “positive” outlooks and fitch has a “stable” outlook 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that any such rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances warrant moreover a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt securities preferred stock or common stock 

  

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

  

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

  

realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

  

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatory redeemable preferred stock our financial position and results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standards no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

competitive strategy 

  

we believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

  

•   size and type of investment properties   we believe smaller 500000 to 10000000 netleased retail properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in today’s real estate environment due to the complexities of acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets we believe these types of properties have not experienced significant institutional ownership interest or the corresponding yield reduction experienced by larger incomeproducing properties we believe the less intensive daytoday property management required by netlease agreements coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of smaller properties is an effective investment strategy the tenants of our freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs in order to grow and 

  

  

expand they generally need capital since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back under a netlease arrangement allows the retail chain to free up capital 

  

•   investment in new retail industries   though we specialize in singletenant properties we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of retail industries we believe diversification will allow us to invest in retail industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find attractive these characteristics include but are not limited to retail industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national chain store operators can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations as well as capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base 

  

•   diversification   diversification of the portfolio by retail industry type tenant and geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for our stockholders therefore further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective at december 31 2006 our retail property portfolio consisted of 1955 properties located in 48 states leased to 103 retail chains doing business in 29 industry segments each of the 29 industry segments represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for no more than 178 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2006 

  

•   management specialization   we believe that our management’s specialization in singletenant retail properties operated under netlease agreements is important to meeting our objectives we plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train highquality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership finance and management 

  

•   technology   we intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to efficiently and economically carry out our operations we maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio’s performance and actively manage our investments we believe that technology and informationbased systems will play an increasingly important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants 

  

properties 

  

at december 31 2006 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

•   of 1955 retail properties 

•   with an occupancy rate of 987 or 1929 properties occupied of the 1955 properties in the portfolio 

•   leased to 103 different retail chains doing business in 29 separate retail industries 

•   located in 48 states 

•   with over 167 million square feet of leasable space and 

•   with an average leasable retail space per property of approximately 8600 square feet 

  

in addition to our real estate portfolio at december 31 2006 our subsidiary crest had invested 1375 million in 60 properties located in 15 states these properties are classified as held for sale 

  

at december 31 2006 1923 or 984 of our 1955 retail properties were leased under netlease agreements net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level 

  

our netleased retail properties primarily are leased to regional and national retail chain store operators most buildings are singlestory structures with adequate parking on site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods the properties tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic counts adequate access and proximity to a sufficient population base to constitute a suitable market or trade area for the retailer’s business

description of leasing structure 

  

at december 31 2006 1923 single tenant and certain other retail properties or 984 of our 1955 properties were net leased in most cases the leases 

  

•   are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years 

•   require the tenants to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses taxes insurance and maintenance and 

•   provide for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level where leases provide for rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index generally these increases become part of the new permanent base rent where leases provide for percentage rent this additional rent is typically payable only if the tenants’ gross sales for a given period usually one year exceed a specified level and is then typically calculated as a percentage of only the amount of gross sales in excess of that level 

  

matters pertaining to certain properties and tenants 

  

of the 26 properties available for lease or sale at december 31 2006 all are singletenant properties except one at december 31 2006 16 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2006 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

certain properties under development 

  

of the 322 properties realty income acquired in 2006 all were occupied at december 31 2006 except for four properties that were leased and being developed in the case of development properties we either enter into an agreement with a retail chain where the retailer retains a contractor to construct the building and we fund the costs of that development or we fund a developer who constructs the building in either case there is an executed lease with a retail tenant at the time of the land purchase with a fixed rent commencement date and there is a requirement to complete the construction in a timely basis and within a specific budget typically within eight months after we purchase the land the tenant or developer generally is required to pay construction cost overruns to the extent that they exceed the construction budget by more than a predetermined amount we also enter into a lease with the tenant at the time we purchase the land which generally requires the tenant to begin paying base rent when the store opens for business the base rent is calculated by multiplying a predetermined capitalization rate by our total investment in the property including the land cost for the property construction costs and capitalized interest in 2006 realty income acquired 15 development properties crest did not acquire any development property in 2006 both realty income and crest will continue to pursue development opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

as used under this caption “risk factors” references to our capital stock include our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock and references to our stockholders include holders of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock in each case unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires 

  

in order to grow w e need to continue to acquire investment properties which may be subject to competitive pressures 

  

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

  

•   businesses 

•   individuals 

•   fiduciary accounts and plans and 

•   other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

  

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

  

our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent may be affected by competition within their industries from other operators 

  

the tenants leasing our properties can face significant competition from other operators this competition may adversely impact 

  

•   that portion if any of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a tenant’s revenues and 

•   the tenants’ results of operations or financial condition 

  

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

  

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

•   our knowledge of the contamination 

•   the timing of the contamination 

•   the cause of the contamination or 

•   the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental problems of which we are unaware associated with our properties in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by the company in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

compliance we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms 

  

insurance and indemnity in june 2005 we entered into a sevenyear environmental insurance policy on our property portfolio which replaced the previous fiveyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our current policy are 10 million per occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 40000 self insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all

  

  

our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located 

  

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

  

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 

  

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

  

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualifications as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

•   we would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

•   we would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed to our stockholders 

•   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

•   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

•   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax our subsidiary crest is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property 

  

distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

  

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of our common stock 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing 

  

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 300 million acquisition credit facility at february 13 2007 we had no borrowings outstanding under our 300 million acquisition credit facility and a total of 920 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our 300 million credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due in addition our 300 million credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us on our common stock and preferred stock in the event of deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition and our 300 million credit facility provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal of or interest on borrowings there under when due subject to any applicable grace period we and our subsidiaries may not pay any dividends on our capital stock including our outstanding common and preferred stock if this were to occur it would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the value of our debt securities 

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock including 

  

•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions

•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements

•   requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and general corporate requirements

•   limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and

•   putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

  

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time including 

  

•   prevailing interest rates increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and our debt securities

•   the market for similar securities issued by reits

•   general economic and financial market conditions

•   the financial condition performance and prospects of us and our competitors

•   changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us our competitors or our industry

•   changes in our credit ratings and

•   actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results

  

as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

  

we are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

•   adverse changes in general or local economic conditions 

•   changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties 

•   changes in interest rates and operating expenses 

•   competition for tenants 

•   changes in market rental rates 

•   inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases 

•   renewal of leases at lower rental rates 

•   inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship including bankruptcy 

•   changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate 

•   uninsured property liability 

•   property damage or casualty losses 

•   unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws 

•   acts of terrorism and war and 

•   acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

  

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

  

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between 1000000 and 10000000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which it operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by 

  

  

the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operation 

  

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

  

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

  

matters pertaining to certain properties and tenants 

  

twentysix of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31 2006 of which all but one were singletenant properties as of february 13 2007 transactions to lease or sell four of the 26 properties available for lease at december 31 2006 were underway or completed at december 31 2006 16 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations 

  

for 2006 our tenants in the convenience store restaurant and child care industries accounted for approximately 161 119 and 103 respectively of our rental revenue a downturn in any of these industries whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect tenants in these industries which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for 2006 

  

in addition a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket retail chains that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail chains and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional or national economy 

  

  

we depend on key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the retail netlease industry 

  

terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

  

terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants 

  

such events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust or reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal retail research real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 38 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements primarily 15 to 20years

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash reserves 

  

realty income is organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 106 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility 

  

300 million acquisition credit facility 

  

we have a 300 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2008 realty income’s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing under the credit facility at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 65 basis points with a facility fee of 15 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 80 basis points over libor at february 13 2007 we had borrowing capacity of 300 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding balance 

  

  

the credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility by up to 100 million to a total borrowing capacity of 400 million any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks of our credit facility

conservative capital structure 

  

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 13 2007 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 920 million or approximately 219 of our total market capitalization of 421 billion we define our total market capitalization at february 13 2007 as the sum of 

  

•   shares of our common stock outstanding of 101000536 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 2909 per share or 294 billion

•   aggregate liquidation value of the class d preferred stock of 1275 million

•   aggregate liquidation value of the class e preferred stock of 220 million and

•   outstanding notes of 920 million

  

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above

increases in monthly cash distributions to common stockholders 

  

we continue our 37year policy of paying distributions monthly to our common stockholders monthly distributions per share were increased in april 2006 by 0000625 to 0116875 in july 2006 by 0000625 to 01175 in september 2006 by 000775 to 012525 in october 2006 by 0000625 to 0125875 and in january 2007 by 0000625 to 01265 the increase in january 2007 was our 37th consecutive quarterly increase and the 42nd increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2006 we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of 011625 three in the amount of 0116875 two in the amount of 01175 one in the amount of 012525 and three in the amount of 0125875 totaling 143725 in december 2006 january 2007 and february 2007 we declared distributions of 01265 per share which were paid on january 16 2007 and february 15 2007 and will be paid on march 15 2007 respectively 

  

the monthly distribution of 01265 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1518 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 52 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2909 on february 13 2007 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what the actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

  

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting polices one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation of buildings and improvements is generally computed using the straight–line method over an estimated useful life 

  

  

of 25 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life no depreciation has been recorded on crest’s properties because they are held for sale 

  

another significant judgment must be made as to if and when impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable generally a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

  

rental revenue 

  

rental revenue was 2381 million for 2006 versus 1957 million for 2005 an increase of 424 million or 217 rental revenue was 172 million in 2004 the increase in rental revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to 

  

•   the 322 retail properties acquired by realty income in 2006 which generated 157 million of rent in 2006

•   the 135 retail properties acquired by realty income in 2005 which generated 335 million of rent in 2006 compared to 121 million in 2005 an increase of 214 million

•   same store rents generated on 1421 properties leased during the entire years of 2006 and 2005 increased by 13 million or 07 to 1753 million from 1740 million

•   an increase in straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to rent of 155000 in 2006 as compared to 2005 and

•   an increase of 40 million relating to the aggregate of i development properties acquired before 2005 that started paying rent in 2005 ii properties that were vacant during part of 2006 or 2005 and iii lease termination settlements these items totaled 97 million in aggregate in 2006 compared to 57 million in 2005

  

of the 1955 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2006 1948 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining seven are multitenant properties of the 1948 singletenant properties 1923 or 987 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 129 years at december 31 2006 of our 1923 leased singletenant properties 1713 or 891 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

•   primarily base rent increases tied to a consumer price index

•   fixed increases

•   to a lesser degree overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales or

•   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 11 million in 2006 12 million in 2005 and 13 million in 2004 percentage rent in 2006 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2007 

  

our portfolio of retail real estate leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases continues to perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2006 our portfolio of 1955 retail properties was 987 leased with 26 properties available for lease one of which is a multitenant property 

  

as of february 13 2007 transactions to lease or sell four of the 26 properties available for lease at december 31 2006 were underway or completed we anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several 

  

  

months although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this period it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 3 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 104 million higher in 2006 than in 2005 interest expense increased in 2006 primarily due to higher average outstanding balances which was partially offset by slightly lower interest rates related to our average outstanding borrowings we issued 275 million of 10year notes in september 2006 175 million of 12year notes in september 2005 and 100 million of 30year bonds in march 2005 which contributed to the increase in average outstanding balances and slightly lower average interest rates on our debt 

  

the following is a summary of the components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

   

at february 13 2007 the weighted average interest rate on our notes payable of 920 million was 599 and the average interest rate on our credit line was 597 there was no balance on our credit line at february 13 2007 

  

interest coverage ratio 

  

our interest coverage ratio for 2006 was 41 times for 2005 was 44 times and for 2004 was 50 times interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated in the following table divided by interest expense including interest recorded to discontinued operations we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

  

  

the following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to our interest coverage amount dollars in thousands 

  

   

1   crest activities

2   the 2005 amount includes intangibles recorded in connection with acquisitions of real estate acquired for resale

3   includes interest expense recorded to “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest”

  

fixed charge coverage ratio 

  

our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2006 was 34 times for 2005 was 36 times and for 2004 was 39 times fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

interest coverage amount divided by interest expense plus preferred stock dividends dollars in thousands 

  

   

1 excludes the class b and class c preferred stock noncash charge of 3774 in 2004 for excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

2 includes interest expense recorded to “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization was 595 million in 2006 versus 462 million in 2005 and 397 million in 2004 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2006 and 2005 were due to the acquisition of properties in 2006 2005 and 2004 which were partially offset by property sales during these years 

  

  

general and administrative expenses 

  

general and administrative expenses increased by 21 million to 175 million in 2006 versus 154 million in 2005 general and administrative expenses were 131 million in 2004 in 2006 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 73 as compared to 79 in 2005 and 76 in 2004 general and administrative expenses increased in total dollars primarily due to increases in payroll and employee benefit costs 

  

as our property portfolio has grown and continues to grow we have increased and anticipate that we will continue to gradually increase the level of our staffing we expect general and administrative expenses to moderately increase due to costs attributable to payroll staffing costs and corporate governance 

  

in february 2007 we had 70 permanent employees as compared to february 2006 when we had 69 permanent employees and four temporary employees 

  

property expenses 

  

property expenses are broken down into costs associated with nonnet leased multitenant properties unleased singletenant properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to the multitenant and unleased singletenant properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal bad debt expense property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2006 26 properties were available for lease as compared to 25 at december 31 2005 and 32 at december 31 2004 

  

property expenses were 33 million in 2006 37 million in 2005 and 31 million in 2004 the 392000 decrease in property expenses in 2006 is primarily attributable to a decrease in costs associated with bad debt expense legal fees and property taxes 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes were 747000 in 2006 as compared to 813000 in 2005 and 699000 in 2004 these amounts are for city and state income taxes paid by realty income 

  

in addition crest incurred state and federal income taxes of 494000 in 2006 as compared to 943000 in 2005 and 35 million in 2004 the decrease in crest’s 2006 income taxes over the 2005 and 2004 income taxes are due to lower taxable income primarily attributable to lower gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale these amounts are included in “income from discontinued operations from real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt 

  

in september 2006 we redeemed all of our outstanding 110 million 7¾ unsecured notes due may 2007 the 2007 notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of 32 million and a makewhole payment of 16 million we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling 16 million related to the makewhole payment associated with the 2007 notes for 2006 the makewhole payment represented approximately 0017 per share 

  

discontinued operations 

  

crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties consequently we classify properties acquired by crest as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them the operation of crest’s properties is classified as “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

  

the following is a summary of crest’s “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale” for the years 2006 2005 and 2004 dollars in thousands except per share data 

  

   

realty income’s operations from one property listed as held for sale at december 31 2006 plus properties sold in 2006 2005 and 2004 have been classified as discontinued operations the following is a summary of our discontinued operations from real estate held for investment for the years 2006 2005 and 2004 dollars in thousands except per share data 

  

   

the following is a summary of our total discontinued operations for the years 2006 2005 and 2004 dollars in thousands except per share data 

  

   

the above per share amounts have each been calculated independently 

  

gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale by crest 

  

in 2006 crest sold 13 properties for 224 million which resulted in a gain of 22 million in 2005 crest sold 12 properties for 235 million which resulted in a gain of 33 million in 2004 crest sold 51 properties for 75 million which resulted in a gain of 103 million crest’s gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

  

at december 31 2006 crest had 1375 million invested in 60 properties which are held for sale crest generally carries a real estate inventory in excess of 20 million crest generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties it is our belief that at this level of inventory rental revenue will exceed the ongoing operating expenses of crest without any property sales 

  

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

  

in 2006 we sold or exchanged 13 investment properties for 107 million which resulted in a gain of 30 million which is included in discontinued operations in 2005 we sold 23 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from two properties for 234 million and recognized a gain on sales of 66 million which is included in discontinued operations except for 18000 that is included in other revenue in 2004 we sold or exchanged 43 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from four properties for a total of 354 million and recognized a gain of 127 million which is included in discontinued operations except for 185000 that is included in other revenue 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2006 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 138 million as held for sale on our balance sheet which includes properties owned by crest additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 10 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

  

provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest 

  

provisions for impairment of 12 million were recorded by crest on three properties in 2006 no provisions for impairment were recorded by crest in 2005 and 2004 crest’s properties are held for sale and the provisions for impairment recorded in 2006 reduced the carrying costs to the estimated fairmarket value of those properties net of estimated selling costs 

  

provisions for impairment on realty income investment properties 

  

in 2006 a provision for impairment of 16000 was recorded on one property in 2005 we recorded provisions for impairment totaling 186000 on four properties in 2004 we recorded provisions for impairment totaling 24 million on six properties these provisions are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment” except for 151000 in 2005 and 716000 in 2004 which are included in “provisions for impairment” 

  

preferred stock cash dividends and redemption charge 

  

preferred stock cash dividends totaled 114 million in 2006 as compared to 94 million in 2005 and 95 million in 2004 

  

when we redeemed our class b preferred stock in june 2004 and our class c preferred stock in july 2004 we incurred noncash charges of 24 million and 14 million respectively for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value these noncash charges represent the class b and class c preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders when the shares were redeemed these noncash charges equated to 005 per common share in 2004 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

  

net income available to common stockholders was 994 million in 2006 an increase of 97 million as compared to 897 million in 2005 net income available to common stockholders in 2004 was 902 million 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

  

during 2006 the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties was 30 million as compared to 66 million during 2005 and 127 million in 2004 crest’s gain recognized from the sale of properties during 2006 was 22 million as compared to 33 million during 2005 and 103 million during 2004 

  

funds from operations 

available to common stockholders ffo 

  

ffo for 2006 increased by 262 million or 202 to 1558 million as compared to 1296 million in 2005 and 1182 million in 2004 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure to ffo also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the years ended december 31 dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets reduced by gains on sales of investment property and extraordinary items 

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes noncash items such as depreciation the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

  

presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund 

  

  

cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of realty income’s performance in addition ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

  

other noncash items and capitalized expenditures 

  

the following information includes noncash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio these items are not included in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at ffo analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 

  

   

1   the settlements on the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate risk prevention strategy that was used by the company in 1997 and 1998 which correlated to pending issuances of senior note securities we have not employed this strategy since 1998

2   amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in may 1997 october 1998 january 1999 march 2003 november 2003 march 2005 september 2005 and september 2006 these costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included

3   a negative amount indicates that our straightline rent was greater than our actual cash rent collected a positive amount indicates that our straightline rent was less than our actual cash rent collected

4   represents the class b and class c preferred stock noncash charges for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value

  

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

approximately 984 or 1923 of the 1955 properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

impact of accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements statement no 157 sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fairvalue measurements statement no 157 becomes effective for us at the beginning of 2008 the impact of adopting statement no 157 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 interpretation no 48 applies to all tax positions accounted for under statement 109 including tax positions acquired in a business combination interpretation 48 is effective for us at the beginning of 2007 the impact of adopting interpretation no 48 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes primarily at fixed rates and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december 31 2006 we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates and fair values as of december 31 2006 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  

expected maturity data as of december 31 2006 

  

   

1   100 million matures in november 2008

2   the credit facility expires in october 2008 the credit facility balance as of december 31 2006 and february 13 2007 was zero

3   20 million matures in january 2009

4   100 million matures in march 2013 150 million matures in november 2015 275 million matures in september 2016 175 million matures in september 2017 and 100 million matures in march 2035

5   we base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december 31 2006 on the closing market price or indicative price per each note

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2006 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates our credit facility interest rate is variable at december 31 2006 our credit facility balance was zero however we intend to borrow funds on our credit facility in the future based on a hypothetical credit facility borrowing of 50 million a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 500000 per year 

  

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accountancy or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act 1934 rules 13a14c and 15d14c that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control—integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations “coso” of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

submitted on february 20 2007 by 

  

thomas a lewis chief executive officer and vice chairman 

paul m meurer chief financial office executive vice president and treasurer 

  

  

changes in internal controls there have not been any significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation there were no material weaknesses and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

our acquisition of additional properties adheres to a focused strategy of primarily acquiring properties that are 

  

•   freestanding singletenant retail locations 

•   leased to regional and national retail chains and 

•   leased under longterm netlease agreements 

  

at december 31 2005 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

•   of 1646 retail properties

our netlease agreements generally 

  

•   are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years 

•   require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses taxes insurance and maintenance and 

  

  

•   provide for future rent increases typically subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level

acquisitions during 2005 

  

during 2005 realty income and crest net invested in aggregate 4866 million in 156 new properties and properties under development these 156 properties are located in 30 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 158 years as described below realty income acquired 135 properties and crest net acquired 21 properties 

  

included in the 4866 million is 4307 million invested by realty income in 135 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 84 these 135 properties are located in 28 states are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 156 years and will contain over 17 million leasable square feet the 135 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to 13 different retail chains in the convenience store drug store financial services health and fitness motor vehicle dealership restaurant and theater industries 

  

included in the 4864 million is 559 million invested by crest net in 21 new retail properties and properties under development 

  

of the 4307 million realty income invested in real estate during 2005 439 million was invested in 10 properties that were leased and under contract for development by the tenant at december 31 2005 with development costs funded by realty income rent on these properties is scheduled to begin at various times during 2006 at december 31 2005 we also had committed to pay estimated unfunded development costs totaling 422 million 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

investments in existing properties 

  

in 2005 we capitalized costs of 16 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 570000 for releasing costs and 10 million for building improvements 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

  

net income available to common stockholders was 897 million in 2005 versus 902 million in 2004 a decrease of 452000 on a diluted per common share basis net income was 112 per share in 2005 as compared to 115 per share in 2004 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of investment properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2005 was 66 million as compared to 127 million during 2004 

  

  

funds from operations ffo

see our discussion of ffo in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo

during 2005 crest net sold 12 properties from its inventory for 235 million which resulted in a gain of 33 million 

  

crest net’s property inventory

increases in monthly cash distributions to common stockholders 

  

we continue our 36year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased in april 2005 by 0000625 to 0110625 in july 2005 by 0000625 to 011125 in september 2005 by 000375 to 0115 in october 2005 by 0000625 to 0115625 and in january 2006 by 000625 to 011625 the increase in january 2006 was our 33rd consecutive quarterly increase and the 37th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2005 we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of 011 three in the amount of 0110625 two in the amount of 011125 one in the amount of 0115 and three in the amount of 0115625 totaling 134625 in december 2005 january 2006 and february 2006 we declared distributions of 011625 per share which were paid on january 17 2006 february 15 2006 and will be paid on march 15 2006 respectively 

  

the monthly distribution of 011625 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1395 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 61 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2278 on february 10 2006 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what the actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

  

distribution policy 

  

distributions are paid monthly to our common stockholders and class d preferred stockholders if and when declared by our board of directors the class d preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 184375 per annum per share 

  

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains in 2005 our cash distributions totaled 1180 million or approximately 1132 of our estimated reit taxable income of 1042 million our estimated reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes our 2005 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 1086 million representing 838 of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of 1296 million 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that 

  

  

could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” has generally been reduced to 15 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2002 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends except to the extent the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest net to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year or as discussed above dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends” distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in the stock distributions above that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain approximately 101 of the distributions made or deemed to have been made in 2005 to our common stockholders were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital 

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

investment philosophy 

  

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of retail properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income under a netlease agreement the tenant agrees to pay monthly rent and property operating expenses taxes maintenance and insurance plus typically future rent increases generally subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm leases coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property expenses generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

investment strategy 

  

in identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is generally on providing capital to retail chain owners and operators by acquiring then leasing back retail store locations we categorize retail tenants as 1 venture market 2 middle market and 3 upper market venture companies typically offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and 50 retail locations middle market retail chains typically have 50 to 500 retail locations operations in more than one geographic region have been successful through one or more economic cycles and have a proven replicable concept the upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500 or more locations operating nationally in a proven mature retail concept upper market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital 

  

realty income primarily focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because 

  

•   they generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that can adversely affect venture retailers 

•   they typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing options 

•   they generally have provided us with attractive riskadjusted returns over time since their financial strength has in many cases tended to improve as their businesses have matured 

•   their relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a greater number of stores and 

•   middle market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number of locations are closed due to underperformance 

  

  

we also focus on and have selectively made investments in properties of upper market retail chains we believe upper market retail chains can be attractive for investment because 

  

•   they typically are of a higher credit quality 

•   they usually are larger public and private retailers with more commonly recognized brand names 

•   they utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10000 to 50000 square feet and 

•   they are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger transaction sizes 

  

while our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to middle and upper market retail chains we also selectively seek investment opportunities with venture market retail chains periodically venture market opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices to meet our stringent investment standards however venture retail companies must have a welldefined retailing concept and strong financial prospects these opportunities are examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in making investments in this area 

  

historically our investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2005 approximately 812 of our rental revenue was derived from retailers with a service component in their business furthermore we believe these serviceoriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internet businesses 

  

credit strategy 

  

we generally provide saleleaseback financing to less than investment grade retail chains we typically acquire and lease back properties to regional and national retail chains and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers since 1970 our overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 985 and the occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 975 

  

we believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its retail business we believe the risk of default on a retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers’ individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

  

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

  

•   industry company market conditions and credit profile 

•   location profitability if profitability data is available and 

•   overall real estate characteristics including value and comparative rental rates 

  

the typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more retail locations generally the properties 

  

•   are located in highly visible areas 

•   have easy access to major thoroughfares and 

•   have attractive demographics 

  

  

acquisition strategy 

  

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national chains are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale advertising and the selection of prime retail locations we execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain store owners and operators doing business in a variety of industries by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting real estate for potential investment we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics 

  

•   freestanding commerciallyzoned property with a single tenant 

•   properties that are important retail locations for regional and national retail chains 

•   properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of their tenants with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares and 

•   properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm netlease agreements offering both current income and the potential for rent increases 

  

portfolio management strategy 

  

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested the portfolio is regularly analyzed with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality our executives review industry research tenant research property due diligence and significant portfolio management activities this monitoring typically includes regular review and analysis of 

  

•   the performance of various retail industries and 

•   the operation management business planning and financial condition of the tenants 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2005 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 471 million as held for sale which includes 455 million in properties owned by crest net in addition 219000 invested by crest net in real estate is included in other assets and was classified as intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 141 business combinations  additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 15 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

  

conservative capital structure 

  

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 10 2006 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 8866 million or approximately 303 of our total market capitalization of 292 billion we calculate our total market capitalization at february 10 2006 as the sum of 

  

•   shares of our common stock outstanding of 83880873 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 2278 per share or 191 billion 

•   aggregate liquidation value of the class d preferred stock of 1275 million 

•   outstanding borrowings of 1316 million on our credit facility and 

•   outstanding notes of 7550 million 

  

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be invested into additional properties on an accretive basis in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility 

  

  

or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

we have a 300 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2008 at february 10 2006 the outstanding balance on the acquisition credit facility was 1316 million with an effective interest rate of approximately 52 a commitment fee of 015 per annum accrues on the total 300 million credit commitment of the credit facility the credit facility has been and is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains under longterm netlease agreements the credit facility has also been used to provide capital to subsidiaries for the purpose of funding the acquisition of properties we regularly evaluate our credit facility and may seek to extend renew or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

we use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions when outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a certain level generally in the range of 100 million to 200 million and capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock convertible preferred stock debt securities or convertible debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from fitch ratings moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings group currently fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes moody’s rating has a “positive” outlook and the other ratings have a “stable” outlook 

  

we have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa3 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our preferred stock moody’s rating has a “positive” outlook and the other ratings have a “stable” outlook 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

  

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

  

realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

  

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatory redeemable preferred stock our financial position and results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standards no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

competitive strategy 

  

we believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

  

•   size and type of investment properties   we believe smaller 500000 to 10000000 netleased retail properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in today’s real estate environment due to the complexities of acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets we believe these types of properties have not experienced significant institutional ownership interest or the corresponding yield reduction experienced by larger incomeproducing properties we believe the less intensive daytoday 

  

  

property management required by netlease agreements coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of smaller properties is an effective investment strategy the tenants of our freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs in order to grow and expand they generally need capital since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back under a netlease arrangement allows the retail chain to free up capital 

  

•   investment in new retail industries   though we specialize in singletenant properties we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of retail industries we believe diversification will allow us to invest in retail industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find attractive these characteristics include but are not limited to retail industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national chain store operators can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations as well as capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base 

  

•   diversification   diversification of the portfolio by retail industry type tenant and geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for our stockholders therefore further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective at december 31 2005 our retail property portfolio consisted of 1646 properties located in 48 states leased to 101 retail chains doing business in 29 industry segments each of the 29 industry segments represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for no more than 178 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2005 

  

•   management specialization   we believe that our management’s specialization in singletenant retail properties operated under netlease agreements is important to meeting our objectives we plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train highquality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership finance and management 

  

•   technology   we intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to efficiently and economically carry out our operations we maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio’s performance and actively manage our investments we believe that technology and informationbased systems will play an increasingly important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants 

  

properties 

  

at december 31 2005 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

•   of 1646 retail properties 

•   with an occupancy rate of 985 or 1621 properties occupied of the 1646 properties in the portfolio 

•   leased to 101 different retail chains doing business in 29 separate retail industries 

•   located in 48 states 

•   with over 134 million square feet of leasable space and 

•   with an average leasable retail space of 8200 square feet 

  

in addition to our real estate portfolio at december 31 2005 our subsidiary crest net had invested 457 million in a portfolio of 17 properties located in nine states these properties are classified as held for sale 

  

at december 31 2005 1617 or 982 of our 1646 retail properties were owned under netlease agreements net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases generally subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or  to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level 

  

  

our netleased retail properties primarily are leased to regional and national retail chain store operators most buildings are singlestory structures with adequate parking on site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods the properties tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic counts and adequate access and proximity to a sufficient population base constituting a suitable market or trade area for the retailer’s business

description of leasing structure 

  

at december 31 2005 1617 single tenant and certain other retail properties or 982 of our 1646 properties were net leased in most cases the leases 

  

•   are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years 

•   require the tenants to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses taxes insurance and maintenance and 

•   provide for future rent increases typically subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent based upon the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level where leases provide for rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index generally these increases become part of the new permanent base rent where leases provide for percentage rent this additional rent is typically payable only if the tenants’ gross sales for a given period usually one year exceed a specified level and is then typically calculated as a percentage of only the amount of gross sales in excess of that level 

  

matters pertaining to certain properties and tenants 

  

of the 25 properties available for lease or sale at december 31 2005 all but one are singletenant properties at december 31 2005 17 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations during 2005 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue 

  

certain properties under development 

  

of the 135 properties realty income acquired in 2005 all were occupied at december 31 2005 except for 10 properties that were leased and being developed in the case of development properties we either enter into an agreement with a retail chain where the retailer retains a contractor to construct the improvements and we fund the costs of that development or we fund a developer who constructs the improvements in either case there is an executed lease with a retail tenant at the time of the land purchase with a fixed rent commencement date and there is a requirement to complete the construction in a timely basis and within a specific budget typically within eight months after we purchase the land the tenant or developer generally is required to pay construction cost overruns to the extent that they exceed the construction budget by more than a predetermined amount we also enter into a lease with the tenant at the time we purchase the land which generally requires the tenant to begin paying base rent when the store opens for business the base rent is calculated by multiplying a predetermined capitalization rate by our total investment in the property including the land cost for the property construction costs and capitalized interest in 2005 realty income acquired 21 development properties crest net did not acquire any development property in 2005 both realty income and crest net will continue to pursue development opportunities under similar arrangements in the future 

  




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

as used under this caption “risk factors” references to our capital stock include our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock and references to our stockholders include holders of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock in each case unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires 

  

in order to grow w e need to continue to acquire investment properties which may be subject to competitive pressures 

  

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

  

•   businesses 

•   individuals 

•   fiduciary accounts and plans and 

•   other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

  

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

  

our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent may be affected by competition within their industries from other operators 

  

the tenants leasing our properties can face significant competition from other operators this competition may adversely impact 

  

•   that portion if any of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a tenant’s revenues and 

•   the tenants’ results of operations or financial condition 

  

as a property owner we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities 

  

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

•   our knowledge of the contamination 

•   the timing of the contamination 

•   the cause of the contamination or 

•   the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental problems of which we are unaware associated with our properties in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

in addition several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other facilities with asbestos may be acquired by the company in the future environmental laws govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestoscontaining materials or acms and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

  

compliance   we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest in addition we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal state and local laws relating to acms 

  

insurance and indemnity   in june 2005 we entered into a new sevenyear environmental insurance policy on our property portfolio which replaced the previous fiveyear environmental insurance policy the limits on our new policy are 10 million per occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 40000 self insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that in the future we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all

  

  

our tenants are generally responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties for properties that have underground storage tanks in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located 

  

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities 

  

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we have been organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 

  

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

  

if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualifications as a reit we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or in some circumstances we may fail to qualify as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

•   we would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

•   we would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed to our stockholders 

•   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

•   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

•   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we may be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax our subsidiary crest net is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property 

  

distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 

  

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net 

  

  

income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock 

  

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of our common stock 

  

we are subject to risks associated with debt financing 

  

we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future including borrowings under our 300 million acquisition credit facility at february 10 2006 we had borrowings outstanding under our 300 million acquisition credit facility of 1316 million and we had a total of 755 million outstanding in unsecured notes and bonds to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face would increase as a result we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our 300 million credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due in addition our 300 million credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us on our common stock and preferred stock in the event of deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition our 300 million credit facility also provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal or interest on borrowings there under when due subject to any applicable grace period we and our subsidiaries may not pay any dividends on our capital stock including our outstanding common and preferred stock if this were to occur it would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the value of our debt securities 

  

our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of the common stock such as 

  

•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions

•   limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements

•   require the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on  our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and general corporate requirements

•   limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and

•   place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness

  

our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness 

  

our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

  

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors 

  

the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors which may change from time to time including but not limited to 

  

•   interest rate increases that may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and our debt securities

•   the market for other similar securities issued by other reits

•   general economic and financial market conditions

•   the financial condition performance and prospects of us and our competitors

•   changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us our competitors or our industry

•   changes in our credit ratings and

•   actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results

  

as a result of these and other factors investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease which could be substantial in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

  

real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue 

  

we are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

•   adverse changes in general or local economic conditions 

•   changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties 

•   changes in interest rates and operating expenses 

•   competition for tenants 

•   changes in market rental rates 

•   inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases 

•   renewal of leases at lower rental rates 

•   inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship including bankruptcy 

•   changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate 

•   uninsured property liability 

•   property damage or casualty losses 

•   unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws 

•   acts of terrorism and war and 

•   acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

  

an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 

  

under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons air water land or property due to activities conducted on the properties except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents additionally tenants are generally required at the tenant’s expense to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease liability and property damage insurance policies the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab foundations supports and other customarily excluded improvements our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage varying between 1000000 and 10000000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which it operates 

  

in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles obtained and paid for by 

  

  

the tenants as part of their risk management programs additionally we have obtained blanket liability flood and earthquake subject to substantial deductibles and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss however should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy we could lose all or part of our capital invested in and anticipated revenue from one or more of the properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operation 

  

our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the ada has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders 

  

property taxes may increase without notice 

  

the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 

  

a downturn in our tenants’ industries could adversely impact our business 

  

for 2005 our tenants in the convenience store and child care industries accounted for approximately 187 and 127 respectively of our rental revenue individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue for the year 2005 a downturn in any of these industries whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect tenants in these industries which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock 

  

in addition a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket retail chains that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail chains and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective business or in the regional or national economy 

  

we depend on key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the retail netleasing industry 

  

  

terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities the markets in which we operate and our results of operations 

  

terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants 

  

such events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and worldwide financial markets and economy they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the us or abroad any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust or reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal retail and real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 37 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements primarily 15 to 20years 

  

in addition we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties at december 31 2005 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

•   of 1646 retail properties 

•   with an occupancy rate of 985 or 1621 properties occupied of the 1646 properties in the portfolio 

•   leased to 101 different retail chains doing business in 29 separate retail industries 

•   located in 48 states 

•   with over 134 million square feet of leasable space and 

•   with an average leasable retail space per property of 8200 square feet 

  

of the 1646 properties in the portfolio 1641 or 997 are singletenant retail properties and the remaining five are multitenant distribution and office properties at december 31 2005 1617 or 985 of the 1641 singletenant properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately 124 years 

  

in addition our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiary crest net lease inc owned 17 properties with a total investment of 457 million at december 31 2005 which are classified as held for sale crest net was created to buy own and sell properties primarily to individual investors many of whom are involved in taxdeferred exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash reserves 

  

realty income is organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2005 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 657 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility 

  

300 million credit facility 

  

we have a 300 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2008 realty income’s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing under the credit facility at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 65 basis points with a facility fee of 15 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 80 basis points over libor at february 10 2006 we had a borrowing capacity of 1684 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 1316 million at an effective interest rate of 52 

  

  

the credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

mortgage debt 

  

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

  

universal shelf registration of 800 million 

  

in february 2004 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec registering the issuance from time to time of up to 800 million in aggregate value of common stock preferred stock and debt securities at february 10 2006 2279 million remained available for issuance under our universal shelf registration statement 

  

issuance of common stock in 2005 

  

in september 2005 realty income issued 41 million shares of common stock the net proceeds of approximately 927 from this offering were used to fund new property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 

  

issuance of 12year senior unsecured notes 

  

in september 2005 realty income issued 175 million in aggregate principal amount of 12year 5 3  8  senior unsecured notes due 2017 the price to the public for the notes was 99974 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5378 the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay borrowings under the company’s unsecured acquisition credit facility for property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 

  

issuance of 30year senior unsecured bonds 

  

in march 2005 realty income issued 100 million in aggregate principal amount of 30year 5 7  8  senior unsecured bonds due 2035 the price to the investor for the bonds was 98296 of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5998 the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes 

  

conservative capital structure 

  

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 10 2006 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 8866 million or approximately 303 of our total market capitalization of 292 billion we calculate our total market capitalization at february 10 2006 as the sum of 

  

•   shares of our common stock outstanding of 83880873 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 2278 per share or 191 billion 

•   aggregate liquidation value of the class d preferred stock of 1275 million 

•   outstanding borrowings of 1316 million on our credit facility and 

•   outstanding notes of 7550 million 

  

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes and bonds over the long term we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

credit agency ratings 

  

we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from fitch ratings moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings group currently fitch ratings has 

  

  

assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes moody’s rating has a “positive” outlook and the other ratings have a “stable” outlook 

  

we have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa3 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our preferred stock moody’s rating has a “positive” outlook and the other ratings have a “stable” outlook 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition

in october 1998 we issued 100 million of 814 monthly income senior notes due 2008 the “2008 notes” interest on the 2008 notes is payable monthly the 2008 notes are unsecured 

  

in may 1997 we issued 110 million of 734 senior unsecured notes due 2007 the “2007 notes” interest on the 2007 notes is payable semiannually 

  

all of these notes contain various covenants including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60 ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40 iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 15 times and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150 of our outstanding unsecured debt we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were issued 

  

the following is a summary of the key financial covenants to our senior unsecured notes the actual amounts are as of december 31 2005 

  

   

all of our outstanding notes have fixed interest rates our credit facility interest rate is variable 

  

  

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2005 dollars in millions 

  

table of obligations 

  

   

1 the credit facility balance was 1316 million as of february 10 2006 

2 interest on credit facility and notes has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december 31 2005 through their respective maturity dates 

3 other consists of 422 million of estimated unfunded costs on properties under development and 456000 of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 

  

our credit facility and note obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

  

preferred stock outstanding 

  

in may and october 2004 we issued an aggregate of 51 million shares of 7375 class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock beginning may 27 2009 shares of class d preferred stock are redeemable at our option for 2500 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on shares of class d preferred are paid monthly in arrears 

  

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investment 

  

realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

  

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatory redeemable preferred stock our financial position or results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standard board interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

acquisitions during 2005 

  

during 2005 realty income and crest net invested in aggregate 4866 million in 156 new properties and properties under development these 156 properties are located in 30 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 158 years as described below realty income acquired 135 properties and crest net acquired 21 properties 

  

included in the 4866 million is 4307 million invested by realty income in 135 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 84 these 135 properties are located in 28 states are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 156 years and will contain over 17 million leasable square feet the 135 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to 13 different retail chains in the convenience store drug store financial services health and fitness motor vehicle dealership restaurant and theater industries at december 31 2005 10 new properties acquired during 2005 were leased and under contract for development by the tenant with development costs funded by realty income with rent scheduled to begin at various times during the next 12 months 

  

included in the 4866 million is 559 million invested by crest net in 21 new retail properties and properties under development 

  

  

of the 4307 million realty income invested in real estate during 2005 439 million was invested in properties under development with rent scheduled to begin at various times during 2006 at december 31 2005 we also had committed to pay estimated unfunded development costs totaling 422 million 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

investments in existing properties 

  

in 2005 we capitalized costs of 16 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 570000 for releasing costs and 10 million for building improvements 

  

sales of investment properties 

  

during 2005 we sold 23 properties and sold a portion of land from two properties for an aggregate of 234 million which resulted in a gain on sales of 66 million this gain is included in discontinued operations except for 18000 that is included in other revenue the 23 properties sold consisted of one automotive service store two automotive tire service locations seven child care facilities two consumer electronics stores one convenience store one motor vehicle dealership one private education facility seven restaurants and one property classified as “other” the net proceeds from the sale of these properties were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility and to invest in new properties 

  

crest net property sales 

  

during 2005 crest net our whollyowned subsidiary sold 12 properties from its inventory for 235 million which resulted in a gain of 33 million 

  

crest net’s property inventory 

  

crest net’s property inventory totaled 457 million at december 31 2005 as compared to 101 million at december 31 2004 crest net’s properties are included in “real estate held for sale net” on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

the financial statements of crest net are consolidated into realty income’s financial statements all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

increases in monthly cash distributions to common stockholders 

  

we continue our 36year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased in april 2005 by 0000625 to 0110625 in july 2005 by 0000625 to 011125 in september 2005 by 000375 to 0115 in october 2005 by 0000625 to 0115625 and in january 2006 by 000625 to 011625 the increase in january 2006 was our 33rd consecutive quarterly increase and the 37th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2005 we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of 011 three in the amount of 0110625 two in the amount of 011125 one in the amount of 0115 and three in the amount of 0115625 totaling 134625 in december 2005 january 2006 and february 2006 we declared distributions of 011625 per share which were paid on january 17 2006 and february 15 2006 and will be paid on march 15 2006 respectively 

  

the monthly distribution of 011625 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 1395 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 61 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2278 on february 10 2006 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what the actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

  

  

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting polices one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation of buildings and improvements is computed using the straight—line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life no depreciation has been recorded on crest net’s properties because they are held for sale 

  

another significant judgment that must be made is if and when the impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable generally a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

rental revenue 

  

rental revenue was 1963 million for 2005 versus 1727 million for 2004 an increase of 236 million or 137 rental revenue was 1429 million in 2003 the increase in rental revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to 

  

•   the 135 retail properties acquired by realty income in 2005 which generated 121 million in 2005 

•   the 172 retail properties acquired by realty income in 2004 which generated 171 million in 2005 compared to 94 million in 2004 an increase of 77 million 

•   same store rents generated on 1269 properties during 2005 and 2004 increased by 13 million or 08 to 1581 million from 1568 million these properties were leased during all of both 2005 and 2004 

•   an increase in straightline rent and other noncash adjustments to rent of 15 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 and 

•   an increase of 807000 relating to the aggregate of i development properties acquired before 2004 that started paying rent in 2004 ii properties that were vacant during part of 2005 or 2004 and iii lease termination settlements these items in aggregate totaled 52 million in 2005 and 44 million in 2004 

  

realty income acquired 135 retail properties in 2005 excluding crest net acquisitions and as a result our 2005 operating results included less than a full year of rental revenue from these properties accordingly we anticipate that the contribution to rental revenue from these 135 properties will increase in 2006 because there 

  

  

will be a full year of rent from these properties 

  

our portfolio of retail real estate leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2005 our portfolio of 1646 retail properties was 985 leased with 25 properties available for lease one of which is a multitenant property 

  

of the 1646 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2005 1641 or 997 are singletenant properties and the remaining properties are multitenant distribution and office properties of the 1641 singletenant properties 1617 or 985  were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 124 years at december 31 2005 of our 1617 leased singletenant and certain other properties 1488 or 920 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

•   base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings 

•   fixed increases 

•   to a lesser degree overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales or 

•   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 12 million in 2005 13 million in 2004 and 11 million in 2003 percentage rent in 2005 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2006 

  

as of february 10 2006 transactions to lease or sell 6 of the 25 properties available for lease at december 31 2005 were underway or completed we anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several months although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this period it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 3 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 68 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 primarily due to higher average outstanding balances interest expense was 264 million in 2003 the following is a summary of the five components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

   

interest on outstanding credit facilities and notes increased by 85 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to higher average outstanding note balances in 2005 

  

  

at february 10 2006 the weighted average interest rate on our 

  

•   credit facility borrowings of 1316 million was 52 

•   notes payable of 7550 million was 63 and 

•   combined outstanding credit facility and notes of 8866 million was 61 

  

interest coverage ratio 

  

our interest coverage ratio for 2005 was 44 times for 2004 was 50 times and for 2003 was 53 times interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated in the following table divided by interest expense including interest recorded to discontinued operations we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to our interest coverage amount dollars in thousands 

  

   

1   crest net activities 

2   the 2005 amount includes intangibles recorded in connection with acquisitions of real estate acquired for resale 

3   includes interest expense recorded to “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

fixed charge coverage ratio 

  

our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2005 was 36 times for 2004 was 39 times and for 2003 was 39 times fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

  

interest coverage amount divided by interest expense plus preferred stock dividends dollars in thousands 

  

   

1 excludes the class b and class c preferred stock noncash charge of 3774 in 2004 for excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

2 includes interest expense recorded to “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization was 464 million in 2005 versus 399 million in 2004 and 322 million in 2003 the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2005 and 2004 are due to the acquisition of properties in 2005 2004 and 2003 which was partially offset by property sales in these years 

  

general and administrative expenses 

  

general and administrative expenses increased by 23 million to 154 million in 2005 versus 131 million in 2004 general and administrative expenses were 106 million in 2003 in 2005 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 78 as compared to 76 in 2004 and 74 in 2003 general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in costs of corporate insurance payroll employee benefits corporate governance and sarbanesoxley act of 2002 compliance costs 

  

as our property portfolio has grown and continues to grow we have increased and anticipate that we will continue to increase the level of our staffing we expect general and administrative expenses to moderately increase due to costs attributable to payroll staffing costs and corporate governance 

  

at february 10 2006 we had 69 permanent employees and four temporary employees as compared to february 15 2005 when we had 64 permanent employees and six temporary employees the temporary employees have been working on a record retention project that is expected to conclude in 2006 

  

property expenses 

  

property expenses are broken down into costs associated with nonnet leased multitenant properties unleased singletenant properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to the multitenant and unleased singletenant properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2005 25 properties were available for lease as compared to 32 at december 31 2004 and 26 at december 31 2003 

  

property expenses were 38 million in 2005 31 million in 2004 and 24 million in 2003 the 769000 increase in property expenses in 2005 is primarily attributable to an increase in costs associated with vacant properties and bad debt expense 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes were 813000 in 2005 as compared to 699000 in 2004 and 501000 in 2003 these amounts are for city and state income taxes paid by realty income the increases in 2005 and 2004 are due to an increase in rental revenue causing higher city and state income tax expense 

  

in addition crest net incurred state and federal income taxes of 943000 in 2005 as compared to 35 million in 2004 and 22 million in 2003 the decrease in 2005 over the 2004 and 2003 amounts are due to lower taxable income primarily attributable to lower gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale these amounts are included in “income from discontinued operations from real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

  

discontinued operations 

  

crest net acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties consequently we classify properties acquired by crest net as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them the operations of crest net’s properties are classified as “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

the following is a summary of crest net’s “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale” for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 dollars in thousands 

  

   

realty income’s operations from four properties listed as held for sale at december 31 2005 plus properties sold in 2005 2004 and 2003 have been classified as discontinued operations the following is a summary of our discontinued operations from real estate held for investment for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 dollars in thousands 

  

   

the following is a summary of our total discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 dollars in thousands 

  

   

  

gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale by crest net 

included in discontinued operations 

  

in 2005 crest net sold 12 properties for 235 million which resulted in a gain of 33 million in 2004 crest net sold 51 properties for 750 million which resulted in a gain of 103 million in 2003 crest net sold 27 properties for 452 million which resulted in a gain of 62 million all gains on sales of real estate acquired for resale are reported before income taxes 

  

at december 31 2005 crest net had 457 million invested in 17 properties which are held for sale our goal is for crest net to carry an average inventory of approximately 20 to 25 million in real estate crest net generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties it is our belief that at this level of inventory rental revenue will exceed the ongoing operating expenses of crest net without any property sales 

  

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

included in discontinued operations 

  

in 2005 we sold 23 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from two properties for 234 million and recognized a gain on sales of 66 million this gain is included in discontinued operations except for 18000 that is included in other revenue in 2004 we sold or exchanged 43 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from four properties for a total of 354 million and recognized a gain of 127 million this gain is included in discontinued operations except for 185000 that is included in other revenue in 2003 we sold or exchanged 35 properties and exchanged three excess land parcels from three properties for 231 million and recognized a gain of 72 million which is included in discontinued operations 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2005 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 471 million as held for sale which includes 455 million in properties owned by crest net in addition 219000 invested by crest net in real estate is included in other assets and was classified as intangible assets additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 15 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

  

provisions for impairments 

  

provisions for impairments of 186000 were recorded in 2005 on four properties as compared to 24 million in 2004 on six properties and 12 million on 11 properties in 2003 these provisions are included in “income from discontinued operations real estate held for investment” except for 151000 in 2005 which is included in property expenses 

  

preferred stock cash dividends and redemption charge 

  

we had preferred stock cash dividends of 94 million in 2005 as compared to 95 million in 2004 and 97 million in 2003 

  

when we redeemed our class b preferred stock in june 2004 and our class c preferred stock in july 2004 we incurred noncash charges of 24 million and 14 million respectively for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value these noncash charges represent the class b and class c preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders when the shares were redeemed these noncash charges equated to 005 per common share in 2004 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

  

net income available to common stockholders in 2005 decreased by 452000 to 897 million as compared to 902 million in 2004 net income available to common stockholders in 2003 was 767 million 

  

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2005 was 66 million as compared to 127 million during 2004 and 72 million in 2003 the gain recognized from the sale of properties acquired for resale during 2005 was 33 million as compared to 103 million during 2004 and 62 million during 2003 

  

funds from operations ffo 

available to common stockholders 

  

ffo for 2005 increased by 114 million or 96 to 1296 million as compared to 1182 million in 2004 and 1034 million in 2003 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure to ffo information regarding cash distributions paid and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for 2005 2004 and 2003 dollars in thousands 

  

   

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets reduced by gains on sales of investment property and extraordinary items 

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes noncash items such as depreciation the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

  

  

presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of realty income’s performance in addition ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

  

other noncash items and capitalized expenditures 

  

the following information includes noncash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio these items are not included in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at ffo analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 

  

   

1   the settlements on the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate risk prevention strategy that was used by the company in 1997 and 1998 which correlated to pending issuances of senior note securities we have not employed this strategy since 1998 

2   amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in may 1997 october 1998 january 1999 march 2003 november 2003 march 2005 and september 2005 these costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

3   a negative amount indicates that our straightline rent was greater than our actual cash rent collected a positive amount indicates that our straightline rent was less than our actual cash rent collected 

4   represents the class b and class c preferred s tock noncash charges for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value 

  

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

approximately 982 or 1617 of the 1646 properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

impact of accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 123r sharebased payments  statement no 123r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grantdate fair value of stock options and other 

  

  

equitybased compensation issued to employees we adopted statement no 123r on january 1 2006 the impact of adopting statement no 123r was not material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no 29  statement no 153 amends apb opinion no 29 and states that companies will no longer be permitted to use the “similar productive assets” concept to account for nonmonetary exchanges at book value with no gain being recognized an exchange must be accounted for at fair value if the exchange has commercial substance and fair value is determinable we adopted statement no 153 on january 1 2006 the impact of adopting statement no 153 was not material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of statement no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations interpretation no 47 requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform assetretirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated we adopted interpretation no 47 in the fourth quarter of 2005 the impact of adopting interpretation no 47 was not material to our financial position or results of operations 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes primarily at fixed rates and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december 31 2005 we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates fair values as of december 31 2005 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions

6   we base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december 31 2005 on the closing market price or indicative price per 

  

  

each note the fair value of the variable rate debt approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to those available in the market place at december 31 2005 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2005 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates our credit facility interest rate is variable based on our credit facility balance at december 31 2005 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 14 million per year 

  




 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent auditors on accountancy or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act 1934 rules 13a14c and 15d14c that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control—integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations “coso” of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

submitted on february 21 2006 by 

  

thomas a lewis chief executive officer and vice chairman 

paul m meurer chief financial office executive vice president and treasurer 

  

  

changes in internal controls there have not been any significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation there were no material weaknesses and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

 item 1   business 

  

the company 

  

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust or reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal retail and real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 36 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements primarily 15 to 20years 

  

in addition w e seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties our portfolio management focus includes 

  

•   contractual rent increases on existing leases 

•   rent increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit and 

•   the active management of our property portfolio including the releasing of vacant properties and selective sales of properties 

  

our acquisition of additional properties adheres to a focused strategy of primarily acquiring properties that are 

  

•   freestanding singletenant retail locations 

•   leased to regional and national retail chains and 

•   leased under longterm netlease agreements 

  

at december 31 2004 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

•   of 1533 retail properties 

•   with an occupancy rate of 979 or 1501 properties occupied of the 1533 properties in the portfolio 

•   leased to 93 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail industries 

•   located in 48 states 

•   with over 119 million square feet of leasable space and

we typically acquire retail store properties under longterm leases with retail chain store operators these transactions generally provide capital to retail chain owners and operators for expansion or other corporate purposes our acquisition and investment activities are concentrated in welldefined target markets and generally focus on retailers providing goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs 

  

our netlease agreements generally 

  

•   are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years 

•   require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses taxes insurance and maintenance and 

•   provide for future rent increases typically subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level

recent developments 

  

twoforone common stock split 

  

on december 31 2004 after the new york stock exchange closed we completed a 2for1 stock split at that time we issued to our common stockholders one share of common stock for each common share outstanding the total number of shares paid as a stock dividend to our common stockholders was 39650815 all common share amounts and per common share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the common stock split

common stock issuance 

  

in march 2004 we issued 32 million shares of common stock the net proceeds of 679 million from this offering were used to repay a portion of the borrowings on our 250 million unsecured acquisition credit facility including amounts that were borrowed to fund the acquisition of 112 convenience store properties in march 2004 

  

class d preferred stock issuance 

  

in may 2004 we issued 40 million shares of 7375 monthly income cumulative redeemable class d preferred stock with a liquidation value of 25 per share the issuance price was 25 per share and the net proceeds of approximately 964 million were used to redeem our outstanding class b and c preferred stock repay borrowings under our 250 million unsecured acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes 

  

in october 2004 we issued an additional 11 million shares of 7375 class d preferred stock for 254311 per share the net proceeds of 274 million were used to repay borrowings on our 250 million unsecured credit facility which had been used for recent acquisitions of new retail properties 

  

  

class b preferred stock redemption 

  

in june 2004 we redeemed all of the 2745700 outstanding shares of our class b preferred stock for 686 million each share was redeemed at a liquidation value of 2500 plus accrued and unpaid dividends at the time of the redemption 

  

in addition when our class b preferred stock was redeemed we incurred a noncash charge of 24 million representing the class b preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders in june 2004 

  

class c preferred stock redemption 

  

on july 30 2004 we redeemed all of the 1380000 outstanding shares of our class c preferred stock for 345 million each share was redeemed at a liquidation value of 2500 plus accrued and unpaid dividends at the time of the redemption 

  

in addition when our class c preferred stock was redeemed we incurred a noncash charge of 14 million representing the class c preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders in july 2004 

  

realty income and crest net aggregate acquisitions 

  

realty income and crest net invested 2153 million in aggregate in 194 new properties and properties under development in 2004 these 194 properties are located in 19 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 175 years 

  

in february 2005 we invested 673 million in a portfolio of 24 properties leased to rite aid corporation we acquired existing stores that are netleased to rite aid with an average remaining lease term of 142 years realty income plans to hold approximately 58 million in its core portfolio as longterm investments and approximately 9 million was acquired by crest net lease 

  

realty income acquisitions 

  

realty income invested 1938 million during 2004 in 172 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 95 these 172 properties are located in 18 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 175 years and will contain over 913000 leasable square feet 

  

of the 1938 million realty income invested in real estate during 2004 111 million was invested in properties under development that were acquired before 2004 estimated unfunded development costs on realty income and crest net properties under development at december 31 2004 totaled 130 million at december 31 2004 five new properties acquired during 2004 were leased and under contract for development by the tenant with development costs funded by realty income or crest net with rent scheduled to begin at various times during 2005 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

the 172 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to 12 different retail chains in seven industries automotive collision service automotive service convenience store health and fitness motor vehicle dealerships restaurant and sporting goods 

  

  

crest net acquisitions 

  

crest net invested 215 million during 2004 in 22 new retail properties and properties under development 

  

investments in existing properties 

  

in 2004 we capitalized costs of 11 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 323000 for releasing costs and 789000 for building improvements 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

  

net income available to common stockholders was 902 million in 2004 versus 767 million in 2003 an increase of 135 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 115 per share in 2004 as compared to 108 per share in 2003 during 2004 net income available to common stockholders included onetime noncash charges totaling 38 million or approximately 005 per share these noncash charges represent the class b and class c preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction in net income available to common stockholders in 2004 when the preferred stock was redeemed 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains and losses from the sale of investment properties the amount of gains and losses varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2004 was 127 million as compared to 72 million during 2003 

  

funds from operations ffo 

  

in 2004 our ffo increased by 148 million or 143 to 1182 million versus 1034 million in 2003 on a diluted per common share basis ffo was 150 in 2004 compared to 145 for 2003 an increase of 005 or 34 included in ffo per diluted common share for 2004 was 008 per share in noncash charges for property impairments and origination costs on redeemed preferred stock for 2004 noncash charges for property impairments of 24 million equated to 003 in ffo per diluted common share and noncash charges for origination costs on redeemed preferred stock of 38 million equated to 005 in ffo per diluted common share 

  

ffo for 2003 has been adjusted to reflect additional impairments on the sale of certain properties these additional impairments relate to properties where a contract for the sale of a property and the closing of the sale transaction occurred during the same quarterly period as these transactions were contracted for and closed during the same quarter losses on the sales were booked and reflected in the company’s financial statements but no impairments were booked on these properties in the company’s calculation of ffo the company now believes that such impairments on property sales should be deducted from the calculation of ffo ffo for 2003 was reduced by 672000 or 001 per share the losses from these transactions were previously included in the company’s calculation of net income and as such have no impact on the company’s previously reported consolidated statements of income or consolidated balance sheets for these periods 

  

see our discussion of ffo in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo 

  

crest net property sales 

  

during 2004 crest net sold 51 properties from its inventory for 750 million which resulted in a gain of 103 million 

  

crest net’s property inventory 

  

crest net’s property inventory at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 totaled 101 million and 533 million respectively and is included in real estate held for sale net on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

the financial statements of crest net are consolidated into realty income’s financial statements all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

  

sales of investment properties by realty income 

  

during 2004 we sold or exchanged 43 properties and a portion of land from four properties for an aggregate of 354 million which resulted in gains on sales of 127 million on 38 properties and impairments of 17 million on five properties the 43 properties sold consisted of 16 child care facilities 13 restaurants 10 convenience stores three consumer electronics stores and one automotive service location of this gain on sales 125 million is included in discontinued operations and 185000 is included in other revenue the net proceeds from the sale of these properties were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility and to invest in new properties 

  

increases in monthly cash distributions to common stockholders 

  

we continue our 35year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased by 0000625 in april 2004 to 0100625 in july 2004 to 010125 in october 2004 to 0109375 and in january 2005 to 011 the monthly distributions were also increased by 00075 per share in september 2004 to 010875 the increase in january 2005 was our 29 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 32 nd increase in the amount of our cash dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2004 we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of 010 three in the amount of 0100625 two in the amount of 010125 one in the amount of 010875 and three in the amount of 0109375 totaling 124125 per share in december 2004 january 2005 and february 2005 we declared distributions of 011 per share which were paid on january 18 2005 on february 15 2005 and will be paid on march 15 2005 respectively 

  

the monthly distribution of 011 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 132 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 53 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2484 on february 15 2005 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what the actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

  

distribution policy 

  

distributions are paid to our common stockholders and class d preferred stockholders on a monthly basis if as and when declared by our board of directors the class d preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 184375 per annum per share 

  

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains in 2004 our cash distributions totaled 1065 million or approximately 1078 of our estimated reit taxable income of 988 million our estimated reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes our 2004 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 974 million representing 824 of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of 1182 million 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” has generally been reduced to 15 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2002 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends except to the extent the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest net to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or reit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year or as discussed above dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends” distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in the stock distributions above that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain approximately 47 of the distributions made or deemed to have been made in 2004 to our common stockholders were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital 

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

investment philosophy 

  

we believe that owning an actively managed diversified portfolio of retail properties under longterm net leases produces consistent and predictable income under a netlease agreement the tenant agrees to pay monthly rent and property operating expenses taxes maintenance and insurance plus typically future rent increases generally subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that a portfolio of properties under longterm leases coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property expenses generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

investment strategy 

  

in identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is generally on providing expansion capital to retail chain owners and operators by acquiring then leasing back retail store locations we categorize retail tenants as 1 venture market 2 middle market and 3 upper market venture companies typically offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and 50 retail locations middle market retail chains typically have 50 to 500 retail locations operations in more than one geographic region have been successful through one or more economic cycles and have a proven replicable concept the upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500 or more locations operating nationally in a proven mature retail concept upper market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital 

  

realty income primarily focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because 

  

•   they generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that can adversely affect venture retailers 

•   they typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing options 

•   they generally have provided us with attractive riskadjusted returns over time since their financial strength has in many cases tended to improve as their businesses have matured 

•   their relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a greater number of stores and 

•   middle market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number of locations are closed due to underperformance 

  

we also focus on and have selectively made investments in properties of upper market retail chains we believe upper market retail chains can be attractive for investment because 

  

•   they typically are of a higher credit quality 

•   they usually are larger public and private retailers with more commonly recognized brand names 

•   they utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10000 to 50000 square feet and 

•   they are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger transaction sizes 

  

  

while our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to middle and upper market retail chains we also selectively seek investment opportunities with venture market retail chains periodically venture market opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices to meet our stringent investment standards however venture retail companies must have a welldefined retailing concept and strong financial prospects these opportunities are examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in making investments in this area 

  

historically our investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2004 approximately 816 of our rental revenue rent was derived from retailers with a service component in their business furthermore we believe these serviceoriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internet businesses 

  

credit strategy 

  

we generally provide saleleaseback financing to less than investment grade retail chains from 1970 through december 31 2004 we have acquired and leased back to regional and national retail chains 1678 properties including 177 properties that have been sold and have collected approximately 98 of the original contractual rent obligations on those properties we believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers 

  

we believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its retail business we believe the risk of default on a retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers’ individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

  

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

  

•   industry company market conditions and credit profile 

•   location profitability if profitability data is available and 

•   overall real estate characteristics including value and comparative rental rates 

  

the typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more retail locations generally the properties 

  

•   are located in highly visible areas 

•   have easy access to major thoroughfares and 

•   have attractive demographics 

  

acquisition strategy 

  

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national chains are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale advertising and the selection of prime retail locations we execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain store owners and operators doing business in a variety of industries by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting real estate for potential investment we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics 

  

•   freestanding commerciallyzoned property with a single tenant 

•   properties that are important retail locations for regional and national retail chains 

•   properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of their tenants with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares and 

•   properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm netlease agreements offering both current income and the potential for rent increases 

  

  

portfolio management strategy 

  

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested the portfolio is regularly analyzed with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality our executives review industry research tenant research property due diligence and significant portfolio management activities this monitoring typically includes regular review and analysis of 

  

•   the performance of various retail industries and 

•   the operation management business planning and financial condition of the tenants 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2004 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 172 million as held for sale which includes 101 million in properties owned by crest net additionally we anticipate selling properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified we anticipate we will receive between 15 million and 35 million in proceeds from the sale of investment properties during the next 12 months and we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

  

conservative capital structure 

  

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 15 2005 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 5710 million or approximately 213 of our total market capitalization of 268 billion we define our total market capitalization at february 15 2005 as the sum of 

  

•   shares of our common stock outstanding of 79581373 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 2484 per share or 198 billion 

•   liquidation value of the class d preferred stock of 1275 million 

•   outstanding borrowings of 910 million on our credit facility and 

•   outstanding notes of 4800 million 

  

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes over the long term we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

we have a 250 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2005 at february 15 2005 the outstanding balance on the acquisition credit facility was 910 million with an effective interest rate of approximately 35 a commitment fee of 02 per annum accrues on the total 250 million credit commitment of the credit facility the credit facility has been and is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains under longterm netlease agreements the credit facility has also been used to provide capital to subsidiaries for the purpose of funding the acquisition of properties we regularly evaluate our credit facility and may seek to extend renew or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

  

we use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions when outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a certain level generally in the range of 100 million to 150 million and capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock convertible preferred stock debt securities or convertible debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

we are currently assigned investment grade credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from fitch ratings moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s rating group currently fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes all of these ratings have been assigned a “stable” outlook 

  

we have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service inc has assigned a rating of baa3 and standard  poor’s rating group has assigned a rating of bbb to our preferred stock all of these ratings have been assigned a “stable” outlook 

  

the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

  

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

  

realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

  

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock our financial position or results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standard board interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

competitive strategy 

  

we believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

  

•   size and type of investment properties   we believe smaller 500000 to 10000000 netleased retail properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in today’s real estate environment due to the complexities of acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets we believe these types of properties have not experienced significant institutional ownership interest or the corresponding yield reduction experienced by larger incomeproducing properties we believe the less intensive daytoday property management required by netlease agreements coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of smaller properties is an effective investment strategy the tenants of our freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs in order to grow and expand they generally need capital since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back under a netlease arrangement allows the retail chain to free up capital 

  

•   investment in new retail industries   though we specialize in singletenant properties we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of retail industries we believe diversification will allow us to invest in retail industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find attractive these characteristics include but are not limited to retail industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national chain store operators can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations as well as capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base during 2004 we added two new industries financial services and motor vehicle dealerships to our portfolio 

  

  

•   diversification   diversification of the portfolio by retail industry type tenant and geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for our stockholders therefore further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective at december 31 2004 our retail property portfolio consisted of 1533 properties located in 48 states leased to 93 retail chains doing business in 30 industry segments each of the 30 industry segments represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for no more than 196 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2004 

  

•   management specialization   we believe that our management’s specialization in singletenant retail properties operated under netlease agreements is important to meeting our objectives we plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train highquality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership finance and management 

  

•   technology   we intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to efficiently and economically carry out our operations we maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio’s performance and actively manage our investments we believe that technology and informationbased systems will play an increasingly important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants 

  

properties 

  

at december 31 2004 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

•   of 1533 retail properties 

•   with an occupancy rate of 979 or 1501 properties occupied of the 1533 properties in the portfolio 

•   leased to 93 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail industries 

•   located in 48 states 

•   with over 119 million square feet of leasable space and 

•   with an average leasable retail space of 7800 square feet 

  

in addition to our real estate portfolio at december 31 2004 our subsidiary crest net had invested 101 million in a portfolio of eight retail properties located in five states these properties are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

at december 31 2004 1497 or 977 of our 1533 retail properties were owned under netlease agreements net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases generally subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or  to a lesser degree additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level 

  

our netleased retail properties primarily are leased to regional and national retail chain store operators most buildings are singlestory structures with adequate parking on site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods the properties tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic counts and adequate access and proximity to a sufficient population base constituting a suitable market or trade area for the retailer’s business

description of leasing structure 

  

at december 31 2004 1497 or 977 of our 1533 properties were net leased in most cases the leases 

  

•   are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years 

•   require the tenants to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses taxes insurance and maintenance and 

•   provide for future rent increases typically subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or to a lesser degree additional rent based upon the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level where leases provide for rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index generally these increases become part of the new permanent base rent where leases provide for percentage rent this additional rent is typically payable only if the tenants’ gross sales for a given period usually one year exceed a specified level and is then typically calculated as a percentage of only the amount of gross sales in excess of that level 

  

matters pertaining to certain properties and tenants 

  

of the 32 properties available for lease or sale at december 31 2004 all but one are singletenant properties twelve of the properties had been previously leased to child care operators eight to consumer electronic stores seven to restaurant operators three to shoe store operators one to an automotive service operator and one to a grocery store operator at december 31 2004 eleven of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations 

  

for 2004 each of our tenants accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue our tenants in the convenience store and child care industries accounted for approximately 192 and 144 respectively of our rental revenue for the year 2004 individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue a downturn in any of these industries whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect tenants in these industries which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations ability to make distributions to stockholders and our ability to make debt service payments 

  

a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket retail chains that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail chains and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective business or in the regional or national economy in general 

  

certain properties under development 

  

of the 172 properties realty income acquired in 2004 and the 22 properties acquired by crest net in 2004 all but five were occupied at february 15 2005 the five properties were leased and under contract for development by each property’s tenant with development costs funded by us or crest net with rent generally commencing when the property opens for business in the case of development properties we either enter into an agreement with a retail chain where the retailer retains a contractor to construct the improvements and we fund the costs of that development or we fund a developer who constructs the improvements in either case there is an executed lease at the time of the land purchase and there is a requirement to complete the construction on a timely basis generally within eight months after we purchase the land the tenant or developer generally is required to pay construction cost overruns to the extent that they exceed the construction budget by more than a predetermined amount we also enter into a lease with the tenant at the time we purchase the land which generally requires the tenant to begin paying base rent when the store opens for business the base rent is calculated as a percentage of our acquisition cost for the property including construction costs and capitalized interest in 2004 realty income acquired nine development properties and crest net acquired one development property five of which were generating rent as of february 15 2005 both realty income and crest net will continue to pursue development opportunities under similar arrangements 

  

  

other items 

  

competition for acquisition of real estate 

  

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

  

•   businesses 

•   individuals 

•   fiduciary accounts and plans and 

•   other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

  

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

the tenants leasing our properties can face significant competition from other operators this competition may adversely impact 

  

•   that portion if any of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a tenant’s revenues and 

•   the tenants’ results of operations or financial condition 

  

environmental liabilities 

  

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

•   our knowledge of the contamination 

•   the timing of the contamination 

•   the cause of the contamination or 

•   the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as to operators of oil change and tuneup facilities these facilities and some other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for release of hazardous substances 

  

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest and to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness 

  

since december 1996 we have maintained an environmental insurance policy on our property portfolio the limit on our current policy is 10 million per occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 25000 self insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties it is possible that our insurance will be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that we could be unable to continue to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all in the future we are currently discussing with our environmental insurance policy provider extending and modifying our environmental insurance policy 

  

  

taxation of the company 

  

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we are organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 

  

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

  

if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

•   we would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

•   we would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed to our stockholders 

•   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

•   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

•   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities 

  

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we are subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax our subsidiary crest net is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property 

  

effect of distribution requirements 

  

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

  

dilution of common stock 

  

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of our common stock 

  

real estate ownership risks 

  

we are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

•   adverse changes in general or local economic conditions 

•   changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties 

•   changes in interest rates and operating expenses 

•   competition for tenants 

•   changes in market rental rates 

•   inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases 

•   renewal of leases at lower rental rates 

•   inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship including bankruptcy 

•   changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate 

•   uninsured property liability 

•   property damage or casualty losses 

•   unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws 

•   acts of terrorism and war and 

•   acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

  

dependence on key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ®  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust or reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains we have inhouse acquisition leasing legal retail and real estate research portfolio management and capital markets expertise over the past 36 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under longterm lease agreements primarily 15 to 20years

•   of 1533 retail properties 

•   with an occupancy rate of 979 or 1501 properties occupied of the 1533 properties in the portfolio 

•   leased to 93 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail industries

in addition our whollyowned taxable reit subsidiary crest net lease inc owned eight properties with a total investment of 101 million at december 31 2004 these properties are classified as held for sale crest net was created to buy own and sell properties primarily to individual investors many of whom are involved in taxdeferred exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash reserves 

  

realty income is organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2004 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 21 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future except that we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility 

  

250 million bank credit facility 

  

we have a 250 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2005 realty income’s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing under the 250 million credit facility at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 90 basis points with a facility fee of 20 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 110 basis points over libor at february 15 2005 we had a borrowing capacity of 1590 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 910 million at an effective interest rate of 35 we regularly evaluate our credit facility and may seek to extend renew or replace our credit facility to the extent we deem appropriate 

  

  

the credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

  

universal shelf registration of 800 million 

  

in february 2004 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec registering the issuance from time to time of up to 800 million in aggregate value of common stock preferred stock and debt securities at february 15 2005 6004 million remained available for issuance under our universal shelf registration statement 

  

issuance of common stock in 2004 

  

in march 2004 we issued 32 million shares of common stock the net proceeds of 679 million were used to repay borrowings under our 250 million acquisition credit facility including amounts that were borrowed to fund the acquisition of 112 convenience store properties in march 2004 

  

common stock split 

  

realty income completed a 2for1 stock split after the market close on december 31 2004 as a result of the stock split total outstanding shares were increased from approximately 3965 million shares to 7930 million shares 

  

issuance of preferred stock in 2004 

  

in may 2004 we issued 40 million shares of 7375 monthly income class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation value of 25 per share the net proceeds of 964 million from this issuance were used to redeem a portion of the outstanding class b and class c preferred stock repay borrowings outstanding under our 250 million acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes dividends on the class d preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears

conservative capital structure 

  

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 15 2005 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 5710 million or approximately 213 of our total market capitalization of 268 billion we define our total market capitalization at february 15 2005 as the sum of 

  

•   shares of our common stock outstanding of 79581373 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 2484 per share or 198 billion 

•   liquidation value of the class d preferred stock of 1275 million 

•   outstanding borrowings of 910 million on our credit facility and 

•   outstanding notes of 4800 million 

  

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes over the long term we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us

all of our outstanding notes have fixed interest rates our credit facility interest rate is variable 

  

the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31 2004 dollars in millions 

  

table of obligations 

  

   

1 the credit facility balance was 910 million as of february 15 2005 

  

2 interest on credit facility and notes has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december 31 2004 through their respective maturity dates 

  

3 other consists of 130 million of estimated unfunded costs on properties under development and 10 million of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 

  

  

our credit facility and note obligations are unsecured accordingly we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 

  

preferred stock outstanding 

  

in may 2004 we issued 40 million shares of 7375 class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock beginning may 27 2009 the class d preferred shares are redeemable at our option for 2500 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends dividends on the class d preferred are paid monthly in arrears the net proceeds of 964 million from this issuance were used to redeem a portion of the outstanding class b and class c preferred stock repay borrowings outstanding under our 250 million acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes 

  

in october 2004 we issued an additional 11 million shares of 7375 class d preferred stock the net proceeds of approximately 274 million were used to repay borrowings under our 250 million unsecured acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes 

  

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investment 

  

realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

  

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock our financial position or results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standard board interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

acquisitions during 2004 

  

realty income and crest net 

  

realty income and crest net invested 2153 million in aggregate in 194 new properties and properties under development in 2004 these 194 properties are located in 19 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease length of 175 years 

  

realty income 

  

realty income invested 1938 million in 172 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 95 in 2004 these 172 properties are located in 18 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease length of 175 years and will contain over 913000 leasable square feet 

  

of the 1938 million realty income invested in real estate during 2004 111 million was invested in properties under development that were acquired before 2004 estimated unfunded development costs on realty income and crest net properties under development at december 31 2004 totaled 130 million at december 31 2004 five new properties acquired during 2004 were leased and under contract for development by the tenant with development costs funded by realty income or crest net with rent scheduled to begin at various times during 2005 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate on our investments is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

  

the 172 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to 12 different retail chains in seven industries automotive collision service automotive service convenience store health and fitness motor vehicle dealerships restaurant and sporting goods during 2004 we added two new industries motor vehicle dealerships and financial services to our portfolio 

  

crest net 

  

crest net invested 215 million during 2004 in 22 new retail properties and properties under development 

  

investments in existing properties 

  

in 2004 we capitalized costs of 11 million on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 323000 for releasing costs and 789000 for building improvements 

  

sales of investment properties 

  

during 2004 we sold or exchanged 43 properties and sold a portion of land from four properties for an aggregate of 354 million which resulted in gains on sales of 127 million for 38 properties and impairments of 17 million on five properties the 43 properties sold consisted of 16 child care facilities 13 restaurants 10 convenience stores three consumer electronics stores and one automotive service location of this gain on sales 125 million is included in discontinued operations and 185000 is included in other revenue the net proceeds from the sale of these properties were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility and to invest in new properties 

  

crest net property sales 

  

during 2004 crest net our whollyowned subsidiary sold 51 properties from its inventory for 750 million which resulted in a gain of 103 million 

  

crest net’s property inventory 

  

crest net’s property inventory at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 totaled 101 million and 533 million respectively and is included in real estate held for sale net on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

the financial statements of crest net are consolidated into realty income’s financial statements all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

increases in monthly cash distributions to common stockholders 

  

we continue our 35year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased by 0000625 in april 2004 to 0100625 in july 2004 to 010125 in october 2004 to 0109375 and in january 2005 to 011 the monthly distributions were also increased by 00075 per share in september 2004 to 010875 the increase in january 2005 was our 29th consecutive quarterly increase and the 32nd increase in the amount of our cash dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2004 we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of 010 three in the amount of 0100625 two in the amount of 010125 one in the amount of 010875 and three in the amount of 0109375 totaling 124125 per share in december 2004 january 2005 and february 2005 we declared distributions of 011 per share which were paid on january 18 2005 on february 15 2005 and will be paid on march 15 2005 respectively 

  

the monthly distribution of 011 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 132 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 53 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 2484 on february 15 2005 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what the actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

  

stock and senior debt purchase program 

  

in january 2000 our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 10 million of our outstanding common and preferred shares and senior debt securities from time to time since january 2000 we concluded that our share price justified purchasing shares since this provided an attractive return on our investment capital we purchased an aggregate of 67 million of our securities in 2000 and 2001 we have not purchased any of our securities after 2001 but may do so from time to time in the future

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting polices one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation of buildings and improvements is computed using the straightline method over an estimated useful life of 25 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life no depreciation has been recorded on crest net’s properties because they are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

another significant judgment that must be made is the impairment losses taken on our properties when events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable generally a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

rental revenue 

  

rental revenue was 1744 million for 2004 versus 1447 million for 2003 an increase of 297 million or 206 rental revenue was 1292 million in 2002 the increase in rental revenue in 2004 compared to 2003 is attributable to 

  

•   the 172 retail properties acquired by realty income in 2004 which generated 94 million in 2004 

•   the 241 retail properties acquired by realty income in 2003 which generated 264 million in 2004 compared to 76 million in 2003 an increase of 188 million 

•   same store rents generated on 1052 properties during 2004 and 2003 increased by 24 million or 18 to 1323 million from 1299 million these properties were leased during all of both 2004 and 2003 

•   an increase in straightline rent of 176000 in 2004 as compared to 2003 and 

•   a decrease of 771000 relating to the aggregate of i development properties acquired before 2003 that started paying rent in 2003 ii properties that were vacant during part of 2003 or 2004 and iii lease termination settlements these items in aggregate totaled 55 million in 2004 and 63 million in 2003 

  

realty income acquired 172 retail properties in 2004 excluding crest net acquisitions and as a result our 2004 operating results included less than a full year of rental revenue from these properties accordingly we anticipate that the contribution to rental revenue from these 172 properties will increase in 2005 because 2005 will include a full year of rent from these properties 

  

  

of the 1533 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2004 1528 or 997 are singletenant properties and the remaining properties are multitenant properties of the 1528 singletenant properties 1497 or 980 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately 120 years at december 31 2004 of our 1497 leased singletenant properties 1381 or 923 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

•   base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings 

•   fixed increases 

•   to a lesser degree overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales or 

•   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 13 million in 2004 11 million in 2003 and 15 million in 2002 percentage rent in 2004 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2005 

  

our portfolio of retail real estate leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2004 our portfolio of 1533 retail properties was 979 leased with 32 properties available for lease one of which is a multitenant property transactions to lease or sell 17 of the 32 properties available for lease at december 31 2004 were underway or completed as of february 15 2005 we anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next six months although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this period it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 3 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 77 million higher in 2004 than in 2003 primarily due to higher average outstanding note balances interest expense was 231 million in 2002 the following is a summary of the five components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

interest on outstanding credit facilities and notes increased by 75 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to higher average outstanding note balances in 2004  in 2002 unamortized fees of 406000 relating to our previous credit facilities which were canceled in october 2002 were charged to interest expense 

  

  

at february 15 2005 the weighted average interest rate on our 

  

•   credit facility borrowings of 910 million was 35 

•   notes payable of 480 million was 67 and 

•   combined outstanding credit facility and notes of 5710 million was 62 

  

our notes payable were all issued at fixed interest rates and are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates interest on credit facility borrowings is subject to fluctuations in interest rates 

  

interest coverage ratio 

  

our interest coverage ratio was 50 times for 2004 53 times for 2003 and 55 times for 2002 interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated in the following table divided by interest expense including interest recorded to discontinued operations we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

the following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to our interest coverage amount dollars in thousands 

  

   

1   crest net activities 

  

2   includes interest expense recorded to “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

  

fixed charge coverage ratio 

  

our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2004 2003 and 2002 was 39 times fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

interest coverage amount divided by interest expense plus preferred stock dividends dollars in thousands 

  

   

1 excludes the class b and class c preferred stock noncash charge of 3774 in 2004 for excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed 

2 includes interest expense recorded to “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization was 403 million in 2004 versus 327 million in 2003 and 293 million in 2002 the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of properties in 2004 2003 and 2002 which was partially offset by property sales in these years 

  

general and administrative expenses 

  

general and administrative expenses increased by 25 million to 131 million in 2004 versus 106 million in 2003 general and administrative expenses were 90 million in 2002 in 2004 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 75 as compared to 73 in 2003 and 70 in 2002 general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in costs of corporate insurance payroll employee benefits corporate governance and sarbanesoxley act of 2002 compliance costs 

  

as our property portfolio has grown and continues to grow we have increased and anticipate that we will continue to increase the level of our staffing we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to costs attributable to payroll staffing costs and corporate governance corporate governance costs relate to compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

at february 15 2005 we had 69 employees six of which are part time plus one contract consultant compared to 58 at february 16 2004 and 56 at march 1 2003 

  

property expenses 

  

property expenses are broken down into costs associated with nonnet leased multitenant properties unleased singletenant properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to the multitenant and unleased singletenant properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2004 32 properties were available for lease as compared to 26 at december 31 2003 and 27 at december 31 2002 

  

property expenses were 32 million in 2004 25 million in 2003 and 22 million in 2002 the 700000 increase in property expenses in 2004 is primarily attributable to an increase in costs associated with vacant properties 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes were 699000 in 2004 as compared to 501000 in 2003 and 496000 in 2002 these amounts are for city and state income taxes paid by realty income the increase in 2004 is due to an increase in rental revenue causing higher city and state income tax expense 

  

  

in addition crest net incurred state and federal income taxes of 35 million in 2004 as compared to 22 million in 2003 and 12 million in 2002 these increases in 2004 over the 2003 and 2002 amounts are due to greater taxable income primarily attributable to higher gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale these amounts are included in “income from discontinued operations from real estate acquired for resale by crest” 

  

discontinued operations 

  

crest net acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties consequently we classify properties acquired by crest net as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them the operations of crest net’s properties are classified as “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale by crest” the following is a summary of crest net’s “income from discontinued operations real estate acquired for resale” for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 dollars in thousands 

  

   

realty income’s operations from six properties listed as held for sale at december 31 2004 plus properties sold after 2001 have been classified as discontinued operations the following is a summary of our discontinued operations from real estate held for investment for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 dollars in thousands 

  

   

  

the following is a summary of our total discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 dollars in thousands 

  

   

gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale by crest net 

included in discontinued operations 

  

in 2004 crest net sold 51 properties for 750 million which resulted in a gain of 103 million in 2003 crest net sold 27 properties for 452 million which resulted in a gain of 62 million in 2002 crest net sold 23 properties for 273 million which resulted in a gain of 35 million all gains on sales of real estate acquired for resale are reported before income taxes 

  

at december 31 2004 crest net had 101 million invested in eight properties which are held for sale our goal is for crest net to carry an average inventory of approximately 20 to 25 million in real estate crest net generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties it is our belief that at this level of inventory rental revenue will exceed the ongoing operating expenses of crest net without any property sales 

  

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

included in discontinued operations 

  

in 2004 we sold or exchanged 43 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from four properties for 354 million and recognized a gain on sales of 127 million of which 125 million is included in discontinued operations and 185000 is included in other revenue in 2003 we sold or exchanged 35 investment properties for a total of 231 million and recognized a gain of 72 million which is included in discontinued operations in 2002 we sold or exchanged 35 properties for 202 million and recognized a gain of 65 million of which 62 million is included in discontinued operations and 349000 is included in other revenue 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2004 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 172 million as held for sale which includes 101 million in properties owned by crest net additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between 15 million and 35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

  

provisions for impairment 

  

provisions for impairment of 24 million were recorded on six properties in 2004 as compared to 12 million on 11 properties in 2003 and 15 million on 10 properties in 2002 these impairment losses are included in discontinued operations real estate held for investment 

  

two of the largest impairments taken in 2004 totaled 20 million of the impairments recorded in 2004 13 million was attributable to a property originally leased to a shoe store operator that filed for bankruptcy and rejected the lease the property was leased to a restaurant operator who exercised a purchase option and purchased the property in december 2004 also in 2004 we recorded an impairment of 716000 on one convenience store location to reduce its carrying value to zero this property is classified as held for sale on our balance sheet this impairment was the result of a title insurance company failing to timely record the deed on this property it is likely that through our tenant’s bankruptcy proceedings our title to this property will be divested we believe that we have a strong claim against the title insurance company and others for the loss of

  

  

the current fair market value of the property plus rent which we may be required to repay to the tenant and direct and incidental costs incurred our claim against the title insurance company and others is estimated to be between 750000 and 13 million which is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements as this represents a contingent gain 

  

during 2004 certain amounts were reclassified to provisions for impairments and gain on sales of investment properties for 2003 and 2002 that relate to properties where a contract for the sale of a property and the closing of the sale transaction occurred during the same quarterly period as these transactions were contracted for and closed during the same quarter losses on the sales were previously booked and reflected in the company’s financial statements but were not classified as impairments we now believe that such impairments on property sales should be classified separately from gain on sales of investment properties provisions for impairments and gain on sales on investment properties were both increased by 672000 for 2003 provisions for impairments and gain on sales on investment properties were both increased by 200000 for 2002 the losses from these transactions were previously included in the company’s calculation of net income and as such have no impact on our previously reported consolidated statements of income or consolidated balance sheets for these periods 

  

preferred stock cash dividends and redemption charge 

  

we had preferred stock cash dividends of 95 million in 2004 as compared to 97 million in 2003 and 2002 the decrease in 2004 is due to the redemption of our class b preferred stock in june 2004 and the redemption of our class c preferred stock in july 2004 which was offset by the issuance of our class d preferred stock in may 2004 and october 2004 

  

when we redeemed our class b preferred stock in june 2004 and our class c preferred stock in july 2004 we incurred noncash charges of 24 million and 14 million respectively for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value these noncash charges represent the class b and class c preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders when the shares were redeemed these noncash charges equate to 005 per common share in 2004 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

  

net income available to common stockholders in 2004 increased by 135 million or 176 to 902 million as compared to 767 million in 2003 net income available to common stockholders in 2002 was 690 million 

  

net income available to common stockholders includes gains and losses from the sale of investment properties by realty income and properties acquired for resale by crest net the amount of gains and losses varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2004 was 127 million as compared to 72 million during 2003 and 65 million in 2002 the gain recognized from the sale of properties acquired for resale during 2004 was 103 million as compared to 62 million during 2003 and 35 million during 2002 

  

  

funds from operations ffo 

available to common stockholders 

  

ffo for 2004 increased by 148 million or 143 to 1182 million as compared to 1034 million in 2003 and 935 million in 2002 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure to ffo information regarding cash distributions paid and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for 2004 2003 and 2002 dollars in thousands 

  

   

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry reduced by gains on sales of investment property and extraordinary items 

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes noncash items such as depreciation the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

  

presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of realty income’s performance in addition ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to make interest payments 

  

  

other noncash items and capitalized expenditures 

  

the following information includes noncash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio these items are not utilized in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at funds from operations analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 

  

   

1 amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in may 1997 october 1998 january 1999 march 2003 and november 2003 these costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

  

2 negative amount represents that our straightline rent was more than our actual cash rent collected by the amount indicated 

  

impact of inflatio n 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

impact of accounting prono uncements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 123r sharebased payments  statement no 123r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grantdate fair value of stock options and other equitybased compensation issued to employees the impact of adopting statement no 123r is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no 29  statement no 153 amends apb opinion no 29 and states that companies will no longer be permitted to use the “similar productive assets” concept to account for nonmonetary exchanges at book value with no gain being recognized an exchange must be accounted for at fair value if the exchange has commercial substance and fair value is determinable statement no 153 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  




 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes primarily at fixed rates and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december 31 2004 we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

  

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the following table presents by year of expected maturity the principal amounts average interest rates fair values as of december 31 2004 this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions 

  

expected maturity data 

  

   

1 the credit facility expires in october 2005 the credit facility balance as of february 15 2004 was 910 million 

  

2 110 million matures in may 2007 

  

3 100 million matures in october 2008 

  

4 20 million matures in january 2009 

  

5 100 million matures in march 2013 and 150 million matures in november 2015 

  

6 we base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december 31 2004 on the closing market price or indicative price per each note the fair value of the variable rate debt approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to those available in the market place 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2004 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

all of our outstanding notes have fixed interest rates our credit facility interest rate is variable based on our credit facility balance at december 31 2004 a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest costs by 236000 per year 

  

  




 item 9    changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent auditors on accountancy or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a    controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act 1934 rules 13a14c and 15d14c that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that

  

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

  

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

  

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 

  

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control—integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations “coso” of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

submitted on march 3 2005 by 

thomas a lewis chief executive officer and vice chairman 

paul m meurer chief financial office executive vice president and treasurer 

  

  

changes in internal controls there have not been any significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation there were no material weaknesses and therefore no corrective actions were taken 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

acquisitions during 2003 

  

realty income and crest net aggregate acquisitions 

  

realty income and crest net invested 3716 million in aggregate in 302 new properties and properties under development in 2003 these 302 properties are located in 25 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 199 years 

  

realty income 

  

realty income invested 2840 million during 2003 in 242 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 98 these 242 properties are located in 20 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease term of 199 years and will contain approximately 15 million leasable square feet 

  

  

of the 2840 million realty income invested in real estate during 2003 131 million was invested in properties under development during 2003 that were acquired before 2003 estimated unfunded development costs on realty income and crest net properties under development at december 31 2003 totaled 83 million at dec ember 31 2003 eight new properties acquired during 2003 were leased and under development pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to develop the properties with development costs funded by realty income or crest net with rent scheduled to begin at various times during first nine months of 2004 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

the 242 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to 15 different retail chains in 10 industries automotive collision service automotive service automotive tire service convenience store equipment rental service grocery store home improvement restaurant sporting goods and travel plaza during 2003 we added two new industries to our portfolio they are equipment rental service and travel plaza we also segregated the automotive tire service industry from the automotive parts industry this segregation was made because the two industries have different economic characteristics 

  

crest net 

  

crest net invested 876 million during 2003 in 60 new retail properties and properties under development 

  

investments in existing properties 

  

in 2003 we capitalized costs of 656000 on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 392000 for releasing costs and 264000 for building improvements 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

  

net income available to common stockholders was 767 million in 2003 versus 690 million in 2002 an increase of 77 million on a diluted per common share basis net income was 215 per share in 2003 as compared to 203 per share in 2002 

  

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains and losses from the sale of investment properties the amount of gains and losses varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2003 was 65 million as compared to 63 million during 2002 

  

funds from operations ffo 

  

in 2003 our ffo increased by 103 million or 110 to 1040 million versus 937 million in 2002 see our discussion of ffo in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo 

  

in 2003 crest net generated 46 million in ffo for realty income the future contribution if any to our ffo by crest net will depend on the timing and the number of property acquisitions and sales it achieves if any in a given year 

  

  

crest net property sales 

  

during 2003 crest net sold 27 properties from its inventory for 452 million which resulted in a gain of 62 million 

  

crest net’s property inventory 

  

crest net’s property inventory at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 totaled 533 million and 46 million respectively and is included in real estate held for sale net on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

the financial statements of crest net are consolidated into realty income’s financial statements all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

sales of investment properties by realty income 

  

during 2003 we sold 35 properties and exchanged excess land parcels from three properties for an aggregate of 231 million which resulted in a gain of 65 million the 35 properties sold consisted of 19 child care facilities nine restaurants three home improvement stores two auto service location one consumer electronics store and one other property the land exchanges were on three convenience store locations these gains are included in discontinued operations the net proceeds from the sale of these properties were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility and to invest in new properties 

  

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

  

we continue our 34year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased by 000125 on four separate occasions in april 2003 the monthly distribution increase per share was to 019625 in july 2003 to 01975 in october 2003 to 019875 and in january 2004 to 020 the increase in january 2004 was our 25 th consecutive quarterly increase and the 27 th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in 1994 in 2003 we paid 12 monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of 0195 three in the amount of 019625 three in the amount of 01975 and three in the amount of 019875 totaling 23625 per share in december 2003 january 2004 and february 2004 we declared distributions of 020 per share which were paid on january 15 2004 february 17 2004 and will be paid on march 15 2004 respectively 

  

the monthly distribution of 020 per share represents a current annualized distribution of 240 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 56 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of 4285 on february 13 2004 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what the actual distribution yield will be in any future period 

  

distribution policy 

  

distributions are paid to our common stockholders and class c preferred stockholders on a monthly basis and are paid to our class b preferred stockholders on a quarterly basis if as and when declared by our board of directors the class b preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 9375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 234375 per annum per share the class c preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 95 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference equivalent to 2375 per annum per share 

  

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains in 2003 our distributions totaled approximately 1081 of our estimated reit taxable income 

  

 

our estimated reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and amortization we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes our 2003 distributions to common stockholders were 806 of our funds from operations available to common stockholders 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo cash flow from operations financial condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended our debt service requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility 

  

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” has generally been reduced from 386 to 15 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2002 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends except to the extent the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiary crest net to income that was subject to tax at the corporatereit level for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year or as discussed above dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends” distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in the stock distributions above that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain approximately 64 of the distributions made or deemed to have been made in 2003 to our common stockholders were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital 

  

  

business philosophy and strategy 

  

investment philosophy 

  

we believe that the longterm ownership of an actively managed diversified portfolio of retail properties under longterm netlease agreements produces consistent predictable income under a netlease agreement the tenant agrees to pay monthly rent and property operating expenses taxes maintenance and insurance plus typically future rent increases generally subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level we believe that longterm leases coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property expenses generally produce a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income 

  

investment strategy 

  

in identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is on providing expansion capital to retail chains by acquiring then leasing back their retail store locations we categorize retail tenants as 1 venture market 2 middle market and 3 upper market venture companies typically offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and 50 retail outlets middle market retail chains typically have 50 to 500 retail outlets operations in more than one geographic region have been successful through one or more economic cycles and have a proven replicable concept the upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500 or more stores operating nationally in a proven mature retail concept upper market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital 

  

  

realty income primarily focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because 

  

•   they generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that can adversely affect venture retailers 

•   they typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing options 

•   they generally have provided us with attractive riskadjusted returns over time since their financial strength has in many cases tended to improve as their businesses have matured 

•   their relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a greater number of stores and 

•   middle market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number of locations are closed due to underperformance 

  

we also focus on and have selectively made investments in properties of upper market retail chains we believe upper market retail chains can be attractive for investment because 

  

•   they typically are of a higher credit quality 

•   they usually are larger brand name public and private retailers 

•   they utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10000 to 50000 square feet and 

•   they are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger transaction sizes 

  

while our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to middle and upper market retail chains we also selectively seek investment opportunities with venture market retail chains periodically venture market opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices to meet our stringent investment standards however venture retail companies must have a welldefined retailing concept and strong financial prospects these opportunities are examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in making investments in this area 

  

historically our investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable because of this investment focus for the quarter ended december 31 2003 approximately 77 of our rental revenue rent was derived from retailers with a service component in their business furthermore we believe these serviceoriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from internet businesses 

  

credit strategy 

  

we generally provide saleleaseback financing to less than investment grade retail chains from 1970 through december 31 2003 we have acquired and leased back to regional and national retail chains 1508 properties including 151 properties that have been sold and have collected approximately 98 of the original contractual rent obligations on those properties we believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive riskadjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers 

  

we believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations because we own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its retail business we believe the risk of default on a retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general obligations it has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers’ individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers 

  

  

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential investment based on 

  

•   industry company market conditions and credit profile 

•   location profitability if profitability data is available and 

•   overall real estate characteristics including value and comparative rental rates 

  

the standard profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition generally are those with 50 or more retail stores that are located in highly visible areas with easy access to major thoroughfares and attractive demographics 

  

acquisition strategy 

  

we seek to invest in industries in which several wellorganized regional and national chains are capturing market share through service quality control economies of scale mass media advertising and the selection of prime retail locations we execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain stores in a variety of industries by acquiring then leasing back their retail store locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries tenants and property locations for investment our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value in selecting real estate for potential investment we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics 

  

•   freestanding commerciallyzoned property with a single tenant 

•   properties that are important retail locations for regional and national retail chains 

•   properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of their tenants with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares and 

•   properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of longterm netlease agreements offering both current income and the potential for rent increases 

  

portfolio management strategy 

  

the active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our portfolio for changes that could affect the performance of the industries tenants and locations in which we have invested the portfolio is regularly analyzed with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality our executives review industry research tenant research property due diligence and significant portfolio management activities this monitoring typically includes regular review and analysis of 

  

•   the performance of various retail industries 

•   the operation management business planning and financial condition of the tenants and 

•   the health of the individual markets in which we own properties from both an economic and real estate viewpoint 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2003 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 601 million as held for sale which includes 533 million in properties owned by crest net additionally we anticipate selling properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified we anticipate we will receive between 15 million and 35 million in proceeds from the sale of investment properties during the next 12 months and we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

  

  

conservative capital structure 

  

we believe our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 13 2004 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 4930 million or approximately 222 of our total market capitalization of 222 billion we define our total market capitalization at february 13 2004 as the sum of 

  

•   shares of our common stock outstanding of 38006034 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 4285 per share or 163 billion 

•   liquidation value of the class b preferred stock of 686 million 

•   liquidation value of the class c preferred stock of 345 million 

•   outstanding borrowings of 130 million on our credit facility and 

•   outstanding notes of 4800 million 

  

we have a 250 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2005 at february 16 2004 the outstanding balance on the acquisition credit facility was 130 million with an effective interest rate of approximately 20 a commitment fee of 02 per annum accrues on the total 250 million credit commitment of the credit facility the credit facility has been and is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains under longterm netlease agreements the credit facility has also been used to provide capital to subsidiaries for the purpose of funding the acquisition of properties 

  

we use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property acquisitions when outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a certain level generally in the range of 100 million to 150 million and capital is available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the issuance of common stock preferred stock convertible preferred stock debt securities or convertible debt securities we cannot assure you however that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms 

  

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes over the longterm we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 

  

we currently are assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from fitch ratings moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings group currently fitch has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poor’s has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes these ratings could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also have received credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moody’s investors service has assigned a rating of baa3 and standard  poor’s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb these ratings could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

  

 

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments 

  

realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

  

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock our financial position or results of operations are currently not affected by financial accounting standard board interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

competitive strategy 

  

we believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages 

  

•   size and type of investment properties   we believe smaller 500000 to 10000000 netleased retail properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in today’s real estate environment due to the complexities of acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets we believe these types of properties have not experienced significant institutional ownership interest or the corresponding yield reduction experienced by larger incomeproducing properties we believe the less intensive daytoday property management required by netlease agreements coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of smaller properties is an effective investment strategy the tenants of our freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs in order to grow and expand they generally need capital since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back under a netlease arrangement allows the retail chain to free up capital 

  

•   investment in new retail industries   though we specialize in singletenant properties we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of retail industries we believe diversification will allow us to invest in retail industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find attractive these characteristics include but are not limited to retail industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national chain store operators can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations as well as capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base 

  

•   diversification   diversification of the portfolio by retail industry type tenant and geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for our stockholders further diversification of our portfolio is an objective of ours at december 31 2003 our retail property portfolio consisted of 1404 properties located in 48 states leased to 85 retail chains doing business in 28 industry segments each of the 28 industry segments represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for less than 165 of our rental revenue for the quarter ended december 31 2003 

  

•   management specialization   we believe that our management’s specialization in singletenant retail properties operated under netlease agreements is important to meeting our objectives we plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train highquality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership finance and management 

  

•   technology   we intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to efficiently and economically carry out our operations we maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio’s performance and actively manage our investments we believe that technology and informationbased systems will play an increasingly important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants 

  

  

properties 

  

at december 31 2003 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

•   of 1404 retail properties 

•   with an occupancy rate of 981 or 1378 properties occupied of the 1404 properties in the portfolio 

•   leased to 85 different retail chains doing business in 28 separate retail industries 

•   located in 48 states 

•   with over 113 million square feet of leasable space and 

•   with an average leasable retail space of 8100 square feet 

  

in addition to our real estate portfolio at december 31 2003 our subsidiary crest net had invested 533 million in a portfolio of 37 retail properties located in 13 states these properties are held for sale 

  

at december 31 2003 1374 or 979 of our 1404 retail properties were owned under netlease agreements net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes insurance and maintenance in addition tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases generally subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level 

  

our netleased retail properties primarily are leased to regional and national retail chain store operators most buildings are singlestory structures with adequate parking on site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods the properties tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic counts and adequate access and proximity to a sufficient population base to constitute a suitable market or trade area for the retailer’s business

description of leasing structure 

  

at december 31 2003 1374 or 979 of our 1404 properties were net leased in most cases the leases 

•   are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years 

•   require the tenants to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses taxes insurance and maintenance and 

•   provide for future rent increases typically subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index fixed increases or additional rent based upon the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level where leases provide for rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index generally these increases become part of the new permanent base rent where leases provide for percentage rent this additional rent is typically payable only if the tenants’ gross sales for a given period usually one year exceed a specified level and is then typically calculated as a percentage of only the amount of gross sales in excess of that level 

  

matters pertaining to certain properties and tenants 

  

of the 26 properties available for lease or sale at december 31 2003 all but one are singletenant properties seventeen of the properties had been previously leased to child care operators five to restaurant operators one to a home improvement operator one to an automotive service operator one to a grocery store operator and one to a shoe store operator at december 31 2003 19 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current with their rent and other obligations 

  

for 2003 our largest tenant was children’s world learning centers operates child care facilities and it accounted for 82 of our rental revenue and operates child care facilities however as a result of acquisitions during 2003 the pantry inc an operator of convenience stores was our largest tenant at december 31 2003 based on annualized rental revenue at december 31 2003 the pantry inc accounted for 78 of our annualized rental revenue and children’s world accounted for 73 of our annualized rental revenue annualized rental revenue is calculated by multiplying the monthly contractual base rent for each of the properties by 12 and adding the previous 12 month’s historic percentage rent excluding properties owned by crest net 

  

in general a downturn in the industries represented by these tenants whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect tenants in these industries which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations ability to make distributions to stockholders and our ability to make debt service payments in addition a substantial number of our properties are leased to middlemarket retail chains that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail chains and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective business or in the regional or national economy in general 

  

our tenants in the child care convenience store and restaurant industries accounted for approximately 178 133 and 118 respectively of our rental revenue for the year 2003 based on annualized rental revenue at december 31 2003 tenants in the child care convenience store and restaurant industries accounted for approximately 153 159 and 105 respectively individually each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10 of our rental revenue or annualized rental revenue 

  

a downturn in any of these industries whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely affect tenants in these industries which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations ability to make distributions to stockholders and our ability to make debt service payments 

  

 

certain properties under development 

  

of the 242 properties realty income acquired in 2003 and the 60 properties acquired by crest net in 2003 all but four were occupied at february 16 2004 the four properties were leased and under construction pursuant to a contract under which the tenant has agreed to develop the properties with development costs funded by us or crest net with rent commencing when the premises open for business in the case of development properties we either enter into an agreement with a retail chain where the retailer retains a contractor to construct the improvements and we fund the costs of that development or we fund a developer who constructs the improvements in either case there is an executed lease at the time of the land purchase and there is a requirement to complete the construction in a timely basis generally within eight months after we purchase the land the tenant or developer generally is required to pay construction cost overruns to the extent that they exceed the construction budget by more than a predetermined amount we also enter into a lease with the tenant at the time we purchase the land which generally requires the tenant to begin paying base rent when the store opens for business the base rent is calculated as a percentage of our acquisition cost for the property including construction costs and capitalized interest in 2003 realty income acquired eight development properties and crest net acquired two development properties six of which have been completed were operating and generating rent as of february 16 2004 both realty income and crest net will continue to pursue development opportunities under similar arrangements 

  

other items 

  

competition for acquisition of real estate 

  

we face competition in the acquisition operation and sale of property we expect competition from 

•   businesses 

•   individuals 

•   fiduciary accounts and plans and 

•   other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing 

  

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase 

  

the tenants leasing our properties can face significant competition from other operators this competition may adversely impact 

  

•   that portion if any of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a tenant’s revenues and 

•   the tenants’ results of operations or financial condition 

  

environmental liabilities 

  

investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property we can face such liability regardless of 

  

•   our knowledge of the contamination 

•   the timing of the contamination 

•   the cause of the contamination or 

•   the party responsible for the contamination of the property 

  

there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleumbased fuels as well as oil change and tuneup facilities these facilities or other of our properties use or may have used in the past underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or waste products which could create a potential for release of hazardous substances 

  

 

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest there also can be no assurance that our tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the leases the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or our ability to make distributions to stockholders 

  

we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest 

  

since december 1996 we have maintained an environmental insurance policy on our property portfolio the limit on our current policy is 10 million per occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 25000 self insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a 100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties it is possible that our insurance will be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that we could be unable to continue to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all in the future 

  

taxation of the company 

  

commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 we believe that we are organized and have operated and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a “reit” under sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

  

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 

  

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

  

if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

  

•   we would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

•   we would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed to our stockholders 

•   we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 

•   we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and 

•   this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved 

  

 

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we are subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a 100 tax our subsidiary crest net is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property 

  

effect of distribution requirements 

  

to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital gains each year 

  

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years 

  

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to reduce exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

  

dilution of common stock 

  

our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock likewise our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of our common stock 

  

real estate ownership risks 

  

we are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk that rental revenue from the properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our stock additional real estate ownership risks include 

  

•   adverse changes in general or local economic conditions 

•   changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties 

•   changes in interest rates and operating expenses 

•   competition for tenants 

•   changes in market rental rates 

•   inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases 

•   renewal of leases at lower rental rates 

•   inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship including bankruptcy 

•   changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate 

•   uninsured property liability 

•   property damage or casualty losses 

•   unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws 

•   acts of terrorism and war and 

•   acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management 

  

 

dependence on key personnel 

  

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company ® is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust commonly referred to as a reit our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations or ffo per share over the past 35 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under longterm primarily 15 to 20 year lease agreements the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from 1404 retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains 

  

we also seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties at december 31 2003 we owned a diversified portfolio 

  

•   of 1404 retail properties 

•   with an occupancy rate of 981 or 1378 properties occupied of the 1404 properties in the portfolio 

•   leased to 85 different retail chains doing business in 28 separate retail industries 

•   located in 48 states 

•   with over 113 million square feet of leasable space and 

•   with an average leasable retail space of 8100 square feet 

  

of the 1404 properties in the portfolio 1399 or 996 are singletenant retail properties and the remaining five are multitenant properties as of december 31 2003 1374 or 982 of the 1399 singletenant properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately 118 years 

  

in addition to our real estate portfolio at december 31 2003 our whollyowned subsidiary crest net lease inc had invested 533 million in a portfolio of 37 retail properties located in 13 states these properties are held for sale 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash reserves 

  

realty income is organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital at december 31 2003 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 48 million 

  

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility 

  

250 million bank credit facility 

  

we have a 250 million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires in october 2005 realty income’s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing under the 250 million credit facility at the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus 90 basis points with a facility fee of 20 basis points for allin drawn pricing of 110 basis points over libor at february 16 2004 we had a 

  

  

borrowing capacity of 2370 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of 130 million at an effective interest rate of 20 

  

the credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 

  

universal shelf registration of 500 million  

  

in december 2002 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec registering the issuance of up to 500 million in aggregate value of common stock preferred stock and debt securities this registration statement was declared effective by the sec in january 2003 at february 16 2004 1333 million remained available for issuance under our universal shelf registration statement 

  

issuances of common stock in 2003  

  

in october 2003 we issued 2875000 shares of common stock at a price of 4059 per share the net proceeds of 1108 million were used to repay borrowings under our 250 million acquisition credit facility 

  

conservative capital structure  

  

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at february 13 2004 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 4930 million or approximately 222 of our total market capitalization of 222 billion we define our total market capitalization at february 13 2004 as the sum of 

  

•   shares of our common stock outstanding of 38006034 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of 4285 per share or 163 billion 

•   liquidation value of the class b preferred stock of 686 million 

•   liquidation value of the class c preferred stock of 345 million 

•   outstanding borrowings of 130 million on our credit facility and 

•   outstanding notes of 4800 million 

  

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes over the long term we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us

all of these notes contain various covenants including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause the our debt to total assets ratio to exceed 60 ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total assets ratio to exceed 40 iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 15 times and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150 of our outstanding unsecured debt we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were issued as of february 16 2004 our credit facility balance was 130 million and our notes outstanding totaled 480 million

preferred stock outstanding 

  

in may 1999 we issued 2760000 shares of 938 class b cumulative redeemable preferred stock the “class b preferred” of which 2745700 shares were outstanding during 2003 and 2002 beginning may 25 2004 the class b preferred shares are redeemable at our option for 2500 per share dividends on the class b preferred are paid quarterly in arrears 

  

in july 1999 we issued 1380000 shares of 912 class c cumulative redeemable preferred stock the “class c preferred” all of which were outstanding during 2003 and 2002 beginning july 30 2004 the class c preferred shares are redeemable at our option for 2500 per share dividends on the class c preferred are paid monthly in arrears 

  

no offbalance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investment 

  

realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or offbalance sheet investments in “variable interest entities” or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 

  

as we have no joint ventures offbalance sheet entities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock our financial position or results of operations are currently not effected by financial accounting standard board interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities and statement of financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 

  

acquisitions during 2003 

  

realty income and crest net 

  

realty income and crest net invested 3716 million in aggregate in 302 new properties and properties under development in 2003 these 302 properties are located in 25 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease length of 199 years 

  

realty income 

  

realty income invested 2840 million in 242 new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 98 in 2003 these 242 properties are located in 20 states and are 100 leased with an initial average lease length of 199 years and will contain approximately 15 million leasable square feet 

  

included in the investments of real estate by realty income in 2003 is 131 million invested in properties acquired before 2003 that were under development estimated unfunded development costs on realty income and crest net properties under development at december 31 2003 totaled 83 million at dec ember 31 2003 eight new properties acquired during 2003 were leased and under development pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to develop the properties with development costs funded by realty income or crest net with rent scheduled to begin at various times during the first nine months of 2004 

  

the initial weighted average contractual lease rate on our investments is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a netleased property this is equal to the base rent or in the case of properties under development the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

  

the 242 new properties acquired by realty income are netleased to 15 different retail chains in ten industries automotive collision service automotive service automotive tire service convenience store equipment rental service grocery store home improvement restaurant sporting goods and travel plaza during 2003 we added two new industries equipment rental service and travel plaza to our portfolio we also segregated the 

  

 

automotive tire service industry from the automotive parts industry this segregation was made to reflect the different economic characteristics of the two industries 

  

crest net 

  

crest net invested 876 million during 2003 in 60 new retail properties and properties under development 

  

investments in existing properties 

  

in 2003 we capitalized costs of 656000 on existing properties in our portfolio consisting of 392000 for releasing costs and 264000 for building improvements 

  

sales of investment properties 

  

during 2003 we sold 35 properties and exchanged excess land parcels from three properties for an aggregate of 231 million which resulted in a gain of 65 million the 35 properties sold consisted of 19 child care facilities nine restaurants three home improvement stores two auto services location one consumer electronics store and one other property the land exchanges were on three convenience store locations these gains are included in discontinued operations the net proceeds from the sale of these properties were or will be used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility and to invest in new properties 

  

crest net property sales 

  

during 2003 crest net our whollyowned subsidiary sold 27 properties from its inventory for 452 million which resulted in a gain of 62 million 

  

crest net’s property inventory 

  

crest net’s property inventory at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 totaled 533 million and 46 million respectively and is included in real estate held for sale net on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

the financial statements of crest net are consolidated into realty income’s financial statements all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

increase in monthly distributions to common stockholders 

  

we continue our 34year policy of paying distributions monthly monthly distributions per share were increased by 000125 in april 2003 to 019625 in july 2003 to 01975 in october 2003 to 019875 and in january 2004 to 020 the increase in january 2004 was our 25 th consecutive quarterly increase and 27 th increase since our listing in 1994 on the new york stock exchange in december 2003 january 2004 and february 2004 we declared distributions of 020 per share which were paid on january 15 2004 february 17 2004 and payable on march 15 2004 respectively 

  

the monthly distribution of 020 per common share represents a current annualized distribution of 240 per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 59 based on a closing price on february 13 2004 of 4285 although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share or what the actual distribution yield will be for any future period 

  

credit ratings upgrades 

  

in november 2003 our credit ratings were upgraded by standard  poor’s ratings group our senior unsecured debt rating was raised to bbb from bbb and our preferred stock rating was raised to bbb from bb with a stable outlook 

  

in february 2003 our credit ratings were upgraded by moody’s investors service our senior unsecured debt rating was raised to baa2 from baa3 and our preferred stock rating was raised to baa3 from ba1 with a stable 

  

 

outlook 

  

stock and senior debt purchase program 

  

in january 2000 our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 10 million of our outstanding common and preferred shares and senior debt securities from time to time since january 2000 we concluded that our share price justified purchasing shares since this provided an attractive return on our investment capital we have purchased an aggregate of 67 million of our securities in 2000 and 2001 we did not purchase any of our securities in 2002 or 2003 but may do so from time to time in the future 

  

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations completing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

  

in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by generally accepted accounting principles many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting polices one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties depreciation of buildings and improvements is computed using the straight—line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life no depreciation has been recorded on crest net’s properties because they are held for sale 

  

another significant judgment that must be made is the impairment losses taken on our properties when events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable generally a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset if a property is held for sale it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet if events should occur that required us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

 

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

rental revenue 

  

rental revenue was 1493 million for 2003 versus 1339 million for 2002 an increase of 154 million or 115 rental revenue was 1159 million in 2001 the increase in rental revenue in 2003 compared to 2002 is attributable to 

  

•   the 242 retail properties acquired in 2003 by realty income which generated revenue of 76 million 

•   the 108 retail properties acquired in 2002 by realty income which generated revenue of 135 million in 2003 compared to 64 million in 2002 an increase of 71 million 

•   same store rents generated on 1003 leased properties owned in all of both 2003 and 2002 increased by 11 million or 09 to 1222 million from 1211 million 

•   properties owned by crest net which generated revenue of 17 million in 2003 compared to 14 million in 2002 an increase of 03 million 

•   development properties acquired before 2002 that started paying rent in 2002 properties that were vacant during part of 2003 or 2002 and lease termination settlements generated revenue of 45 million in 2003 as compared to 46 million in 2002 a decrease of 01 million and 

•   a decrease in straightline rent of 421000 in 2003 as compared to 2002 

  

we anticipate that our rental revenue from the 242 properties acquired in 2003 will increase significantly in 2004 since the majority of these properties were acquired in the fourth quarter 

  

of the 1404 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2003 1399 or 996 are singletenant properties and the remaining properties are multitenant properties of the 1399 singletenant properties 1374 or 982 were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately 118 years at december 31 2003 of our 1374 leased singletenant properties 1301 or 947 were under leases that provide for increases in rents through 

  

•   base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings 

•   overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales 

•   fixed increases or 

•   a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 

  

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 12 million in 2003 15 million in 2002 and 16 million in 2001 percentage rent in 2003 was less than 1 of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1 of rental revenue in 2004 

  

our portfolio of retail real estate leased primarily under net leases to regional and national chains continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders at december 31 2003 our portfolio of 1404 retail properties was 981 leased with 26 properties available for lease transactions to lease or sell 12 of the 26 properties available for lease or sale at december 31 2003 were underway or completed as of february 10 2004 we anticipate these transactions to be completed during the next six months although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be sold or leased within this period it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 3 of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time however we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 

  

gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale by crest net 

  

in 2003 crest net sold 27 properties for 452 million which resulted in a gain of 62 million in 2002 crest net sold 23 properties for 273 million which resulted in a gain of 35 million in 2001 crest net sold nine properties for 289 million which resulted in a gain of 34 million all gains on sales of real estate acquired for resale are reported before income taxes 

  

 

at december 31 2003 crest net had invested 533 million in 37 properties which are held for sale our goal is for crest net to carry an average inventory of 20 to 25 million in real estate crest net’s level of inventory increased substantially during the second half of 2003 crest net generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties it is our belief that at this level of inventory earnings will more than cover the ongoing expenses of crest net 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 34 million higher in 2003 than in 2002 primarily due to higher average outstanding balances the following is a summary of the five components of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

  

   

   

interest on outstanding credit facilities and notes increased by 37 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to higher average outstanding balances in 2002 unamortized fees of 406000 relating to our previous credit facilities which were canceled in october 2002 were charged to interest expense 

  

at february 16 2004 the weighted average interest rate on our 

  

•   credit facility borrowings of 130 million was 20 

•   notes payable of 480 million was 67 and 

•   combined outstanding credit facility and notes of 4930 million was 65 

  

interest coverage ratio 

  

our interest coverage ratio for 2003 was 53 times for 2002 it was 55 times and for 2001 it was 44 times interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated below divided by interest expense we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

 

the following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to our interest coverage amount dollars in thousands 

  

   

fixed charge coverage ratio 

  

our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2003 and 2002 was 39 times and for 2001 was 32 times fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited this information should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap liquidity measures 

  

interest coverage amount divided by interest expense plus preferred stock dividends dollars in thousands 

  

   

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization was 335 million in 2003 versus 301 million in 2002 and 277 million in 2001 the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of properties in 2003 2002 and 2001 which was partially offset by property sales in these years included in 2001 is 924000 of amortization expense related to goodwill 

  

general and administrative expenses 

  

general and administrative expenses increased by 17 million to 112 million in 2003 versus 95 million in 2002 general and administrative expenses in 2001 were 78 million in 2003 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 72 as compared to 69 in 2002 and 65 in 2001 included in general and administrative expenses are 566000 410000 and 496000 of expenses attributable to crest net in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively general and administrative expenses excluding expenses attributable to crest net increased primarily due to increases in corporate insurance payroll and staffing costs 

  

 

as our property portfolio has grown and continues to grow we have and anticipate that we will continue to increase the level of our staffing we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to costs attributable to payroll staffing costs and corporate governance we anticipate that our rental revenue will increase at a faster rate in 2004 than our general and administrative expenses 

  

we had 58 employees at february 16 2004 compared to 56 at march 1 2003 53 at march 1 2002 and 49 at march 1 2001 

  

property expenses 

  

property expenses are broken down into costs associated with nonnet leased multitenant properties unleased singletenant properties and general portfolio expenses expenses related to the multitenant and unleased singletenant properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2003 26 properties were available for lease as compared to 27 at december 31 2002 and 20 at december 31 2001 

  

property expenses were 26 million in 2003 25 million in 2002 and 23 million in 2001 the 100000 increase in property expenses in 2003 is primarily attributable to an increase in costs associated with vacant properties 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes increased 10 million to 27 million in 2003 as compared to 17 million in 2002 the increase in 2003 is due to an increase in crest net income taxes crest net taxes were higher in 2003 as compared to 2002 because crest net’s taxable net income was higher 

  

the following is a summary of our income taxes dollars in thousands 

  

   

gain on sales of investment properties by realty income 

  

in 2003 we sold or exchanged 35 properties for a total of 231 million and recognized a gain of 65 million this gain is included in discontinued operations in 2002 we sold or exchanged 35 properties for a total of 202 million and recognized a gain of 63 million of this gain 60 million is included in discontinued operations in 2001 we sold or exchanged 35 properties for a total of 395 million and recognized a gain of 105 million 

  

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2003 we classified real estate with a carrying amount of 601 million as held for sale which includes 533 million in properties owned by crest net additionally we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified we anticipate we will receive between 15 million and 35 million in proceeds from the sale of investment properties during the next 12 months and we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions however we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months 

  

 

discontinued operations  

  

the operations of seven properties listed as held for sale at december 31 2003 plus properties sold in 2002 and 2003 have been classified as discontinued operations 

  

the following is a summary of our discontinued operations for 2003 2002 and 2001 dollars in thousands 

  

   

provisions for impairment 

  

provisions for impairment of 570000 were taken in 2003 as compared to 13 million in 2002 these impairment losses are included in discontinued operations provisions for impairment of 15 million were taken in 2001 of which 70000 is included in discontinued operations 

  

preferred stock dividends  

  

we paid preferred stock dividends of 97 million in each of 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

net income available to common stockholders 

  

net income available to common stockholders in 2003 increased by 77 million or 112 to 767 million as compared to 690 million in 2002 net income available to common stockholders in 2001 was 578 million 

  

net income available to common stockholders includes gains and losses from the sale of investment properties the amount of gains and losses varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 

  

the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2003 was 65 million as compared to 63 million during 2002 and 105 million in 2001 

  

  

funds from operations ffo 

available to common stockholders 

  

ffo for 2003 increased by 103 million or 110 to 1040 million as compared to 937 million in 2002 the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure to ffo information regarding distributions paid and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for 2003 and 2002 dollars in thousands 

  

   

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust’s definition as net income available to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry reduced by gains and increased by losses on i sales of investment property and ii extraordinary items 

  

we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes noncash items such as depreciation the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure in addition ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 

  

presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of realty income’s performance in addition ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

  

  

other noncash items and capitalized expenditures 

  

the following information includes noncash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio these items are not utilized in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at funds from operations analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 

  

   

1 amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in may 1997 october 1998 january 1999 march 2003 and november 2003 these costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 

  

2 negative amounts represent that our straightline rent was more than our actual cash rent collected by the amounts indicated positive amounts represent that our straightline rent was less than our actual cash rent collected by the amounts indicated 

  

ffo generated by crest net 

  

crest net generated 46 million in ffo for realty income in 2003 27 million in 2002 and 24 million in 2001 as a result of the increase in crest net’s inventory we anticipate that crest net’s contributions to our ffo in the early quarters of 2004 may be more significant compared to the same quarters in 2003 the future contribution if any to our ffo by crest net will depend on the timing and the number of property acquisitions and sales it achieves if any in a given period the following is a calculation of crest net’s ffo contribution to realty income for 2003 and 2002 dollars in thousands 

  

   

impact of inflation 

  

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes increases in the consumer price index andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

  

approximately 979 or 1374 of the 1404 properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases 

  

 

where the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 

  

impact of accounting pronouncements 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued fin no 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of certain variable interest entities  fin no 46r requires consolidation of a variable interest entity by an enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest the impact of adopting fin no 46r is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and longterm notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we issue longterm notes primarily at fixed rates and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december 31 2003 we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

  

our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the following table presents the principal amounts weighted average interest rates fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in table in millions 

  

   

1 the credit facility expires in october 2005 the credit facility balance as of february 16 2004 was 130 million 

2 110 million matures in may 2007 

3 100 million matures in october 2008 

4 20 million matures in january 2009 100 million matures in march 2013 and 150 million matures in november 2015 

5 we base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december 31 2003 on the closing market price or indicative price per each note the fair value of the variable rate debt approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to those available in the market place 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2003 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

  

 




 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

we have had no disagreements with our independent auditors on accountancy or financial disclosure nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years 

  




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedure we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in securities exchange act 1934 rules 13a14c and 15d14c that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

within 90 days prior to the date of this annual report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

  

changes in internal controls there have not been any significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation there were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and therefore no corrective actions were taken

                               recent developments

issuance of common stock in july 2002 we issued 1550000 shares of common
stock at a price of 3340 per share the net proceeds of 489 million were
used to repay a portion of our 200 million acquisition credit facility

in february 2002 we issued 273150 shares of common stock to a unit investment
trust at a net price to us of 3026 per share based on a 5 discount to the
market price at the time of issuance of 3185 per share the net proceeds of
82 million were used to repay a portion of our 200 million acquisition credit
facility

new 250 million bank credit facility in october 2002 we entered into a new
250 million credit facility to replace our existing 200 million acquisition
credit facility and our 25 million credit facility each of which was scheduled
to expire in 2003 under the terms of the new credit facility total funds
available were increased by 25 million concurrent with the closing of the new
facility our previous credit facilities were canceled

universal shelf registration of 500 million in december 2002 we filed a
universal shelf registration statement with the sec covering up to 500 million
in value of common stock preferred stock and debt securities this registration
statement was declared effective by the sec in january 2003 through march 1
2003 we have not issued any securities under the universal shelf registration
statement

property acquisitions in 2002 we acquired 108 properties the new
properties located in 24 states in 2002 we invested 1333 million in the
new properties and properties under development excluding estimated unfunded
development costs at december 31 2002 of 93 million and investments by crest
net

the initial weighted average annual unleveraged return on the 1333 million
invested in 2002 is estimated to be 104 computed as estimated contractual net
operating income which in the case of a netleased property is equal to the
base rent or in the case of properties under construction the estimated base
rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated
total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of
contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentage listed above

the new properties are expected to contain approximately 719800 leasable square
feet and are 100 leased under net leases with an average initial lease term of
198 years as of december 31 2002 six of the new properties were leased and
under construction pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to
develop the properties with development costs funded by realty income and with
rent scheduled to begin in 2003

funds from operations ffo in 2002 our ffo increased by 173 million or
222 to 951 million versus 778 million in 2001 see our discussion of ffo
in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations in this annual report which includes a
reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo

in 2002 crest net generated 27 million in ffo for realty income the future
contribution if any to our ffo by crest net will depend on the timing and the
number of property sales it achieves if any in a given year

crest net we created crest net in january 2000 to buy own and sell properties
primarily to buyers using taxdeferred exchanges under section 1031 of the
internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code realty income owns 100
of crest nets stock the financial statements of crest net are consolidated
into realty incomes financial statements all material intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation

in 2002 crest net invested 61 million in three retail properties and
properties under development these three new properties are expected to contain
approximately 13200 leasable square feet are 100 leased and have initial
lease terms averaging 184 years two of these properties were sold in 2002



                                       6

in 2002 crest net sold 23 properties for 273 million and realty income
recorded a gain of 35 million before income taxes at the end of 2002 crest
net carried an inventory of 46 million which is included on realty incomes
consolidated balance sheet in real estate held for sale net

sales of investment properties in 2002 we sold or exchanged 35 properties for
a total of 202 million and recognized a gain of 63 million of this gain
60 million is included in income from discontinued operations

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate
higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or
extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2002 we classified
real estate with a carrying amount of 65 million as held for sale which
includes 46 million in properties owned by crest net additionally we
anticipate selling properties from our portfolio that have not yet been
specifically identified we anticipate we will receive between 15 million and
30 million in proceeds from the sale of properties during the next 12 months
we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions

increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders we continue our
33year policy of paying distributions monthly in the past 12 months we
increased monthly distributions per share by 000125 on four separate
occasions in april 2002 the increase per share was to 019125 in july 2002 to
01925 in october 2002 to 019375 and in january 2003 to 0195 the increase
in january 2003 was our 21st consecutive quarterly increase and 23rd increase in
the amount of our dividend since the companys listing on the nyse in 1994 in
2002 we paid 12 monthly cash distributions per share three in the amount of
019 three in the amount of 019125 three in the amount of 01925 and
three in the amount of 019375 totaling 23025 per share in december 2002
january 2003 and february 2003 we declared distributions of 0195 per share
which were paid on january 15 2003 and february 18 2003 and will be paid on
march 17 2003 respectively

the monthly distribution of 0195 per share represents a current annualized
distribution of 234 per share and an annualized distribution yield of
approximately 68 based on the last reported sale price of the companys common
stock on the nyse of 3466 on march 1 2003 although we expect to continue our
policy of paying monthly distributions we cannot guarantee that we will
maintain the current level of distributions that we will continue our pattern
of increasing distributions per share or what the actual distribution yield
will be for any future period


                               distribution policy

distributions are paid to our common stockholders and class c preferred
stockholders on a monthly basis and are paid to our class b preferred
stockholders on a quarterly basis if as and when declared by our board of
directors the class b preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions
at a rate of 9375 per annum on the 25 per share liquidation preference
equivalent to 234375 per annum per share the class c preferred stockholders
receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 95 per annum on the 25 per
share liquidation preference equivalent to 2375 per annum per share

in order to maintain our tax status as a reit for federal income tax purposes
we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders
aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without
regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains and
we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our
reit taxable income including net capital gains in 2002 our distributions
totaled approximately 1069 of our estimated reit taxable income our estimated
reit taxable income reflects noncash deductions for depreciation and
amortization we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders
that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce
our exposure to income taxes our 2002 distributions to common stockholders were
821 of our funds from operations


                                       7
page


our future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and
will depend on among other things our results of operations ffo financial
condition and capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under
the reit provisions of the code our debt service requirements and other factors
as the board of directors may deem relevant in addition our credit facility
contains financial covenants which could limit the amount of distributions
payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or
financial condition and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the
common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due subject to
any applicable grace period any principal or interest on borrowings under our
credit facility

distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal
income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary
income except to the extent we recognize capital gains and declare a capital
gains dividend distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will
be treated as a nontaxable reduction in the stockholders basis in the stock
distributions above that basis generally will be treated as a capital gain
approximately 58 of the distributions made or deemed to have been made in 2002
to our common stockholders were classified as a return of capital for federal
income tax purposes we are unable to predict the portion of future
distributions that may be classified as a return of capital


                        business philosophy and strategy

investment philosophy we believe that the longterm ownership of an actively
managed diversified portfolio of retail properties under longterm netlease
agreements produces consistent predictable income under a netlease
agreement the tenant agrees to pay monthly rent and property operating expenses
taxes maintenance and insurance plus typically future rent increases
generally subject to ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index
fixed increases or additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants
gross sales above a specified level we believe that longterm leases coupled
with the tenants responsibility for property expenses generally produce a more
predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios while
continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income

investment strategy in identifying new properties for acquisition our focus is
on providing expansion capital to retail chains by acquiring then leasing back
their retail store locations we categorize retail tenants as 1 venture
market 2 middle market and 3 upper market venture companies typically offer
a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between
five and 50 retail outlets middle market retail chains typically have 50 to 500
retail outlets operations in more than one geographic region have been
successful through one or more economic cycles and have a proven replicable
concept the upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500
or more stores operating nationally in a proven mature retail concept upper
market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to
several sources of capital

realty income primarily focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market
retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because

o    they generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial
     obstacles that can adversely affect venture retailers
o    they typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited
     financing options
o    they generally have provided us with attractive riskadjusted returns over
     time since their financial strength has in many cases tended to improve
     as their businesses have matured
o    their relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across
     a greater number of stores and
o    middle market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a
     number of locations are closed due to underperformance


                                       8
page


we also focus on and have selectively made investments in properties of upper
market retail chains we believe upper market retail chains can be attractive
for investment because

o    they typically are of a higher credit quality
o    they usually are larger brand name public and private retailers
o    they utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10000 to 50000 square
     feet and
o    they are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger
     transaction sizes

while our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased
to middle and upper market retail chains we also selectively seek investment
opportunities with venture market retail chains periodically venture market
opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is
high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices to meet our stringent
investment standards however venture retail companies must have a welldefined
retailing concept and strong financial prospects these opportunities are
examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in making
investments in this area

historically our investment focus has been on retail industries that have a
service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of
businesses is more stable because of this investment focus at december 31
2002 approximately 76 of our annualized rent as the term is used on page 13
is derived from retailers with a service component in their business
furthermore we believe these serviceoriented businesses would be difficult to
duplicate over the internet and that our properties continue to perform well
relative to competition from internet businesses

credit strategy we generally provide saleleaseback financing primarily to less
than investment grade retail chains from 1970 through december 31 2002 we
have acquired and leased back to regional and national retail chains 1266
properties including 116 properties that have been sold and have collected
approximately 98 of the original contractual rent obligations on those
properties we believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive
riskadjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers

we believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically
include their bank and other debt payment obligations to suppliers and real
estate lease obligations because we own the land and building in which a tenant
conducts its retail business we believe the risk of default on a retailers
lease obligations is less than the retailers unsecured general obligations it
has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail
locations in order to survive in the event of reorganization they are less
likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate
their right to use the property thus as the property owner we believe we will
fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of
reorganization if a property is rejected by the tenant during a reorganization
we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the
property in addition we believe that the risk of default on the real estate
leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers
individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are
weaker performers

in order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio new property acquisitions
must meet stringent investment and credit requirements the properties must
generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile
we have established a threepart analysis that examines each potential
investment based on

o    industry company market conditions and credit profile
o    location profitability if profitability data is available and
o    overall real estate characteristics including value and comparative rental
     rates

the standard profile of companies whose properties have been approved for
acquisition generally are those with 50 or more retail stores that are located
in highly visible areas with easy access to major thoroughfares and attractive
demographics


                                       9

acquisition strategy we seek to invest in industries in which several
wellorganized regional and national chains are capturing market share through
service quality control economies of scale mass media advertising and the
selection of prime retail locations we execute our acquisition strategy by
acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain stores in a
variety of industries by acquiring then leasing back their retail store
locations we undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate
industries tenants and property locations for investment our research
expertise is instrumental to uncovering netlease opportunities in markets where
our real estate financing program adds value in selecting real estate for
potential investment we generally seek to acquire properties that have the
following characteristics

o    freestanding commerciallyzoned property with a single tenant
o    properties that are important retail locations for regional and national
     retail chains
o    properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to
     the business of their tenants with high visibility and easy access to
     major thoroughfares and
o    properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or
     assumption of longterm netlease agreements offering both current income
     and the potential for rent increases

portfolio management strategy the active management of the property portfolio
is an essential component of our longterm strategy we continually monitor our
portfolio for changes that could affect the performance of the industries
tenants and locations in which we have invested the portfolio is regularly
analyzed with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit
quality company executives review industry research tenant research property
due diligence and significant portfolio management activities this monitoring
typically includes regular review and analysis of

o    the performance of various retail industries
o    the operation management business planning and financial condition of the
     tenants and
o    the health of the individual markets in which we own properties from both
     an economic and real estate standpoint

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate
higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or
extend our average remaining lease terms at december 31 2002 we classified
real estate with a carrying amount of 65 million as held for sale of this
amount real estate owned by crest net totaled 46 million additionally we
anticipate selling properties from our portfolio which have not yet been
specifically identified we anticipate receiving between 15 million and
30 million in proceeds from the sale of properties during the next 12 months
we intend to invest these proceeds into new retail properties

capital markets strategy we believe our stockholders are best served by a
conservative capital structure at march 1 2003 our total outstanding credit
facility borrowings and outstanding notes were 3371 million or approximately
204 of our total market capitalization of 165 billion we define our total
market capitalization as the sum of

o    the shares of our common stock outstanding multiplied by the last reported
     sales price of the common stock on the nyse on march 1 2003 of 3466 per
     share
o    the liquidation value of the class b preferred stock
o    the liquidation value of the class c preferred stock and
o    outstanding borrowings on the credit facility and outstanding notes at
     march 1 2003

we have a 250 million revolving unsecured acquisition credit facility that
expires in october 2005 at march 1 2003 the outstanding balance on the
acquisition credit facility was 1071 million with an effective interest rate
of approximately 24 a commitment fee of 02 per annum accrues on the total
credit commitment of the credit facility the credit facility has been and is
expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties leased to regional
and national retail chains under longterm netlease agreements the credit
facility has also been used to provide capital to subsidiaries for the purpose
of funding the acquisition of properties



                                       10
page


we use our credit facility for the shortterm financing of new property
acquisitions when outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a
certain level generally in the range of 75 to 175 million and capital is
available on acceptable terms we generally seek to refinance those borrowings
with the net proceeds of longterm or permanent financing which may include the
issuance of common stock preferred stock convertible preferred stock debt
securities or convertible debt securities we cannot assure you however that
we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions
prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt
securities upon acceptable terms

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of
common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes over the longterm
we believe that the majority of our future issuances of securities should be in
the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or
debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe
that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering
to be invested on an accretive basis into additional properties in addition we
may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed
using our credit facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that
we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us

we currently are assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our
senior unsecured notes from fitch ratings moodys investors service and
standard  poors ratings group currently fitch has assigned a rating of bbb
moodys has assigned a rating of baa2 and standard  poors has assigned a
rating of bbb to our senior notes these ratings could change based upon among
other things our results of operations and financial condition

we also have received credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our
preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moodys investors
service has assigned a rating of baa3 and standard  poors ratings group has
assigned a rating of bb these ratings could change based upon among other
things our results of operations and financial condition

realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated investments in
special purpose entities variable interest entities or offbalance sheet
financing nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity
contracts or other derivative instruments

competitive strategy we believe that to successfully pursue our investment
philosophy and strategy we must seek to maintain the following competitive
advantages

o    size and type of investment properties we believe smaller 500000 to
     10000000 netleased retail properties represent an attractive
     investment opportunity in todays real estate environment due to the
     complexities of acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively
     small assets we believe these types of properties have not experienced
     significant institutional ownership interest or the corresponding yield
     reduction experienced by larger incomeproducing properties we believe the
     less intensive daytoday property management required by netlease
     agreements coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of
     smaller properties is an effective investment strategy the tenants of our
     freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and services that
     satisfy basic consumer needs in order to grow and expand they generally
     need capital since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single
     largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers our method of
     purchasing the property and then leasing it back under a netlease
     arrangement allows the retail chain to free up capital

o    investment in new retail industries though we specialize in singletenant
     properties we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety
     of retail industries we believe diversification will allow us to invest in
     retail industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we
     find attractive these characteristics include but are not limited to
     retail industries dominated by local store operators where regional and
     national chain store operators can increase market share and dominance
     through consolidation and more efficient operations as well as take
     advantage of major demographic shifts in the population base



                                       11

o    diversification diversification of the portfolio by retail industry type
     tenant and geographic location is key to our objective of providing
     predictable investment results for our stockholders further
     diversification of our portfolio is an objective of the company at
     december 31 2002 our retail property portfolio consisted of 1197
     properties located in 48 states leased to 79 retail chains doing business
     in 25 industry segments at december 31 2002 all industry segments in our
     property portfolio comprise less than 20 of our annualized rent

o    management specialization we believe that our managements specialization
     in singletenant retail properties operated under netlease agreements is
     important to meeting our objectives we plan to maintain this
     specialization and will seek to employ and train highquality professionals
     in this specialized area of real estate ownership finance and management

o    technology we intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts
     to efficiently and economically carry out our operations we maintain
     sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolios
     performance and actively manage our investments we believe that technology
     and informationbased systems will play an increasingly important role in
     our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a
     variety of industries and tenants


                                   properties

at december 31 2002 we owned a diversified portfolio

o    of 1197 retail properties
o    with an occupancy rate of 977 or 1170 properties occupied of the 1197
     properties in the portfolio
o    leased to 79 different retail chains

rent as of december 31 2002 for each of the properties by 12 and adding the
previous 12 months historic percentage rent which totaled 16 million ie
additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants gross sales above a
specified level for the properties under construction an estimated
contractual base rent based upon the estimated total costs of each property is
used

description of leasing structure at december 31 2002 1165 or 973 of the
companys 1197 properties were leased pursuant to net leases in most cases
the leases

o    were for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with the tenants having one or
     more options to extend the initial term
o    require the tenants to pay property taxes insurance and expenses of
     maintaining the property
o    provide for a minimum base rent plus future increases typically subject to
     ceilings based on increases in the consumer price index additional rent
     based upon the tenants gross sales above a specified level ie
     percentage rent or fixed increases where leases provide for rent
     increases based on increases in the consumer price index generally these
     increases permanently become part of the base rent where leases provide
     for percentage rent this additional rent is typically payable only if the
     tenants gross sales for a given period usually one year exceed a
     specified level and then is typically calculated as a percentage of only
     the amount of gross sales in excess of that level

matters pertaining to certain properties and tenants twentyseven of our
properties were available for sale or lease at december 31 2002 all of which
are singletenant properties sixteen of the properties had been previously
leased to child care operators six to restaurant operators three to home
improvement operators one to an automotive service operator and one to a health
care operator at december 31 2002 14 of our properties under lease were
unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants all of which were current
with their rent and other obligations

our largest tenant childrens world learning centers accounted for
approximately 107 of our rental revenue in 2002 no other tenant comprised 9
or more of our rental revenue at december 31 2002 as a result of portfolio
growth through acquisitions during the year childrens world learning centers
accounted for approximately 99 of our annualized rent annualized rent is
calculated by multiplying the monthly contractual base rent for each of the
properties by 12 and adding the previous 12 months historic percentage rent
excluding properties owned by crest net in general a downturn in the industry
represented by this tenant whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of
the united states could adversely affect tenants in this industry which in
turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of
operations ability to make distributions to stockholders and our ability to
make debt service payments in addition a substantial number of our properties
are leased to middlemarket retail chains that generally have more limited
financial and other resources than certain uppermarket retail chains and
therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their
respective business or in the regional or national economy in general

our tenants in the child care and restaurant industries accounted for
approximately 208 and 135 respectively of our rental revenue for the year
ended december 31 2002 a downturn in either of these industries whether
nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the united states could adversely
affect tenants in those industries which in turn could have a material adverse
affect on our financial position results of operations ability to make
distributions to stockholders and our ability to make debt service payments at
december 31 2002 all industry segments in our property portfolio comprise less
than 20 of our annualized rent

development of certain properties of the 108 properties we acquired in 2002 and
three properties acquired by crest net in 2002 all but five were occupied at
march 1 2003 the five properties were leased and under construction pursuant
to a contract under which the tenant has agreed to develop the properties with
development costs funded by us or crest net with rent commencing when the
premises open for business in the case of development properties we either
enter into an agreement with a retail chain where the retailer retains a
contractor to construct the improvements and we fund the costs of that
development or we fund a developer who constructs the improvements in either
case there is an executed lease at the time of the land purchase and there is a
requirement to complete the construction on a timely basis generally within


                                       17
page


eight months after we purchase the land the tenant or developer generally is
required to pay construction cost overruns to the extent they exceed the
construction budget by more than a predetermined amount we also enter into a
lease with the tenant at the time we purchase the land which generally requires
the tenant to begin paying base rent calculated as a percentage of our
acquisition cost for the property including construction costs and capitalized
interest when the premises opens for business in 2002 we acquired nine
development properties and crest net acquired two development properties six
of which have been completed were operating and generating rent as of march 1
2003 both realty income and crest net will continue to pursue development
opportunities under similar arrangements


                                   other items

competition for acquisition of real estate  we face competition in the
acquisition operation and sale of property  we expect competition from

o    businesses
o    individuals
o    fiduciary accounts and plans and
o    other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing

some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial
resources this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish
to purchase

the tenants leasing our properties can face significant competition from other
operators this competition may adversely impact

o    that portion if any of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a
     tenants revenues and
o    the tenants results of operations or financial condition

environmental liabilities investments in real property can create a potential
for environmental liability an owner of property can face liability for
environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous
substances on the property we face such liability regardless of

o    our knowledge of the contamination
o    the timing of the contamination
o    the cause of the contamination or
o    the party responsible for the contamination of the property

there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we
are unaware in that regard a number of our properties are leased to operators
of oil change and tuneup facilities and convenience stores that sell
petroleumbased fuels these facilities or other of our properties use or may
have used in the past underground tanks for the storage of petroleumbased or
waste products which could create a potential for release of hazardous
substances

the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our
ability to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs
although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with
all applicable federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations and to
indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants
activities on the property we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability
by virtue of our ownership interest and there can be no assurance that our
tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the leases the
discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or our
ability to make distributions to stockholders

we have not been notified by any governmental authority and are not otherwise
aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to hazardous
substances toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our
present properties nevertheless if environmental contamination should exist
we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest

since december 1996 we have maintained an environmental insurance policy on our
property portfolio the limit on our current policy is 10 million per
occurrence and 50 million in the aggregate subject to a 25000 self insurance
retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a
100000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties it is
possible that our insurance will be insufficient to address any particular
environmental situation and that we will be unable to continue to obtain
insurance for environmental matters in the future at a reasonable cost or at
all

taxation of the company we believe that we are organized and have operated
commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1994 and we intend to
continue to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under
sections 856 through 860 of the code however we cannot assure you that we have
satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit that we will continue to
be organized as a reit or that we have been or will continue to be able to
operate in a manner so that we qualify or will remain qualified as a reit

qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under
highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited
judicial and administrative interpretations and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in
any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions
to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income as
defined in the code and determined without regard to the dividends paid
deduction and by excluding net capital gains

in the future it is possible that legislation new regulations administrative
interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to
qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of those
qualifications

if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year

o    we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable
     alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates
o    we would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for
     amounts distributed to our stockholders
o    we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable
     years following the year during which qualification is lost
o    we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders and
o    this treatment would substantially reduce our net earnings available for
     investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax
     liability for the years involved

even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status we are subject to certain
federal state and local taxes on our income and property for example if we
have net income from a prohibited transaction that income will be subject to a
100 tax our subsidiary crest net is subject to federal and state taxes at the
applicable tax rates on its income and property


                                       19

effect of distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for
federal income tax purposes we generally are required to distribute to our
stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard
to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year

we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we
distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income including net capital
gains each year

in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if
any of certain distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year if
those distributions are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that
calendar year 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any
amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years

we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with
the distribution requirements of the code and to reduce exposure to federal
income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax differences in timing between the
receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income along
with the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to
borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the distribution requirements that
are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit

dilution of common stock our future growth will depend in large part upon our
ability to raise additional capital if we were to raise additional capital
through the issuance of equity securities we could dilute the interests of
holders of our common stock likewise our board of directors is authorized to
cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend voting
and other rights as determined by the board of directors accordingly the
board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting
dividend and other similar rights that could dilute or otherwise adversely
affect the interests of holders of our common stock

real estate ownership risks we are subject to all of the general risks
associated with the ownership of real estate in particular we face the risk
that rental revenue from the properties may be insufficient to cover all
corporate operating expenses debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and
distributions on our stock additional real estate ownership risks include

o    adverse changes in general or local economic conditions
o    changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties
o    changes in interest rates and operating expenses
o    competition for tenants
o    changes in market rental rates
o    inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases
o    renewal of leases at lower rental rates
o    inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship
     including bankruptcy
o    changes in tax real estate zoning and environmental laws that may have an
     adverse impact upon the value of real estate
o    uninsured property liability
o    property damage or casualty losses
o    unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties
     into compliance with applicable federal state and local laws
o    acts of terrorism and war and
o    acts of god and other factors beyond the control of our management

dependence on key personnel we depend on the efforts of our executive officers
and key employees the loss of the services of our executive officers and key
employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations

         of operations
         

                                     general

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company r a maryland
corporation realty income the company our or we was organized to
operate as an equity real estate investment trust reit the companys
primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly distributions from
a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations ffo per share
over the past 33 years realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring
and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under
longterm primarily 15 to 20 year lease agreements the monthly distributions
are supported by the cash flow from 1197 retail properties leased to regional
and national retail chains

we also seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through
both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties
at december 31 2002 we owned a diversified portfolio

o    of 1197 retail properties
o    with an occupancy rate of 977 or 1170 properties occupied of the 1197
     properties in the portfolio
o    leased to 79 different retail chains
o    doing business in 25 separate retail industries
o    located in 48 states
o    with approximately 10 million square feet of leasable space and
o    with an average leasable retail space of 8400 square feet

of the 1197 properties in the portfolio 1192 or 996 are singletenant
retail properties with the remaining five being multitenant properties as of
december 31 2002 1165 or 977 of the 1192 singletenant properties were
leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension
options of approximately 109 years

in addition to our real estate portfolio at december 31 2002 our subsidiary
crest net lease inc crest net had invested 46 million in a portfolio of
four retail properties located in three states these properties are held for
sale

                         liquidity and capital resources

cash reserves realty income is organized to operate as an equity reit that
acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of
monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated
from leases on its retail properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount
of cash as working capital at december 31 2002 we had cash and cash
equivalents totaling 89 million

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from
operating activities and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity
needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources
of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility

new 250 million bank credit facility in october 2002 we entered into a new
250 million credit facility to replace our existing 200 million acquisition
credit facility and our 25 million credit facility each of which was scheduled
to expire during 2003 under the terms of the new credit facility total funds
available were increased by 25 million concurrent with the closing of the new
facility our previous credit facilities were canceled at march 1 2003 the
250 million credit facility had an outstanding balance of 1071 million

the borrowing rate on the new credit facility was reduced compared to the
previous credit facilities realty incomes current investment grade credit
ratings provide for financing at libor london interbank offered rate plus 90
basis points with a facility fee of 20 basis points for allin drawn pricing of
110 basis points over libor as compared to an allin pricing of 145 basis
points on our previous credit facilities the term of the new facility extends
through october 2005

the colead arranger and sole administrative agent for the credit facility is
wells fargo bank na with the bank of new york acting as colead arranger and
sole documentation agent they are joined by the bank of america na and
wachovia bank national association as cosyndication agents five other banks
are also participants in providing the credit facility amsouth bank bank of
montreal us bank national association bank one na and chevy chase bank
fsb

this credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail
properties leased to national and regional retail chains under longterm lease
agreements any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest
rate risk we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties

universal shelf registration of 500 million in december 2002 we filed a
universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange
commission sec covering up to 500 million in value of common stock
preferred stock and debt securities this registration statement was declared
effective by the sec in january 2003 through march 1 2003 we have not issued
any common stock preferred stock or debt securities under the universal shelf
registration statement

issuances of common stock in 2002 in july 2002 we issued 1550000 shares of
common stock at a price of 3340 per share the net proceeds of 489 million
were used to repay borrowings under our 200 million acquisition credit
facility

in february 2002 we issued 273150 shares of common stock to a unit investment
trust at a net price to us of 3026 per share based on a 5 discount to the
market price at the time of issuance of 3185 per share the net proceeds of
82 million were used to repay bank borrowings under our 200 million
acquisition credit facility

conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served
by a conservative capital structure therefore we seek to maintain a
conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge
coverage ratios at march 1 2003 our total outstanding credit facility
borrowings and outstanding notes were 3371 million or approximately 204 of
our total market capitalization of 165 billion we define our total market
capitalization as the sum of the

o    shares of our common stock outstanding multiplied by the last reported
     sales price of the common stock on the nyse on march 1 2003 of 3466 per
     share
o    liquidation value of the class b preferred stock
o    liquidation value of the class c preferred stock and
o    outstanding borrowings on the credit facility and outstanding notes at
     march 1 2003

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of
common stock preferred stock and longterm unsecured notes over the long term
we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the
form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or debt
securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe that our
share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be
accretively invested into additional properties in addition we may issue
common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit
facility or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we will have
access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us

no unconsolidated investments realty income and its subsidiaries have no
unconsolidated investments in special purpose entities variable interest
entities or offbalance sheet financing nor do we engage in trading
activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative

property acquisitions in 2002 we acquired 108 properties the new
properties located in 24 states and invested 1333 million in the new
properties and properties under development which includes investments of
35 million for properties acquired before 2002 we have committed to pay
estimated unfunded development costs of 93 million on properties under
construction at december 31 2002 in 2002 we capitalized 377000 for
releasing costs and 642000 for building improvements on existing properties
in our portfolio

the initial weighted average annual unleveraged return on the 1333 million
invested in 2002 is estimated to be 104 computed as estimated contractual net
operating income which in the case of a netleased property is equal to the
base rent or in the case of properties under construction the estimated base
rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated
total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of
contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentage listed above

the new properties are expected to contain approximately 719800 leasable square
feet and are 100 leased under net leases with an average initial lease term of
198 years at december 31 2002 six of the new properties were leased and
under construction pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to
develop the properties with development costs funded by realty income with
rent scheduled to begin during 2003

1318 million in the 2001 properties and properties under development in 2001
we also paid 401000 for releasing costs and 547000 for building
improvements on existing properties in our portfolio the initial weighted
average annual unleveraged return on the 1318 million invested in 2001 is
estimated to be 110 computed in the same manner as 2002s estimated initial
weighted average annual unleveraged return and subject to the same possible
outcome described above these 91 properties contain approximately 877200
leasable square feet and are 100 leased under net leases with an average
initial lease term of 201 years

provided an attractive return on our investment capital we purchased an
aggregate of 67 million of our securities since january 2000 we did not

we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the national association of
real estate investment trusts definition as net income available to common
stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant
to the real estate industry reduced by gains and increased by losses on i
sales of investment property and provisions for impairment and ii
extraordinary items


                     adjusted funds from operations affo

we utilize affo as a nongaap measure of our cash available for distributions to
our common stockholders most companies in our industry use a similar
measurement but they may use the term cad for cash available for
distribution or fad for funds available for distribution we define affo as
funds from operations i plus certain noncash items including amortization
of treasury lock settlements note financing costs and stock compensation ii
minus capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio such as
capitalized releasing costs and commissions and capitalized building
improvements and iii plus or minus straightline rent which is noncash

we consider ffo and affo to be appropriate nongaap measures of the performance
of equity reits financial analysts use ffo and affo in evaluating reits ffo
and affo can be a way to measure a reits ability to make cash distribution
payments presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in
comparing the performance of different reits although it should be noted that
not all reits calculate ffo and affo the same way therefore comparisons with
other reits may not be meaningful

ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash
needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an
indication of realty incomes performance in addition ffo and affo should not
be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating
investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity of our ability to
make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments

                              results of operations

management is required to make a number of assumptions and estimates that
directly impact the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
those assumptions and estimates are the basis for certain of our accounting
policies described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the
accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the companys
financial condition and results of operations and require managements most
difficult subjective or complex judgments are considered to be critical
accounting policies because of the uncertainties inherent in making assumptions
and estimates regarding unknown future outcomes events may result in
significant differences between our estimates and actual results management
believes that each of our assumptions and estimates are appropriate under the
circumstances and represent the most likely outcome we believe our most
critical accounting policies relate to depreciable lives of our real estate
assets and recoverability impairment of our real estate assets

the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended
december 31 2002 to the year ended december 31 2001

rental revenue was 1371 million for 2002 versus 1197 million for 2001 an
increase of 174 million or 145 the increase in rental revenue is
attributable to

o    the 108 properties acquired in 2002 which generated revenue of
     64 million
o    the 91 properties acquired in 2001 which generated revenue of
     139 million in 2002 compared to 29 million in 2001 an increase of
     110 million
o    properties owned by crest net which generated revenue of 14 million in
     2002 compared to 18 million in 2001 a decrease of 04 million
o    properties sold during 2002 and 2001 which generated rental revenue of
     44000 in 2002 as compared to 187 million in 2001 a decrease of
     183 million excluding rental revenue included in discontinued
     operations
o    development properties acquired before 2001 that started paying rent in
     2001 properties that were vacant during part of 2002 or 2001
     straightline rent and lease termination settlements that generated revenue
     of 53 million in 2002 as compared to 46 million in 2001 an increase of
     07 million and
o    same store rents generated on 950 leased properties owned in all of both
     2002 and 2001 increased by 145 million or 13 to 10997 million from
     10852 million

of the 1197 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2002 1192 or 996
are singletenant properties with the remaining properties being multitenant
properties of the 1192 singletenant properties 1165 or 977 were net
leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension
options of approximately 109 years at december 31 2002 of our 1165 leased
singletenant properties 1102 or 946 were under leases that provide for
increases in rents through

o    base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment
     ceilings
o    overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants gross sales
o    fixed increases or
o    a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 16 million in 2002
and 17 million in 2001

our portfolio of retail real estate owned under net leases continues to
perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of
monthly dividends at december 31 2002 our property portfolio consisting of
1197 retail properties was 977 leased with only 27 properties available for
lease

transactions to lease or sell 13 of the 27 properties available for lease or
sale at december 31 2002 were underway or completed as of march 1 2003 we
anticipate these transactions to be completed during the next six months
although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be sold or leased
within this period it has been our experience that approximately 1 to 3 of
our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time however
we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not
exceed these levels

gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale in 2002 crest net sold 23
properties for 273 million and realty income recognized a gain on the sales of
35 million before income taxes in 2001 crest net sold nine properties for
289 million and realty income recognized a gain on the sales of 34 million
before income taxes

at december 31 2002 crest net had 46 million invested in four properties
which are held for sale it is crest nets intent to carry an average inventory
of between 20 million to 25 million in real estate we anticipate crest nets
level of inventory increasing during 2003 crest net generates an earnings
spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives and the cost of
capital used to acquire its properties this earnings spread on crest nets
inventory covers the ongoing operating expenses of crest net

interest coverage ratio our interest rate coverage for 2002 was 55 times and
for 2001 was 44 times interest coverage ratio is calculated as ebitda divided
by interest expense ebitda is calculated as follows net income plus interest
expense income taxes depreciation amortization and impairment losses less
gain on sales of investment properties our ebitda for the years ended december
31 2002 and 2001 was 1302 million and 1159 million respectively this

depreciation and amortization was 308 million in 2002 versus 284 million in
2001 the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition
of properties in 2001 and 2002 which was offset by property sales in 2001 and
2002 depreciation of buildings and improvements is computed using the
straightline method over an estimated useful life of 25 years if we used a
shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our
results of operations and financial position we believe that 25 years is an
appropriate estimate of useful life no depreciation has been recorded on crest
nets properties because they are held for sale

the carrying value to its fair value during the second quarter of 2002 we
completed the transitional impairment testing of our goodwill and found that our
goodwill was not impaired

in portfolio property insurance and costs associated with properties available
for lease

a provision for impairment loss of 13 million was recorded in 2002 and is
included in discontinued operations a provision for impairment loss of
15 million was recorded in 2001 we review longlived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the asset may not be recoverable generally a provision is made for impairment
loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest
charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the
current book value impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the
current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset the
carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated
balance sheet if events should occur that required us to reduce the carrying
value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses it could
have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

income from discontinued operations in august 2001 the financial accounting
standards board fasb issued statement no 144 accounting for the impairment
or disposal of longlived assets effective january 1 2002 statement no 144
superseded statement no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets
and for longlived assets to be disposed of statement no 144 requires
longlived assets to be disposed of to be measured at the lower of carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell on our balance sheet it also broadened
the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include a component of
an entity rather than a segment of a business statement no 144 states that a
component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that clearly can be
distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest
of the entity in accordance with statement no 144 we report each individual
property as a reporting component for determining discontinued operations four
properties listed as held for sale at december 31 2002 plus 32 properties sold
during 2002 were reported as discontinued operations as required by statement
no 144 three other properties reported as held for sale at december 31 2001

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate
higher returns enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or
extend our average remaining lease term at december 31 2002 we classified
real estate with a carrying amount of 65 million as held for sale which
includes 46 million in properties owned by crest net additionally we
anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet
been specifically identified we anticipate we will receive between 15 million
and 30 million in proceeds from the sale of investment properties during the
next 12 months we intend to invest these proceeds into new property
acquisitions

preferred stock dividends we paid preferred stock dividends of 97 million in
both 2002 and 2001

net income available to common stockholders in 2002 increased by 112 million
or 194 to 690 million versus 578 million in 2001

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders
includes gains and losses from the sale of investment properties the amount of
gains and losses varies from year to year based on the timing of property sales
and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders

the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2002 was
63 million this was 42 million less than the gain recognized from
investment property sales during 2001 excluding the gain on sales of investment
properties net income available to common stockholders increased by
154 million or 326

2001 versus 68 million in 2000 general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenue increased to 63 in 2001 as compared to 59 in 2000
included in general and administrative expenses are 496000 and 333000 of
expenses attributable to crest net in 2001 and 2000 respectively general and
administrative expenses excluding expenses attributable to crest net increased
primarily due to increases in the cost of living which includes increases in
payroll costs

property expenses were 24 million in 2001 and 20 million in 2000 the
400000 increase in property expenses is primarily attributable to an increase
in portfolio property insurance and costs associated with properties available
for lease

other expenses were 18 million in 2001 and 807000 in 2000 the increase in
2001 is primarily attributable to an increase in crest net income taxes the

                               impact of inflation

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of
increases in the tenants sales volumes increases in the consumer price index
andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease
provisions to result in rent increases over time during times when inflation is
greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases
may not keep up with the rate of inflation

approximately 973 or 1165 of the 1197 properties in the portfolio are
leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property
costs and expenses these lease features reduce our exposure to rising property
expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse
impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed their
increases in revenue


                       impact of accounting pronouncements

our financial position or results of operations




item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
          

we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit
facility and longterm notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real
estate investment portfolio and operations our interest rate risk management
objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash
flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we
issue longterm notes primarily at fixed rates and may selectively enter into
derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements interest
rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related
financial instrument we were not a party to any derivative financial
instruments at december 31 2002 we do not enter into any transactions for
speculative or trading purposes

it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that
date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest
rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period

item 14 controls and procedures

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedure we maintain disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in securities exchange act 1934 rules 13a14c and
15d14c that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions
rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures
management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well
designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures

within 90 days prior to the date of this annual report we carried out an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective

changes in internal controls there have not been any significant changes in our
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation there were no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses and therefore no corrective actions were
taken

                revision of consolidated statements of income and
                     consolidated statements of cash flows

our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows
have been revised from those originally reported for the years ended december
31 2001 2000 and 1999 to separately reflect the results of discontinued
operations for 22 properties that were sold during the nine months ended
september 30 2002 and nine properties held for sale at september 30 2002
these results were previously included in income from operations these
revisions had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets or statements of
stockholders equity these revisions had no impact on net income or net income
per share of common stock for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999

these revisions are being made in conjunction with the expected filing by the
company of a shelf registration statement as a result of which the company is
required to revise its historical consolidated financial statements in
accordance with financial accounting statement no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets statement no 144 statement no
144 became effective january 1 2002 and broadened the reporting requirements of
discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a
segment of a business statement no 144 states that a component of an entity
comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished
operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity
in accordance with statement no 144 we report each individual property as a
reporting component for determining discontinued operations see the discussions
of discontinued operations in the results of operations section below


                                   the company

realty income corporation the monthly dividend company r a maryland
corporation realty income the company our or we was organized to
operate as an equity real estate investment trust reit over the past 33
years realty income has been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties
that generate rental revenue under longterm primarily 15 to 20 years lease
agreements our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from 1124
retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains

acquisition leasing legal retail and real estate research portfolio
management and capital markets expertise

                                       4

our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly distributions
from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations ffo per
share additionally we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo
per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of
additional properties

at december 31 2001 we owned a diversified portfolio

o  of 1124 properties

                         liquidity and capital resources


cash reserves realty income is organized to operate as an equity reit that
acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders in the form of
monthly cash distributions a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated
from leases on its retail properties we intend to retain an appropriate amount
of cash as working capital at december 31 2001 we had cash and cash
equivalents totaling 25 million

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash provided from
operating activities and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity
needs for the foreseeable future we intend however to use additional sources
of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facilities


capital funding we have a 200 million revolving unsecured acquisition credit
facility that expires in december 2003 we also have a 25 million revolving
unsecured credit facility that expires in february 2003 the credit facilities
currently bear interest at 1225 over the london interbank offered rate or
libor and offer us other interest rate options at march 1 2002 we had
borrowing capacity of 1515 million available on our credit facilities and an
outstanding balance of 735 million with an effective interest rate of 31

these credit facilities have been and are expected to be used to acquire
additional retail properties leased to national and regional retail chains under
longterm lease agreements any additional borrowings will increase our exposure
to interest rate risk we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties

in june 1999 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the
securities and exchange commission covering up to 4092 million in value of
common stock preferred stock and debt securities through march 1 2002 we
have issued 2093 million of common stock preferred stock and debt securities
under the universal shelf registration statement at march 1 2002 a balance of
1999 million was available under our universal shelf registration statement

in may 2001 we issued 2850000 shares of common stock at a price of 2780 per
share we issued an additional 100000 shares in may 2001 when the underwriters
exercised their overallotment option the net proceeds of 775 million were
used to repay borrowings under our 200 million acquisition credit facility and
for other general corporate purposes

in october 2001 we issued 2600000 shares of common stock at a price of 2850
per share we issued an additional 350000 shares in november 2001 when the
underwriters exercised their overallotment option the net proceeds of 795
million were used to repay borrowings under our 200 million acquisition credit
facility and for other general corporate purposes

trust at a net price to us of 3026 per share based on a 5 discount to the
market price at the time of issuance of 3185 per share the net proceeds of
82 million were used to repay bank borrowings

we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital
structure at march 1 2002 our total outstanding credit facility borrowings
and outstanding notes were 3035 million or approximately 209 of our total
market capitalization of 145 billion we define our total market
capitalization as the sum of the

o  shares of our common stock  outstanding  multiplied by the last reported
   sales price of the common stock on the nyse on march 1 2002 of 3140 per
   share
o  liquidation value of the class b preferred stock
o  liquidation value of the class c preferred stock and
o  outstanding borrowings on the credit facilities and outstanding notes at
   march 1 2002

historically we have met our longterm capital needs through the issuance of
common stock preferred stock and investment grade longterm unsecured notes
we believe that the majority of our future issuances of securities should be in
the form of common stock however we may issue additional preferred stock or
debt securities from time to time we may issue common stock when we believe
that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering
to be invested on an accretive basis into additional properties in addition we
may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by
our credit facilities or debt securities however we cannot assure you that we
will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us we
seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid
interest and fixed charge coverage ratios

we currently are assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our
senior unsecured notes from fitch ratings moodys investor service inc and
standard  poors rating group currently fitch ratings has assigned a rating
of bbb moodys has assigned a rating of baa3 and standard  poors has assigned
a rating of bbb to our senior notes these ratings could change based upon
among other things our results of operations and financial condition

we also have received credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our
preferred stock fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb moodys investor
service inc has assigned a rating of ba1 and standard  poors rating group
has assigned a rating of bb these ratings could change based upon among other
things our results of operations and financial condition

realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated investments in
special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing nor do we engage in
trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative
instruments

property acquisitions in 2001 we acquired 91 properties the new properties
located in 25 states in 2001 we invested 1318 million in the new properties
and properties under development which includes investments of 71 million for
properties acquired before 2001 estimated unfunded development costs on
properties under construction at december 31 2001 totaled 31 million in
2001 we capitalized 401000 for releasing costs and 547000 for building
improvements on existing properties in our portfolio

the initial weighted average annual unleveraged return on the 1318 million
invested in 2001 is estimated to be 110 computed as estimated contractual net
operating income which in the case of a netleased property is equal to the
base rent or in the case of properties under construction the estimated base
rent under the lease for the first year of each lease divided by the estimated
total costs since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of
contractual rent we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentage listed above

the new properties will contain approximately 877200 leasable square feet and
are 100 leased under net leases with an average initial lease term of 201
years at december 31 2001 two of the new properties were leased and under
construction pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to develop
the properties with development costs funded by realty income with rent
scheduled to begin in the first half of 2002

in 2000 we acquired 13 properties the 2000 properties and invested
700 million in the 2000 properties and properties under development in 2000
we also paid 308000 for releasing costs and 90000 for building improvements
on existing properties in our portfolio the initial weighted average annual
unleveraged return on the 700 million invested in 2000 is estimated to be
108 computed in the same manner as 2001s estimated initial weighted average
annual unleveraged return and subject to the same uncertainty described above
these 13 properties contain approximately 676100 leasable square feet and are
100 leased under net leases with an average initial lease term of 183 years

crest net lease we created crest net in january 2000 to buy own and sell
properties primarily to buyers using taxdeferred exchanges under section 1031
of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code in order to
comply with the reit qualification requirements in force when we created crest
net 5 of the common stock of crest net which represented 100 of the voting
stock was not owned by the company effective for 2001 the code was modified
to allow a reit to own up to 100 of the voting stock andor value of a
corporation that elects with the reit and qualifies to be treated as a taxable
reit subsidiary following the change in the code realty income and crest net
jointly elected to treat crest net as a taxable reit subsidiary effective
january 1 2001 and in may 2001 we acquired the 5 of crest nets common stock
owned by certain members of our management and the management of crest net for
507000 the acquisition of the 5 of common stock was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting the disinterested members of our board of
directors unanimously approved this transaction crest net originally issued
this stock for 450000 realty income also received rights to the undistributed
earnings on the stock which totaled 81200 after this transaction realty
income owns 100 of crest nets stock

we define ffo consistent with the national association of real estate
investment trusts definition as net income available to common stockholders
plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real
estate industry reduced by gains and increased by losses on i sales of
investment property and provisions for impairment and ii extraordinary items


                     adjusted funds from operations affo

we utilize affo as a measure of our cash available for distributions to our
common stockholders most companies in our industry use a similar measurement
but they may use the term cad for cash available for distribution or fad
for funds available for distribution we define affo as funds from operations
i plus certain noncash items  including amortization of note financing costs
 stock compensation  ii minus capitalized expenditures on existing
properties in our portfolio  such as capitalized leasing costs and commissions
and capitalized building improvements and iii plus or minus straightline
rent which is noncash rental revenue

affo for 2001 increased by 107 million or 157 to 789 million versus
682 million in 2000 affo for 1999 was 665 million

we consider ffo and affo to be appropriate measures of the performance of equity
reits financial analysts use ffo and affo in evaluating reits ffo and affo can
be a way to measure a reits ability to make cash distribution payments
presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing
the performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all
reits calculate ffo and affo the same way therefore comparisons with other
reits may not be meaningful

ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash
needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an
indication of realty incomes performance in addition ffo and affo should not
be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating
investing and financing activities as a measure of our liquidity our ability to
make cash distributions or our ability to pay interest payments

                              results of operations

management is required to make a number of assumptions and estimates that
directly impact the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
those assumptions and estimates are the basis for certain of our accounting
policies described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the
accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the companys
financial condition and results of operations and require managements most
difficult subjective or complex judgments are considered to be critical
accounting policies because of the uncertainties inherent in making assumptions
and estimates regarding unknown future outcomes events may result in
significant differences between our estimates and actual results management
believes that each of our assumptions and estimates are appropriate under the
circumstances and represent the most likely outcome we believe our critical
accounting policies relate to depreciable lives of our real estate assets and
recoverability impairment of our real estate assets


the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended
december 31 2001 to the year ended december 31 2000

rental revenue was 1199 million for 2001 versus 1149 million for 2000 an
increase of 50 million or 44 the increase in rental revenue is
attributable to

o the 91 properties acquired in 2001 which generated revenue of 29 million
o the 13 properties acquired in 2000 which generated revenue of 60 million in
  2001 compared to 17 million in 2000 an increase of 43 million
o properties owned by crest net which generated revenue of 18 million in 2001
  compared to 12 million in 2000 an increase of 588000
o properties sold during 2000 and 2001 which generated  revenue of 14 million
  in 2001 as compared to 70 million in 2000 a decrease of 56 million
o net rental increase of 900000 on development properties acquired before 2000
  that started paying rent in 2000 and properties  that were vacant during part
  of 2000 or 2001 and
o same store rents generated on 953 leased  properties owned in all of both 2001
  and 2000  increased  by 17  million  or 17  to 1033  million from
  1016 million

of the 1124 properties in the portfolio at december 31 2001 1119 or 996
are singletenant properties with the remaining properties being multitenant
properties of the 1119 singletenant properties 1099 or 982 were net
leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension
options of approximately 104 years of our 1099 leased singletenant
properties 1087 or 989 were under leases that provide for increases in
rents through


                                       11
page


o base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings
o percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants gross sales
o fixed increases or
o a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions

percentage rent which is included in rental revenue was 17 million in 2001
and 20 million in 2000

our portfolio of quality retail real estate owned under net leases continues to
perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of
monthly dividends at december 31 2001 our property portfolio of 1124 retail
properties was 982 leased with only 20 properties available for lease or sale

of the 20 properties not leased at december 31 2001 transactions to lease or
sell eight properties were underway or completed as of march 1 2002 we
anticipate these transactions to be completed during the first half of 2002
although we cannot assure you that all of these properties will be sold or
leased within this period


gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale in 2001 crest net sold nine
properties for 289 million and we recognized a gain of 34 million before
income taxes in 2000 crest net sold two properties for 62 million and we
recognized a gain of 766000 before income taxes

at december 31 2001 crest net had 223 million invested in 24 properties
which are held for sale it is crest nets intent to carry an average inventory
of between 20 to 25 million in real estate on an ongoing basis crest net
generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it
receives and the cost of capital used to acquire the properties it is our
belief that at this level of inventory these earnings will cover the ongoing
operating expenses of crest net

interest on outstanding loans and notes was 58 million lower in 2001 than in
2000 primarily due to a decrease of 589 million in the average outstanding
balances and a decrease of 35 basis points in our average interest rate in
2001 the federal reserve decreased the federal funds rate 11 times by an
aggregate total of 475 basis points correspondingly the average borrowing rate
on our credit facilities has declined during the same period the average
interest rate on our credit facilities decreased to 636 in 2001 from 767 in
2000 the majority of our credit facilities interest rate reductions in 2001
occurred during the second half of the year

at december 31 2001 the weighted average interest rate on our

o credit facility borrowings of 853 million was 313
o notes payable of 230 million was 799 and
o combined outstanding credit facilities and notes of 3153 million was 668

our debt service coverage ratio for 2001 was 44 times and for 2000 was 35
times debt service coverage ratio is calculated as follows earnings income
from operations before interest taxes depreciation amortization and
impairment losses ebitda divided by interest expense our ebitda for the
year ended december 31 2001 and 2000 was 1159 million and 1094 million
respectively this information should not be considered as an alternative to any
measure of performance as promulgated under gaap our calculation of ebitda may
be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore
comparability may be limited

our fixed coverage ratio for 2001 was 32 times and for 2000 was 27 times
fixed coverage ratio is calculated as follows ebitda divided by the sum of
interest expense and preferred stock dividends this information should not be
considered as an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under
gaap


depreciation and amortization was 285 million in 2001 versus 284 million in
2000 the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition
of properties in 2001 which was offset by property sales in 2001 the majority
of our 2001 acquisitions occurred during the fourth quarter depreciation of
buildings and improvements is computed using the straightline method over an
estimated useful life of 25 years if we used a shorter or longer estimated
useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations and
financial position we believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of
useful life

amortization of goodwill for each of the years 2001 2000 and 1999 was 924000
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142
goodwill and other intangible assets effective january 2002 our goodwill
will no longer be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least
annually if goodwill is determined to be impaired a provision for impairment
will be recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value


general and administrative expenses increased by 996000 to 78 million in
2001 versus 68 million in 2000 general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenue increased to 63 in 2001 as compared to 59 in 2000
included in general and administrative expenses are 496000 and 333000 of
expenses attributable to crest net in 2001 and 2000 respectively general and
administrative expenses excluding expenses attributable to crest net increased
primarily due to increases in the cost of living which includes increases in
payroll costs

we had 53 employees at march 1 2002 compared to 49 employees at march 1 2001


property expenses are broken down into costs associated with nonnet leased
multitenant properties unleased singletenant properties and general portfolio
expenses expenses related to the multitenant and unleased singletenant
properties include but are not limited to property taxes maintenance
insurance utilities property inspections bad debt expense and legal fees
general portfolio costs include but are not limited to insurance legal
property inspections and title search fees at december 31 2001 20 properties
were available for lease or sale as compared to 25 at december 31 2000

property expenses were 24 million in 2001 and 20 million in 2000 the
409000 increase in property expenses is primarily attributable to an increase
in portfolio property insurance and costs associated with properties available
for lease

70000 is included in income from discontinued operations no provision for
impairment loss was recorded in 2000 or 1999 we review longlived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable generally a provision is
made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted
and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted
are less than the current book value impairment losses are measured as the
amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of
the asset the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our
consolidated balance sheet if events should occur that required us to reduce
the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment
losses it could have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial position

                               impact of inflation

tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of
increases in the tenants sales volumes increases in the consumer price index
andor fixed increases we expect that inflation will cause these lease
provisions to result in increases in rent over time during times when inflation
is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases rent increases
may not keep up with the rate of inflation

approximately 978 or 1099 of the 1124 properties in the portfolio are leased
to tenants under net leases whereby the tenant is responsible for property costs
and expenses these lease features reduce our exposure to rising property
expenses due to inflation inflation and increased costs may have an adverse
impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases
in revenue
