covid19 pandemic update 

while great progress has been made in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic covid19 or pandemic there remain global challenges from the pandemics lasting effects in fiscal 2022 and 2021 due to an unprecedented demand for electronic devices and related industrywide supply constraints the global economy encountered a challenging supply chain environment at the end of fiscal 2022 the supply chain challenges we experienced as a result of the pandemic eased but we are currently unable to predict the extent to which they may adversely impact our future business operations financial performance and results of operations for a further discussion of the risks uncertainties and actions taken in response to covid19 see risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in part i item 1a 

in 2021 hpe adopted vaccination policies to protect the health and safety of our team members and customers we monitored the situation including pandemicrelated case data and broader government health guidelines in order to update these policies as the situation evolved during most of fiscal 2022 our team members in the us were required to be vaccinated in order to enter our sites work at customer and thirdparty sites and for travel to attend workrelated events unless the team member had an approved exemption granted by our human resources organization and underwent routine testing given the effectiveness and broad access of v accines along with their acceptance by a high percentage of our us workforce as of september 6 2022 we lifted our vaccination requirement for access to sites travel and workrelated events in the us however any team member or contingent worker working at or visiting customer or thirdparty sites must continue to comply with those parties rules and provide proof of vaccination or a negative test 

outside of the us sites are open at varying capacities based on local pandemic conditions and risk mitigation strategies enacted by country leadership we maintain compliance with all local laws and regulations with respect to office attendance and safety protocols 

our strategy 

over the last several years new megatrends around edge cloud and data have emerged to shape customer expectations for enterprise technology first data at the edge is increasing exponentially driven by the proliferation of devices that require secure connectivity to enable reliable digital experiences second enterprises need a cloud experience everywhere to manage data and workloads wherever they live across a distributed enterprise third data growth is creating countless new opportunities to generate meaningful business insights customer response to these megatrends has been accelerated by the pandemic and the increasing pace of technological innovation 

in concert with these trends enterprises are consuming their technology differently increasingly customers want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the information technology it they use 

the megatrends are ushering in longlasting changes to it including accelerating hybrid multicloud adoption customers across industry verticals are interested in unifying all the applications and data with a consistent cloud experience 

customers also want to better extract value from their growing stores of rapidly evolving data knowing that actionable insights from data are critical to deliver business outcomes data is becoming more unstructured more timesensitive and more distributed frequently data is siloed and spread across different multigen it systems often trapped in critical legacy architecture many organizations cannot adequately gain insights from their data at the edge or face cloud migration challenges because of their legacy applications customers need a datafirst modernization approach across edge to data center to cloud 

hpe has deployed an edgetocloud strategy that capitalizes on emergent megatrends and delivers a datafirst modernization approach for customers our vision to be the edgetocloud company has led us to innovate our solutions across connectivity cloud and data we have shifted our mix of products and services and how we deliver that mix to customers

our strengths 

we believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors including 

• edgetocloud strategy and solutions uniquely solve customer challenges as data grows and evolves and enterprises become increasingly distributed hpe’s edgetocloud strategy is uniquely designed to enable customers to securely access control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data assets to accelerate business outcomes the hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform is an open secure fully integrated platform that brings a unified experience across the edge data center colocation and cloud it is automated and easy to consume with capacity available to scale up and down on demand it offers true pay per use consumption so customers only pay for what they use and they can have the entire hybrid cloud experience managed for them through our hpe greenlake managed services offering 

• comprehensive portfolio we have a distinctive and industry leading portfolio of edgetocloud solutions and unique capabilities to help accelerate our customers digital transformations we combine our softwaredefined infrastructure and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise solutions in the it industry our ability to deliver a comprehensive it strategy and connect our customers data from edge to cloud through our highquality products and highvalue consulting and support services in a single package is one of our principal differentiators 

• differentiated consumptionbased it solutions for a growing opportunity enterprises of all sizes are looking to digitally transform in order to develop nextgeneration cloudnative applications create actionable insights from their data and drive business growth but they face many challenges including lack of inhouse it skills limited budgets and options for financing and lack of flexibility to choose the technology foundation that best meets their needs consumptionbased it offers solutions to these challenges by providing greater agility which empowers people to shift from managing infrastructure to driving innovation by leveraging insights from their data while also eliminating capital and operating expenses tied to infrastructure overprovisioning hpe is distinctly differentiated in delivering a true consumptionbased it experience 

• open platforms the world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a future of centers of data everywhere which are highly decentralized and distributed this shift demands a unified cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to customers’ data sources to create realtime insights everywhere we believe the cloud experience should be open and seamless across all our customers clouds rather than requiring customers to be locked into a cloud stack 

• multiyear innovation roadmap and strong balance sheet we have been in the technology and innovation business for over 80 years our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the expanding amount of data available and leverage the latest technology developments such as cloud artificial intelligence supercomputing and cybersecurity to drive business outcomes now and in the future we also have a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile that provide the financial flexibility and speed to take advantage of acquisition opportunities

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups including business and public sector enterprises and purchases of our products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

• resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups 

• distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers 

• original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products and services with their own products and services and sell the integrated solution 

• independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products 

• systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and 

• advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services 

the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses this has resulted in a combined gotomarket model in which we have a direct sales presence in a number of countries while we sell and deliver our products solutions and services through a channelonly model in the remaining countries in those countries where we have a direct sales presence we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers as well as with large public sector accounts the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smaller accounts both in the commercial and public sector space 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design the use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand in addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

historically we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing 

table of conten t 

high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on singlesource suppliers for certain customized parts although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption and a disruption or loss of a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products in some instances our singlesource suppliers eg intel and amd as suppliers of certain x86 processors are also the singlesource suppliers for the entire market disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are geographically concentrated when necessary we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly in item 1a 

as a result of the pandemic worldwide demand for electronic components spiked in many different technology sectors causing industrywide shortages for many electronic components while availability for many components are now recovering some shortages are nevertheless anticipated to persist hpe continues to rely on proactive inventory buffering measures in order to position ourselves well for availability of those components we will take additional inventory actions as appropriate in alignment to the market demand and will continue to leverage strong partnerships and longterm agreements with our suppliers 

backlog 

backlog represents the price of orders related to current or prior periods for which work has not been performed or goods have not been delivered as of the reporting period 

the global pandemic resulted in an unprecedented demand for electronic devices which coupled with related industrywide supply constraints and inflationary pressures has led to a challenging supply chain environment additionally the lasting effects of the pandemic have continued to play a role with ongoing delays to the global logistics environment during fiscal 2022 while the demand for our products remained strong we continued to experience a shortage of certain key components logistics timing issues and a challenging global economic environment at the same time in the second half of fiscal 2022 certain supply chain challenges eased in part as a result of a softening demand environment for consumer electronic devices resulting in increased supply to enterprise markets we exited fiscal 2022 with an elevated backlog as compared to the prior fiscal yearend we expect the supply chain environment to continue to present challenges in the near term 

during the pandemic we have viewed backlog as an indication of demand health as governments around the world imposed restrictions on nonessential work activities and travel as and when the pandemic subsides particularly in nonus geographies in which we operate our focus on backlog may again become less relevant as a reliable indicator of future demand 

for a further discussion of the risks uncertainties and actions taken in response to the pandemic see risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products 

a summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in note 2 segment information to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii approximately 67 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2022 came from sales outside the united states

patents 

our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position as of october 31 2022 our worldwide patent portfolio included approximately 13000 issued and pending patents 

patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties

seasonality 

from time to time the markets in which we sell our products services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months however the pandemic resulted in a temporary disruption to the seasonal fluctuation of our business see risk factors—our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a 

competition 

we have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise it infrastructure products solutions and services which includes our asaservice offerings we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business we compete primarily on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our it infrastructure offerings 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are relatively short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services continuously enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above among others in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

the competitive environments in which our segments operate are described below

supply chain responsibility and human rights 

we manage our supply chain to help reduce risk improve product quality achieve environmental and social goals and improve overall performance and value creation for our customers partners and suppliers building upon the successful launch of our supply chain data management software we have begun sharing supplierfacing ghg emissions management tools that provide companyspecific emissions data the ability to track progress toward their publicly stated emissions reduction goals and the ability to view their own performance against that of their peers we also work directly with our suppliers to help them implement renewable energy projects at their manufacturing locations 

our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion extends beyond our workforce and to our suppliers as well we believe a diverse supply chain and equity in sourcing not only creates opportunities for underrepresented and underserved communities but also contributes to the resiliency of our supply chain and of our communities 

human rights principles are embedded in how we do business and we are committed to holding our entire value chain to high ethical standards that respect such principles 

we have processes in place to enable the early detection of forced labor and have implemented due diligence procedures to monitor and help prevent human rights violations or abuses at our suppliers and in our operations 

additionally through our responsible minerals program we work to advance the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products and within our supply chain 

while the hpe board of directors and all of its committees take an integrated rather than siloed approach to providing oversight of esg matters including environmental sustainability supply chain responsibility and human rights our nominating governance and social responsibility committee is primarily responsible for oversight of our broader esg strategy initiatives risks policies and disclosures 

material government regulations 

our business activities are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are presently not material to our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations nonetheless as discussed below we believe that global trade and certain environmental regulations could potentially materially impact our business 

environment 

our products and operations are or may in the future be subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment including among others laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management movement and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites product safety such as chemical composition packaging and labeling energy consumption of our products and services and the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances we proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain taking into account among other things published lists of substances of concern new and upcoming legal requirements customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including servers and networking equipment financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation we are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues such as energy consumption carbon emissions reusing or recycling finally as climate change and other environmentalrelated laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines in the event our products are impacted by these laws or standards our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private companies and we could face other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and other environmentalrelated issues and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental and environmentalrelated laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we support this commitment with a comprehensive environmental health and safety policy a strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide 

table of conten t 

environmental programs and services an extensive supply chain responsibility program and an approach to ethical standards and strong governance that are the foundations of our business 

global trade 

as a global company the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties us export controls and sanctions laws customs regulations and local trade rules around the world such laws rules and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals or the need to comply with domestic preference programs laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code unique technical standards localization mandates and duplicative incountry testing and inspection requirements the consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally we continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated crossborder supply chains that will continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating hewlett packard enterprise and its common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k 

business and operational risks 

we are unable to predict the extent to which the ongoing global covid19 pandemic or other outbreaks epidemics pandemics or public health crises may adversely impact our business operations financial performance and results of operations 

for the past two years the covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations the pandemic has resulted in and may continue to or at a later time result in a global slowdown of economic activity including travel restrictions prohibitions of nonessential activities in some cases disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control including the various restrictions imposed by cities counties states and countries on our employees customers partners and suppliers designed to limit the spread of covid19 although the immediate impacts of the covid19 pandemic have been assessed and mitigated the ultimate extent of the impact of the pandemic including as a result of possible subsequent outbreaks of covid19 or of new variants thereof and measures taken in response thereto will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and cannot currently be predicted 

based on employee vaccination rates and public health guidance we have begun a return to most hpe offices on a hybrid basis for most employees adhering to any government requirements in effect locally we continue to monitor the situation including cases within our workforce and will take action to adjust office attendance policies as circumstances warrant in order to protect the health and safety of employees contractors and others who visit our sites vaccination requirements or other risk mitigation strategies for site entry and other activities remain in effect in many countries where it is legally permissible to implement such a requirements though discretion to implement such policies has been returned to local executive leadership 

the pandemic and its uneven recovery have adversely affected continue to adversely affect and we expect may continue to adversely affect our business in a variety of ways including by restricting our operations and sales marketing and distribution efforts and disrupting the supply chains of hardware products in addition as the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our customers partners and suppliers there have been and there may continue to be delays of hardware product shipments from our vendors and out of our manufacturing and logistics operations worldwide as a result of capacity issues while capacity shortages are beginning to show signs of recovery they may nevertheless persist adversely disrupting our business additionally concerns over the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our stock price our ability to access capital markets and our ability to fund liquidity needs 

outbreaks epidemics pandemics or public health crises may in the future adversely affect among other things demand for our products and services our operations and sales marketing and distribution efforts the supply chains of hardware products and components our research and development capabilities our engineering design and manufacturing processes and other important business activities outbreaks epidemics pandemics or public health crises may also result in our restriction or suspension of international andor domestic travel prohibitions of nonessential activities in some cases and limit our inperson activities within hpe and with customers such outbreaks epidemics pandemics or public health crises may also present operational challenges such as unanticipated disruptions in services provided through our localized physical infrastructure which can in turn curtail the functioning of critical components of our it systems and adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders provide services respond to customer requests and maintain our worldwide business operations 

the negative impacts of the global covid19 pandemic or other outbreaks epidemics pandemics or public health crises on the broader global economy and related impacts on our or our customers’ business operations and demand for our products and services will depend on future developments and actions taken in response to such events which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted additional impacts and risks that we are not currently aware of may arise we are similarly unable to predict the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic or other outbreaks epidemics pandemics or public health crises on our customers partners and suppliers to the extent the covid19 pandemic or other outbreaks epidemics pandemics or public health crises adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and stock price they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this part i item 1a of this form 10k 

table of conten t 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations and supply chain could be disrupted by natural or humaninduced disasters including but not limited to earthquakes tsunamis floods hurricanes cyclones or typhoons fires other extreme weather conditions power or water shortages telecommunications failures materials scarcity and price volatility terrorist acts civil unrest conflicts or wars and medical epidemics or pandemics the impacts and frequency of any of the above could furthermore be exacerbated by climate change particularly in countries where we operate that have limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources we are predominantly selfinsured to mitigate the impact of most catastrophic events although it is impossible to completely predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events forecasting disruptive events and building additional resiliency into our operations accordingly will become an increasing business imperative the occurrence of business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations 

climate change serves as a risk multiplier increasing both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations our corporate headquarters is located in spring texas which suffers from floods hurricanes and other extreme weather and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california which suffers from drought conditions and catastrophic wildfires each affecting the health and safety of our employees in california to mitigate wildfire risk electric utilities have been periodically deploying public safety power shutoffs which affects electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities in 2017 our principal worldwide it data centers in houston were flooded due to hurricane harvey since then hpe has increased its resiliency through site selection and infrastructure technological investments to mitigate and adapt to physical risks from climate change while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change through such efforts we may be unsuccessful in doing so as there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted furthermore climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters 

the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including the united states puerto rico czech republic mexico china malaysia taiwan and singapore we also rely on major logistics hubs which are strategically located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to hpes distribution channels and customers our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near vulnerable locations is continuing to be assessed 

our transition to a software consumptionbased business model may adversely affect our business operating results and free cash flow 

we are currently transitioning to an asaservice company providing our entire portfolio through a range of software consumptionbased payperuse and asaservice offerings we will also continue to provide our hardware and software in a capital expenditure and licensebased model ultimately giving our customers choices in consuming hpe products and services in a traditional or asaservice offering such business model changes entail significant risks and uncertainties and we may be unable to complete the transition to a software consumptionbased business model or manage the transition successfully and in a timely manner and our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results may be adversely affected additionally we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the software consumption transition even if we successfully complete the transition the transition to a software consumptionbased business model also means that our historical results especially those achieved before we began the transition may not be indicative of our future results further as customer demand for our software consumptionbased business model offerings increases we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings for which revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery and our asaservice offerings for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 

in addition the transition to an asaservice company is expected to require incremental capital requirements resulting in a negative impact to cash flows in the near term and may require us to dedicate additional resources including sales and marketing costs furthermore we anticipate needing to continually adapt our gotomarket structure to better align with the software consumptionbased business model we must adapt our sales processes for new sales and marketing approaches including those required by our shift to software consumptionbased services and other changes resulting from the pandemic changing our gotomarket structure may affect employee compensation models and ultimately our ability to retain employees 

table of conten t 

there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these adjustments in a timely or costeffective manner or that we will be able to realize all or any of the expected benefits from such adjustments further our software consumption offerings could subject us to increased risk of liability related to the provision of services as well as operational technical legal or other costs 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers abilities to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of solutions that we offer the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain solutions problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply and contractual relational and labor risks each of which is described below 

• component shortages we have been and are currently experiencing delays and shortages of certain components as a result of strong demand and capacity constraints due to economic changes resulting from the covid19 pandemic disruptions in the operations of component suppliers and other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers as shortages or delays persist the price of certain components has increased and we may be exposed to quality issues and delivery delays we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays 

• excess supply in order to secure components for our products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into long term agreements noncancelable commitments or other inventory management arrangements with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

• contractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

• contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws 

• singlesource suppliers we obtain certain components from singlesource suppliers due to technology availability price quality scale or customization needs replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may initially be unable to meet demand or be subject to other output limitations for some components such as customized components alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of a singlesource supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a singlesource supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a singlesource supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance

while our restructuring plans are substantially complete their implementation periods are ongoing and it is possible that we may not achieve all of the expected benefits of such restructuring plans 

we have announced and have been implementing restructuring plans including the hpe next initiative whereby we are simplifying our operating model and streamlining our offerings business processes and business systems and the cost optimization and prioritization plan in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs as well as simplify our organizational structure upgrade our it infrastructure and redesign business processes while our restructuring plans are substantially complete their implementation periods are ongoing and it is possible that we may not be able to maintain all the cost savings and benefits that were attained in connection with our restructurings additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to sustain all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans the hpe next initiative and the cost optimization and prioritization plan see note 3 transformation programs to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our strategy we may acquire businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions and also handle any postclosing issues such as integration for example in september 2020 we acquired silver peak systems inc an sdwan industry leader and in september 2019 we acquired cray inc a global supercomputer leader in april 2017 and september 2017 we spun off our enterprise services and software businesses respectively see also the risk factors below under the heading risks related to prior separations 

risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our financial results including our effective tax rate 

• we may not successfully combine product or service offerings or fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction which may result in 1 failure to retain employees customers distributors and suppliers 2 increase in unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations which may cause financial results to differ from expectations and 3 significant increase in costs and expenses including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans 

• our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives we may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired companys product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or all of the factors necessary to estimate reasonably accurate costs timing and other matters 

• in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders or we may enter into financing arrangements which could affect our liquidity and financial condition 

• for an acquisition or other combination the acquisition partner may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls which could impact our exposure to data security incidents and potentially increase anticipated costs or time to integrate the business 

• business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation which could impact our financial condition and results of operations 

• we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

• for a divestiture we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated 

• the impact of divestitures on our revenue growth may be larger than projected as we may experience greater dissynergies than expected if we do not satisfy preclosing conditions and necessary regulatory and governmental 

table of conten t 

approvals on acceptable terms it may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

• our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult or discourage an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise if our board of directors deems it to be undesirable provisions such as indemnification meeting requirements and blank check stock authorizations could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests or changes in control or management of hewlett packard enterprise 

managements attention or other resources may be diverted during business combination and investment transactions and further impacted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives 

system security risks data protection incidents cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or it services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

as a leading technology firm we are exposed to attacks from criminals nation state actors and activist hackers collectively malicious parties who have been able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures although some of these attacks have caused disruptions or exposure of information so far these attacks have not resulted in material losses to hpe nor have any of hpes consumers customers or employees informed hpe that these attacks resulted in material harm to them it is possible that future attacks may result in material misappropriation system disruptions or shutdowns malicious alteration or destruction of our confidential or personal information or that of third parties malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products including within our cloudbased environments and offerings malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain and the systems or networks of other third parties on whom we rely and as such may embed malicious software or hardware in our products for use in compromising our customers geopolitical tensions or conflicts such as the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine may create a heightened risk of such cyberattacks or exacerbate system vulnerabilities especially in light of our hybrid work environment in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our business may process store and transmit customer data including commercially sensitive and personal data subject to the european general data protection regulation the california consumer privacy act the california privacy rights act and other privacy laws with our business increasingly providing asaservice offerings malicious parties could target such services potentially resulting in an increased risk of compromise of customer data and regulatory exposure incidents involving our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information sensitive confidential or personal data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in regulatory fines litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of managing an incident and implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also have experienced and may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive furthermore our data centers depend on predictable and reliable energy and networking capabilities the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected or disrupted by a variety of factors including but not limited to the effects of climate change such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we deliver global edgetocloud platform asaservice to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from all of their data everywhere hpe delivers unique open and intelligent technology solutions including those utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities with a consistent experience across all clouds and edge computing platforms to successfully execute this strategy we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by improving cost structure aligning sales coverage with strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing and improving an edgetocloud platform asaservice solution and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered asaservice progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions should such efforts fail to produce actionable insights or our products not perform as promised our business results may be adversely affected any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

having developed an edgetocloud platform product in hpe greenlake we must be able to continue to scale quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all our hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform faces competition from peer companies with their own cloud platform offerings and to succeed we will need to compete effectively across numerous factors any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution including new features of the hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform could result in our offerings being late to reach the market which could further harm our competitive position 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer  

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence may result in reputational harm or liability 

we currently incorporate ai capabilities into certain of our offerings and our research into and continued development of such capabilities remain ongoing as with many innovations ai presents risks challenges and unintended consequences that could affect its adoption and therefore our business ai algorithms may be flawed datasets may be insufficient or contain 

table of conten t 

biased information ineffective or inadequate ai development or deployment practices by us or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of ai solutions or cause harm to individuals or society these deficiencies and other failures of ai systems could subject us to competitive harm regulatory action legal liability and brand or reputational harm some ai scenarios present ethical issues and while we aim to use ai ethically and attempt to predict and anticipate ethical issues presented by its use we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights privacy employment or other social economic or political issues we may experience brand or reputational harm 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including both direct and indirect distributors and resellers sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement moreover some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation certain equitybased incentive awards for certain executives contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened 

our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations as competition for highly skilled employees in our industry has grown increasingly intense we have experienced and may continue to experience higher than anticipated levels of employee attrition these risks to attracting and retaining the necessary talent may be exacerbated by recent labor constraints and inflationary pressures on employee wages and benefits

failure to meet esg expectations or standards or achieve our esg goals could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or stock price 

there has been an increased focus from regulators and stakeholders on esg matters including greenhouse gas emissions and climaterelated risks diversity equity and inclusion responsible sourcing and supply chain human rights and social responsibility and corporate governance and oversight given our commitment to esg we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals commitments and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future these goals commitments and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts and ability to manage these issues provide updates on them and accomplish our goals commitments and targets present numerous operational regulatory reputational financial legal and other risks any of which may be outside of our control or could have a material adverse impact on our business including on our reputation and stock price further there is uncertainty around the accounting standards and climaterelated disclosures associated with emerging laws and reporting requirements and the related costs to comply with the emerging regulations 

our failure or perceived failure to achieve our esg goals maintain esg practices or comply with emerging esg regulations that meet evolving regulatory or stakeholder expectations could harm our reputation adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and talent and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities our reputation also may be harmed by the perceptions that our stakeholders have about our action or inaction on esgrelated issues damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and could also reduce our stock price 

industry risks 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution product range and ease of use account relationships customer training service and support and security of our offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have vertical relationships in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have vertical relationships also may acquire or form relationships with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with vertical partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may continue to do so as a consequence of inflation and higher supply chain and manufacturing costs we have been increasing the prices of many of our products and services to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products and services we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product 

table of conten t 

decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards software defined and public cloud which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products 

international risks 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates and costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments for example in response to increasing inflation the us federal reserve along with central banks around the world have been raising interest rates and signaled expectations of additional rate increases it is difficult to predict the impact of such events on us our thirdparty partners or customers or economic markets more broadly which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments and businesses in response to macroeconomic events and the effectiveness of those actions such actions may impact our ability desire or the timing of seeking funding for various investment opportunities economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses further ongoing us federal government spending priorities may limit demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions 

our business and financial performance also could be adversely affected by changes in us trade policy us export controls and sanctions and us regulations concerning imports as well as international laws and regulations relating to global trade current us government trade policy includes the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign goods including information and communication technology products these measures have materially increased costs for certain goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices result in lowering our margin on products sold us government trade policy has resulted in and could result in more us trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries similarly changes in regulations relating to exports could prevent us from exporting products to certain locations or customers entirely in addition changes in requirements relating to making foreign direct investments could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions 

sales outside the united states constituted approximately 67 of our net revenue in fiscal 2022 our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine and the relationship between china and the us 

• inflationary pressures such as those the market is currently experiencing which may increase costs for materials supplies and services 

• adverse or uncertain macroeconomic conditions including fears of a global economic downturn or recession 

table of conten t 

• network security privacy and data sovereignty concerns which could make foreign customers reluctant to purchase products and services from usbased technology companies 

• longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers 

• local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and oems or changes to immigration and labor law policies which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent 

• managing our geographically dispersed workforce 

• differing technology standards or customer requirements 

• local content and manufacturing requirements which could impact our ability to sell into those markets 

• difficulties associated with repatriating earnings in restricted countries and changes in tax laws and 

• fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments 

the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine has impacted business and financial performance in that region hpe is proceeding with an exit of our remaining business in russia and belarus while closely monitoring and analyzing the trade restrictions imposed against russia and belarus by the united states the european union the “eu” and several other jurisdictions to ensure hpe’s compliance with applicable laws we cannot provide any assurance that such exit will be efficient or uninterrupted which may negatively impact our operational expenses due to increased relocation costs or impact service delivery in such geographies 

we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with anticorruption laws around the world including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act but in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies people may engage in business practices prohibited by anticorruption laws our employees and third parties we work with may take actions in violation of our policies and those actions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the japanese yen and british pound can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

intellectual property risks 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

table of conten t 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties for example many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement including patent infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights patent assertion entities frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of extracting infringement settlements if we cannot license or replace allegedly infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products discontinue certain product offerings enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

financial risks 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service standard  poors ratings services and fitch ratings services despite these investment grade credit ratings any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts additionally increased borrowing costs including those arising from a credit rating downgrade can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

in addition to our current total carrying debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future this collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors including 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments 

• making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations 

• increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry and 

table of conten t 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock 

recent quantitative tightening by the us federal reserve along with other central banks around the world may affect our shortterm ability or desire to incur debt to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks described above could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to service or refinance our debt 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue 

the conflict between russia and ukraine and the trade sanctions imposed by the us the eu and other countries in response have negatively impacted our operations and financial performance in both countries there could be additional negative impacts to our net revenues earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope including among other potential impacts economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of europe 

furthermore the relationship between china and the us and any subsequent action that may be taken by either country may negatively impact our operations and financial performance there could be additional uncertainty surrounding the enforceability of contract obligations as well as the timing and form of payments from china 

competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability variations in fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in addition newer geographic market opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our businesses our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

separately supply chain shortages and constraints have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers we have in some instances responded to such constraints by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity while these measures have been taken to shorten lead times to deliver products to customers they may

also result in excess or obsolete components in the future if the demand for our products is less than we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition as discussed in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies—use of estimates and note 17 litigation and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

regulatory risks 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations such as those concerning environmental protection for example we face increasing complexity related to product design the use of regulated hazardous and scarce materials the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to the use of products the transportation and shipping of products climate change regulations and the reuse recycling andor disposal of products and their components at endofuse or useful life as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our transition to a more circular economy a significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales any changes to current environmental legal requirements such as the eus restriction of hazardous substances directive the eus waste electrical and electronic equipment directive chinas regulation on management methods for controlling pollution caused by electronic information products the eus lot 9 regulation on product energy efficiency and indias regulation on ewaste collection and recycling among others may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the eu china india andor other countries proposing or adopting similar environmental legal requirements in addition other esgrelated laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are being proposed adopted and implemented throughout the world including but not limited to the european commission’s proposal on corporate sustainability due diligence if we were to violate or become liable under environmental or certain esgrelated laws or if our products become noncompliant with such laws or market access requirements it could result in loss of market access or limit offerings in those markets or our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could incur costs or face other sanctions such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions fines andor civil or criminal sanctions environmental regulations may also impact the availability and cost of energy or emissions related to energy consumption which may increase our cost of manufacturing andor the cost of powering and cooling owned it infrastructures 

in addition our business is subject to an evergrowing number of laws addressing privacy and information security in particular we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings the increase in asaservice offerings may also be impacted by data localization and international data transfer requirements under various privacy laws including those arising from the schrems ii ruling in europe if we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy or security we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions our potential exposure includes regulatory fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims and reputational damage 

failure to comply with government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various government procurement laws and regulations required contract provisions and other requirements relating to contract formation administration and performance as well as manufacturing content and security requirements any violation of government contracting laws and regulations or contract terms could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and fines treble damages and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition we will continue to be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new government contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the united states has proposed changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these proposals if finalized and adopted by the associated countries would impose a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

during fiscal 2019 we executed a termination and mutual release agreement which terminated our tax matters agreement with hp inc because we now have limited indemnity rights from hp inc we potentially bear more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments 

on august 16 2022 the us government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 the “inflation reduction act” into law which includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax the corporate amt beginning in fiscal 2024 of 15 on the adjusted financial statement income “afsi” of corporations with average afsi exceeding 10 billion over a threeyear period and an excise tax of 1 tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after december 31 2022 the impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods we are evaluating the corporate amt and its potential impact on our future us tax expense cash taxes and effective tax rate as well as any other impacts the inflation reduction act may have on our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to prior separations 

the stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment could result in significant tax liability and dxc technology company or micro focus international plc as applicable may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us 

the completed separations and mergers of our former enterprise services business with dxc technology company dxc the everett transaction or everett and our software segment with micro focus international plc micro focus the seattle transaction or seattle were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of i the relevant distribution and related transactions as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 368a 361 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the code and ii the relevant merger as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code while the seattle transaction generally qualified for taxfree treatment for us seattle spinco and micro focus the acquisition of seattle spinco by micro focus resulted in the recognition of gain but not loss for us persons who received micro focus american depositary shares in the software separation 

each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us everett spinco and csc or us seattle spinco and micro focus as applicable if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized notwithstanding the opinions of counsel the internal revenue service the irs could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position 

if the distribution of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who receive everett spinco shares or seattle spinco 

table of conten t 

shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

we obtained private letter rulings from the irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation of our enterprise services business and software segment those rulings concluded that certain transactions in those separations are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the conclusions of the irs private letter rulings were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete the validity of the irs private letter rulings may be affected notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment including nonus tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material if the completed separation of our former enterprise services business or software segment including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those separations are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor dxc andor micro focus could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

under the tax matters agreements entered into by us with everett spinco and csc and with seattle spinco and micro focus everett spinco and seattle spinco generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by or acquisitions of capital stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable any such indemnity obligations could be material 

we continue to face a number of risks related to our separation from hp inc our former parent including those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and shared use of certain intellectual property rights which could in the future adversely impact our reputation 

in connection with our separation from hp inc on november 1 2015 the separation hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc entered into several agreements that determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations in these agreements hp inc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify hp inc for certain liabilities including crossindemnities that are designed and intended to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of hp incs business with hp inc we may be obligated to fully indemnify hp inc for certain liabilities under the separation agreements or hp inc may not be able to fully cover their indemnification obligations to us under the same separation agreements each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the terms of the separation also include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively as a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hp inc could also adversely affect the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise 

general risks

investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows our stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile and can be affected by among other things speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by us or our competitors developments in our transformation programs or in our transition to an asaservice business model our quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us the financial results and business strategies of our competitors inflation market volatility or downturns caused by outbreaks epidemics pandemics geopolitical tensions or conflicts or other macroeconomic dynamics developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes or the timing and amount of our share repurchases general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hewlett packard enterprises performance also may affect the price of hewlett packard enterprises stock volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources

trends and uncertainties 

the overall demand environment continues to improve but remains impacted by industrywide supply constraints which contributed to a challenging supply chain environment and inflationary pressures both of which have been driving up material logistics and overall costs the pandemicrelated lockdowns in china we experienced in the first half of the fiscal period alleviated somewhat in the second half of the fiscal period the challenging supply chain environment moderated our fullyear revenue growth elevated costs and delayed certain unit shipments resulting in part in a higher level of backlog and related inventory at the end of the current period as compared to the end of the prioryear period 

to address the challenging supply chain environment we are taking proactive measures such as guiding certain customer demand to specific products enhancing component engineering design and multisourcing with indirect procurement we expect the supply chain environment to continue to present challenges in the near term 

additionally we are experiencing a challenging foreign exchange environment which has moderated our revenue and earnings growth we expect the unfavorable foreign exchange effects and inflationary trend to continue in the longer term we expect the substantial completion of our hpe next and cost optimization and prioritization restructuring plans coupled with related cost reduction measures and operational efficiencies to moderate the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange effects and inflationary pressures in fiscal 2023 

russiaukraine conflict 

t he conflict between russia and ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the us european union eu and other countries in response have negatively impacted our operations in both countries and increased economic and political uncertainty across the world in response to the sanctions imposed in february 2022 we suspended all new sales and shipments to russia and belarus and implemented compliance measures to address the continuously changing regulatory landscape based on a further assessment of business risks and needs in june 2022 we determined that it is no longer tenable to maintain operations in russia and belarus and have been proceeding with an orderly managed exit of our remaining business in these countries 

in fiscal 2021 our operations in russia and belarus accounted for approximately 2 of our total net revenue during fiscal 2022 we recorded total pretax charges of 161 million primarily related to expected credit losses of financing and trade receivables employee severance and abandoned assets 99 million of which was included in financing cost 12 million in cost of services and 50 million in disaster charges in the consolidated statements of earnings 

we will continue monitoring the social political regulatory and economic environment in russia and ukraine and will consider further actions as appropriate more broadly there could be additional adverse impacts to our net revenues earnings and cash flows should the situation continue or escalate geopolitical tensions and the impacts of recession inflation and supply chain pressures both regionally and globally 

recent us tax legislation 

on august 16 2022 the us government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 the “inflation reduction act” into law the inflation reduction act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax the “corporate amt” of 15 on the adjusted financial statement income “afsi” of corporations with average afsi exceeding 10 billion over a threeyear period the corporate amt is effective for the company beginning in fiscal 2024 we are evaluating the corporate amt and its potential impact on our future us tax expense cash taxes and effective tax rate additionally the inflation reduction act imposes an excise tax of 1 tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after december 31 2022 the impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods 

other trends and uncertainties 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges include dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the market shift of workloads to cloudrelated information technology it infrastructure business models emergence of softwaredefined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality and growth in it consumption models certain of our legacy hardware server and storage businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products therefore the demand environment for traditional server and storage products is challenging and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is impacting support attach opportunities within the associated services organization 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors 

a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution we provide our customers with a choice between traditional consumption models or software consumptionbased payperuse and asaservice offerings across our entire portfolio of hpe products and services 

additionally the global pandemic has accelerated several trends relevant to the company first the exponential increase of data at the edge driven by the proliferation of devices second the need for a cloud experience everywhere to manage the growth of data at the edge third data growth is creating new opportunities with the need to quickly extract value from the captured data enterprises have embraced multicloud strategies as they recognize the need for different cloud environments for different types of data and workloads increasingly customers want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the it they use 

in response to the aforementioned challenges we are accelerating our development and innovation efforts in the areas of our strategic focus including the intelligent edge and hpc  ai businesses while at the same time strengthening our core compute and storage businesses by investing in key areas of growth and accelerating our asaservice pivot to become the edgetocloud company for our customers and partners with our hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform 

during the fiscal period we announced significant advancements to our hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform our flagship hybrid offering that enables organizations to modernize all their applications and data from edge to cloud and supports multicloud experiences everywhere – including clouds that live onpremises at the edge in a colocation facility and in a public cloud the platform advancements included a unified operating experience with one view of all services edge to cloud along with convergence with the aruba central cloud service twelve new cloud services including network asaservice data services high performance computing functions compute operations management and availability of the hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform in the online marketplaces of several leading distributors we also launched hpe greenlake for private cloud enterprise which is a private cloud experience for traditional and cloudnative workloads these updates strengthen the hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform and help customers drive their data modernization needs 

the following executive overview results of operations and liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2021 unless otherwise noted the capital resources and cash requirements and commitments sections present information as of october 31 2022 unless otherwise noted 

executive overview 

net revenue of 285 billion represented an increase of 26 increased 51 on a constant currency basis as robust demand reflected by a high order backlog was moderated by a combination of unfavorable currency fluctuations ongoing supply chain constraints and lower revenue from russia the net revenue increase was led by effective pricing management in server products and strong demand for networking products the gross profit margin of 334 or 95 billion represents a decrease of 03 percentage points and was primarily driven by a combination of supply chain constraints and related cost increases higher costs in hpc  ai and unfavorable currency fluctuations moderating the gross profit decrease was pricing discipline and strong cost management in server products the operating profit margin of 27 represents a decrease of 14 percentage points primarily due to goodwill impairment charges for the hpc  ai and software businesses the decrease in o perating profit margin was primarily moderated by lower transformation costs we generated 46 billion of cash flow from operations and 18 billion of free cash flows primarily due to improved working capital management

annualized revenue runrate arr 

our pivot to asaservice continues its strong momentum with the addition of hpe greenlake cloud services our mix of arr is becoming more softwarerich as we build our hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform which is improving our margin profile on the innovation front we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings our cloud operations model to wherever data lives by unifying data operations the platform will be available through hpe greenlake central and includes a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure at scale we will continue to invest aggressively in hpe greenlake cloud services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model whether at the edge onpremises or across multiple clouds 

arr represents the annualized revenue of all net hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform services revenue related financial services revenue which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases and softwareasaservice software consumption revenue and other asaservice offerings recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four we use arr as a performance metric arr should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

the following presents our arr as of october 31 2022 and 2021 

the 17 year over year increase in arr represents growth from our hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform and related financial services the growth in the hpe greenlake edgetocloud platform was due to an expanding customer installed base moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations supply chain constraints and related installation delays at the segment level the growth is led by storage asaservice including zerto and intelligent edge asaservice activity 

returning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework which also consists of strategic investments we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents along with commercial paper and other shortterm liquidity arrangements are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs capital asset purchases dividends debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations as of october 31 2022 our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash were 476 billion compared to 433 billion as of october 31 2021 representing an increase of 043 billion 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities a summary of significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements are included in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 

we believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

revenue recognition 

we enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products andor various services 

the majority of our revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and maintenance and such revenue is recognized when or as control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers partners and distributors and may include rebates volumebased discounts cooperative marketing price protection and other incentive programs 

significant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these programs applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur we also consider the customers right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

to recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis we establish ssp for most of our products and services based on the observable price of the products or services when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers when the ssp is not directly observable we estimate ssp based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives pricing strategies marketcompetitive conditions historical profitability data as well as other observable inputs we establish ssp ranges for our products and services and reassesses them periodically 

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future sources of taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the us we will remit nonindefinitely reinvested earnings of our nonus subsidiaries for which deferred us state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations tax or cash management reasons 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 90 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our provision benefit for taxes net earnings loss and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies for further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 taxes on earnings to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii

we review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test 

as of october 31 2022 our reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 2 segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii with the exception of corporate investments and other which contains three reporting units software cms and a  ps 

when performing the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount an impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived mostly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach with the exception of the software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived mostly from the market approach under the income approach the fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted cash flow analysis of managements shortterm and longterm forecast of operating performance this analysis includes significant assumptions 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

regarding revenue growth rates expected operating margins and timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions and customer acceptances the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach the fair value is based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit 

our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for goodwill related to the hpc  ai and software reporting units there was no impairment of goodwill for our other reporting units 

the decline in the fair value of the hpc  ai reporting unit below its carrying value resulted from changes in expected future cash flows as compared to our fiscal 2021 longterm plan due to the continuation of supply chain constraints and other operational challenges as well as an increase in cost of capital prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test we tested the recoverability of longlived assets and other assets of the hpc  ai reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 815 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 

the hpc  ai reporting unit has remaining goodwill allocated of 29 billion as of october 31 2022 and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 0 as of the annual test date the hpc  ai business is facing challenges reflected in the results for the year ended october 31 2022 the challenges are primarily related to supply chain constraints and other operational challenges impacting our ability to achieve certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines we currently believe these challenges will be successfully addressed when supply chain constraints ease if the global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen projected revenue growth rates or operating margins decline weighted average cost of capital increases or if we have significant or sustained decline in our stock price it is possible our estimates about the hpc  ai reporting units ability to successfully address the current challenges may change which could result in the carrying value of the hpc  ai reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value and potential impairment charges 

the decline in the fair value of the software reporting unit resulted primarily from a decline in market multiples prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test we tested the recoverability of longlived assets and other assets of the software reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 90 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 

the software reporting unit has remaining goodwill allocated of 123 million as of october 31 2022 and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 0 as of the annual test date as noted above the software reporting unit relies significantly on the market approach which is impacted by market volatility if global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen and cause a further decline in equity market or if revenue expectations are not met this could result in the carrying value of the software reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value and potential impairment charges 

the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units excluding hpc  ai and software ranged from approximately 22 to 142 of the respective carrying amounts in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our other reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit based on the results of this hypothetical 10 decrease all of the other reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount 

contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case 

based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in note 17 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii are 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2022 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements 

results of operations 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of a current year revenue converted to us dollars using the prioryear periods foreign currency exchange rates divided by b the prioryear period revenue this information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows

fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 

net revenue 

in fiscal 2022 total net revenue of 285 billion increased by 07 billion or 26 increased 51 on a constant currency basis us net revenue increased by 06 billion or 65 to 94 billion while net revenue from outside of the us increased by 01 billion or 07 to 191 billion 

from a segment perspective net revenue increased across many of our segments due to the improved demand environment led by revenue growth of 11 4 and 03 in intelligent edge compute and hpc  ai respectively and decreased 7 2 1 in corporate investments and other financial services and storage respectively 

the components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows 

gross profit 

for the twelve months ended october 31 2022 the total gross profit margin of 334 represents a decrease of 03 percentage points compared to the prioryear period the decrease was primarily driven by a combination of supply chain constraints and related cost increases higher costs in hpc  ai and unfavorable currency fluctuations with costs from expected credit losses related to exiting our russia and belarus businesses adding to the overall decline moderating the gross profit decrease was pricing discipline and strong cost management in server products 

operating expenses 

research and development rd 

rd expense increased by 66 million or 3 due primarily to higher overall employee compensation expense which contributed 18 percentage points to the change and a combination of higher facilities expense training and travel expenses and software expenditures which in total contributed 13 percentage points to the change 

selling general and administrative sga 

sga expense increased by 12 million or 02 due primarily to higher travel expense as the economy reopens and covid19 restrictions ease higher software expenditures and the release of bad debt reserves in the prioryear period which contributed 12 percentage points 05 percentage points and 03 percentage points to the change respectively the increase was partially offset by a combination of lower employee cost driven by lower variable compensatio n expense and cost savings from our transformation programs which in total contributed 19 percentage points to the change additionally the overall increase in sga expense was moderated across various expense categories by favorable currency fluctuations 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization expense decreased by 61 million or 17 due to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods moderated by an increase in amortization expense in the current period resulting 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

from recent acquisitions additionally the decrease in the current fiscal period was due to certain writeoffs taken in the prior fiscal period 

impairment of goodwill 

impairment of goodwill for fiscal 2022 represents a partial goodwill impairment charge of 905 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as it was determined that the fair value of the hpc  ai and software reporting units was below the carrying value of their net assets refer to note 11 goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii for more information 

transformation programs and costs 

our transformation programs consist of the cost optimization and prioritization plan launched in 2020 and the hpe next initiative launched in 2017 

transformation costs decreased by 457 million or 49 due primarily to lower restructuring charges recorded in the current fiscal period as restructuring actions related to employee severance infrastructure and other under the cost optimization and prioritization plan are approaching completion primarily in fiscal 2023 for a further discussion refer to note 3 “transformation programs to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii 

interest and other net 

interest and other net expense decreased by 23 million due primarily to early debt redemption costs incurred in the prioryear period while in the currentyear period a combination of higher gains from the sale of certain assets lower interest expense from lower average borrowings and increased interest income from higher interest rates contributed to the net expense decline this decline was moderated by the current period containing lower gains from equity investments and unfavorable currency fluctuations 

tax indemnification and related adjustments 

we record changes in certain preseparation tax liabilities for which we shared joint and several liability with hp inc and for which we were indemnified under the termination and mutual release agreement within tax indemnification and related adjustments we also record changes to certain preseparation and predivestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business but which may not be subject to indemnification 

we recorded tax indemnification and related adjustments expense of 67 million and income of 65 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively 

tax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2022 resulted from changes in certain preseparation tax liabilities for which we partially shared joint and several liability with hp inc and for which we were indemnified under the termination and mutual release agreement and changes to certain predivestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables 

tax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2021 primarily included the impacts of a brazilian supreme court decision received regarding the base on which two social contribution taxes in brazil pis and cofins are imposed as a result of this decision the company is entitled to recover credits and associated interest related to the overpayment of these transaction taxes imposed between 2005 and 2019 to be used to offset future brazilian tax liabilities as such we have recorded benefits of 17 million and 80 million both net of taxes for the recovery of pis and cofins respectively during fiscal 2021 of which 25 million was included in net revenue 10 million related to interest income was included in interest and other net and 80 million related to preseparation liabilities was included in tax indemnification and related adjustments the corresponding income taxes of 18 million as a result of this recovery were included in provision benefit for taxes in the consolidated statement of earnings 

nonservice net periodic benefit credit 

nonservice net periodic benefit credit represents the components of net periodic pension benefit costs other than service cost for the hewlett packard enterprise defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans such as interest cost expected return on plan assets and the amortization of prior plan amendments and actuarial gains or losses the credit also includes the impact of any plan settlements curtailments or special termination benefits 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

nonservice net periodic benefit credit increased by 64 million due primarily to lower amortized actuarial losses partially offset by higher interest cost due to higher discount rates and lower expected returns on assets in the current period 

litigation judgment 

litigation judgment represents the 235 billion settlement we received in october 2021 in relation to the itanium litigation judgment the gain was recognized as other income and presented as a litigation judgment in the consolidated statements of earnings in the prioryear perio d for further discussion refer to note 17 “litigation and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii 

earnings from equity interests 

earnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49 interest in h3c technologies and the amortization of our interest in a basis difference earnings from equity interests increased by 35 million due primarily to lower amortization expense from basis difference and higher net income earned by h3c in the current period partially offset by gains from certain venture investments in the prioryear period 

provision benefit for taxes 

for fiscal 2022 and 2021 we recorded income tax expense of 8 million and 160 million respectively which reflect effective tax rates of 09 and 45 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year our tax rate for fiscal 2022 also included the effects of the nondeductible goodwill impairment the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include puerto rico and singapore 

in fiscal 2022 we recorded 454 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year these amounts primarily included

compute 



fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 

compute net revenue increased by 458 million or 37 increased 60 on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher average unit prices resulting from a combination of increased sales of server configurations with more complex component architectures in our next generation products and disciplined pricing actions the net revenue increase was moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations and lower unit shipments resulting from supply constraints due to the challenging supply chain environment as a result we ended the period with a high level of order backlog 

compute experienced product revenue growth in the rack and synergy server categories moderated by a revenue decline due to certain products approaching their endoflife services net revenue declined primarily due to lower revenue from russia and the impact of delayed hardware shipments on services contracts

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

financing volume which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services including intercompany activity increased by 14 in fiscal 2022 as compared to the prioryear period the increase was primarily driven by higher financing associated with thirdparty product sales and related service offerings partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations and lower financing of hpe product sales and related service offerings 

portfolio assets and ratios 

the fs business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system the accounting policies used to derive fs amounts are substantially the same as those used by the company however intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

current overview 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures product development initiatives acquisitions and disposal activities including legal settlements restructuring activities transformation costs indemnifications maturing debt interest payments and income tax payments in addition to any future investments share repurchases and stockholder dividend payments we expect to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary by accessing the capital markets issuing commercial paper and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions however our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions we anticipate that the funds made available and cash generated from operations along with our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter we continue to monitor the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the us and other global economies the capital markets consumer behavior our businesses results of operations financial condition and cash flows our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with a substantial amount held outside the us as of october 31 2022 we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed 

amounts held outside of the us are generally utilized to support our nonus liquidity needs repatriations of amounts held outside the us generally will not be taxable from a us federal tax perspective but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the us and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on the repatriation of amounts held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

in connection with the share repurchase program previously authorized by our board of directors during fiscal 2022 we repurchased and settled an aggregate amount of 05 billion as of october 31 2022 we had a remaining authorization of 14 billion for future share repurchases for more information on our share repurchase program refer to note 15 stockholders equity to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii

the tables below represent the way in which management reviews cash flows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decrease d by 13 billion for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 the decrease was primarily due to 22 billion of aftertax cash resulting from a litigation judgment in the prioryear period lower variable compensation accruals and favorable hedging positions moderated by improved working capital and a decrease in financing receivables as compared to the prioryear period 

our working capital metrics and cash conversion impacts were as follows 



the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers early or late invoice payments from customers or to suppliers the

extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends the timing of sales and inventory purchases within the period the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity 

dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for the threemonth period ending october 31 2022 as compared to the corresponding prioryear period dso decreased by 2 days due primarily to favorable billings linearity higher early collections and receivables factoring partially offset by extended payment terms 

dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for the threemonth period ending october 31 2022 as compared to the corresponding prioryear period dos in creased by 6 days due primarily to higher levels of inventory resulting from a combination of supply chain constraints positioning of inventory to fulfill planned future shipments and strategic purchases of certain key components 

dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for the threemonth period ending october 31 2022 as compared to the corresponding prioryear period dpo increased by 21 days due primarily to proactive measures we have taken to secure key materials for future shipments and a larger proportion of vendors with longer payment terms 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 07 billion in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 the change was primarily due to a combinaton of lower payments in connection with business acquisitions of 05 billion lower cash utilized in net financial collateral activities of 03 billion and higher proceeds from the sale of investments net of purchases of 03 billion partially offset by higher cash utilized for investment in property plant and equipment net of sales proceeds of 04 billion as compared to the prioryear period 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 16 billion in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 the decrease was due primarily to lower net debt repayments of 19 billion and higher cash utilized for share repurchases of 03 billion as compared to the prioryear period

free cash flow represents cash flow from operations excluding the impact of 22 billion in proceeds received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 from a onetime itanium litigation judgment less net capital expenditures investments in property plant and equipment “ppe” less proceeds from the sale of ppe and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash free cash flow increased by 02 billion in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to higher cash generated from operating activities excluding a onetime litigation judgment led by improved net working capital management moderated by increased cash used for investments in property plant and equipment net of sales proceeds

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis nongaap gross profit nongaap gross profit margin nongaap earnings from operations nongaap operating profit margin nongaap earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue nongaap net earnings nongaap diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow these nongaap financial measures are used by management for purposes of evaluating our historical and prospective financial performance as well as evaluating our performance relative to our competitors these nongaap financial measures are not computed in accordance with or as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the gaap measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap gross profit is gross profit the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap gross profit margin is gross profit margin the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap earnings from operations is earnings from operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap operating profit margin nongaap earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue is operating profit margin earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap net earnings is net earnings the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share the gaap measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations 

net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prioryear period nongaap gross profit and nongaap gross profit margin is defined to exclude charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs stockbased compensation expense and disaster charges nongaap earnings from operations and nongaap operating profit margin nongaap earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue consist of earnings from operations excluding any charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill transformation costs disaster charges stockbased compensation expense and acquisition disposition and other related charges nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges as well as items such as tax indemnification and related adjustments nonservice net periodic benefit credit litigation judgment early debt redemption costs earnings from equity interests certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes the impact of tax reform structural rate adjustment and excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation in addition nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each nongaap item we believe that excluding the items mentioned above from these nongaap financial measures allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of our segments management believes excluding these items facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance in comparison to our peers 

these nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of the limitations in relying on these nongaap financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent gaap earnings measures and cash flows they may be calculated differently by other companies and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets 

we compensate for these limitations on the use of nongaap financial measures by relying primarily on our gaap results and using nongaap financial measures only as a supplement we also provide a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure we believe that providing net revenue on a constant currency basis nongaap gross profit nongaap gross profit margin nongaap earnings from operations nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net earnings nongaap diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow in addition to the related gaap measures provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows the reader of our consolidated financial statements to see our financial results “through the eyes” of management 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2022 were the euro japanese yen and british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and from time to time options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales operating expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2022 and 2021 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2022 and 2021 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 49 million and 35 million at october 31 2022 and 2021 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued our investment portfolio and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing 

we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar based floating or fixed interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however in circumstances where we believe additional fixedrate debt would be beneficial we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap or swap certain floating interest payments to fixed 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of interest income received on certain variablerate investments by entering into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2022 and 2021 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2022 and 2021 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 32 million and 58 million at october 31 2022 and 2021 respectively

covid19 pandemic update 

while great progress has been made in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic covid19 or pandemic it remains a global challenge in fiscal 2021 due to an unprecedented demand for electronic devices and related industrywide supply constraints the global economy encountered a challenging supply chain environment the pandemic continues to have an impact on our financial performance and we are currently unable to predict the extent to which it may adversely impact our future business operations financial performance and results of operations for a further discussion of the risks uncertainties and actions taken in response to covid19 see risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in part i item 1a 

in 2021 covid19 vaccines were broadly distributed and administered and beginning october 4 2021 we adopted a policy to require proof of vaccination from hpe personnel contingent workers and guests in order to return to our sites where permitted by local laws and regulations and on the timeline determined appropriate for the geography as of end of fiscal 2021 the policy was operationalized only in the us on october 20 2021 we updated our vaccination policy to require vaccination as a condition of employment for all hpe personnel covered by president bidens executive order effective january 18 2022 we recognize that there are existing legal challenges to the executive order and we will ensure that the timing and scope of the implementation of our vaccination requirement is consistent with the legal status of the executive order we are committed to help support costs for the vaccine through hpe health benefits or other programs to the extent not covered by government programs medical plans or other sources 

our strategy 

the pace of technology disruption continues to increase and the pandemic has accelerated several megatrends first data at the edge is increasing exponentially driven by the proliferation of devices secure connectivity is essential to enable the digital experiences we now rely on – and power new engaging digital experiences in the future second enterprises need a cloud experience everywhere to manage data and workloads wherever they live across a distributed enterprise third data growth is creating countless new opportunities enterprises need ways to generate insights from this data to build new business models across these trends is the shift in how enterprises are consuming their technology increasingly customers want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the it they use 

data insights are critical to deliver business outcomes but extracting value from data is challenging data is growing and evolving rapidly its characteristics are shifting as it becomes more unstructured more timesensitive and more distributed frequently data is siloed and spread across different multigen it systems often trapped in critical legacy architecture many organizations cannot adequately extract insights from their data at the edge or face cloud migration challenges because of their legacy applications customers need a datafirst modernization approach across edge to data center to cloud 

we declared our vision to be the edgetocloud company our hpe greenlake platform accelerates multigeneration it transformation through a unified cloud services experience that enables customers to access control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data our solutions across connectivity cloud and data – which are increasingly being delivered asaservice through hpe greenlake – are complemented by hpe pointnext services that provide unique transformation capabilities as well as hpe financial services which helps customers unlock financial capacity

• open platforms the world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a future of centers of data everywhere which are highly decentralized and distributed this shift demands a common cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to the customers data sources to create realtime insights everywhere many of our competitors want to lock customers into a cloud stack conversely we believe that the cloud experience should be open and seamless across all our customers clouds — and the best cloud transformation partner is one who is unbiased and offers choice we are unique in our ability to enable any hybrid cloud strategy and a consistent experience that is open to any cloud and differentiated with our partner integrations 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups including business and public sector enterprises and purchases of our products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

• resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups 

• distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers 

• original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products and services with their own products and services and sell the integrated solution 

• independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products 

• systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and 

• advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services 

the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses this has resulted in a combined gotomarket model in which we have a direct sales presence in a number of countries while we sell and deliver our products solutions and services through a channelonly model in the remaining countries in those countries where we have a direct sales presence we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers as well as with large public sector accounts the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smaller accounts both in the commercial and public sector space 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design the use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand in addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

historically we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on singlesource suppliers for certain customized parts although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption and a disruption or loss of a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products in some instances our singlesource suppliers eg intel and amd as suppliers of certain x86 processors are also the singlesource suppliers for the entire market disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are geographically concentrated when necessary we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly in item 1a 

as a result of the pandemic the industry is being impacted by an increased worldwide demand for electronic components that is anticipated to last at least through the end of this calendar year this global shortage impacts hpe and the technology market segment as a whole while we anticipate further industrywide tightening we took proactive inventory buffering measures in order to position us well during the second half of the fiscal year and going forward we will take additional inventory actions as appropriate in alignment to the market demand and will continue to leverage strong partnerships and longterm agreements with our suppliers 

backlog 

backlog represents the price of orders related to current or prior periods for which work has not been performed or goods have not been delivered as of the reporting period 

the higher levels of backlog we experienced in the prioryear period due to the pandemic were largely delivered by the end of fiscal 2020 at the same time the global pandemic resulted in an unprecedented demand for electronic devices which coupled with related industrywide supply constraints has led to a challenging supply chain environment additionally the pandemic continues to play a role with ongoing delays to the global logistics environment as a result in the second half of fiscal 2021 we experienced a shortage of electric components and logistics timing issues which resulted in significantly higher levels of order backlog and commodity costs across our hardware segments and particularly in compute storage and intelligent edge currently we expect these challenging supply chain conditions to persist in the near term 

during the pandemic we have also viewed backlog as an indication of demand health as governments around the world continue to impose restrictions on nonessential work activities and travel as and when the pandemic subsides our focus on backlog may again become less relevant as a reliable indicator of future demand 

for a further discussion of the risks uncertainties and actions taken in response to the pandemic see risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products 

a summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in note 2 segment information to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii approximately 68 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2021 came from sales outside the united states 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and —we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a of part ii and note 13 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which are incorporated herein by reference

in hewlett packard labs we are focused on disruptive innovation and applied research in collaboration with other hpe business groups to deliver differentiated intellectual property ip our innovation agenda is focused on developing technologies in the areas of system architecture networking ai accelerators and silicon photonics we also continue to invest in our silicon design capability to accelerate the development and delivery of our technology with custom integrated circuits 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our rd activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer in item 1a 

patents 

our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position as of october 31 2021 our worldwide patent portfolio included approximately 13000 issued and pending patents 

patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend and —our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties in item 1a 

seasonality 

from time to time the markets in which we sell our products services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months however the pandemic resulted in a temporary disruption to the seasonal fluctuation of our business see risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a 

competition 

we have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise it infrastructure products solutions and services we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business we compete primarily on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our it infrastructure offerings 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are relatively short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services continuously enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above among others in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

the competitive environments in which our segments operate are described below

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating hewlett packard enterprise and its common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k 

business and operational risks 

we are unable to predict the extent to which the ongoing global covid19 pandemic may adversely impact our business operations financial performance and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations the pandemic has resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity including travel restrictions prohibitions of nonessential activities in some cases disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control including the various restrictions imposed by cities counties states and countries on our employees customers partners and suppliers designed to limit the spread of covid19 although the immediate impacts of the covid19 pandemic have been assessed the longterm magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity is still highly uncertain and cannot currently be predicted 

in response to the covid19 pandemic and to ensure the safety of our employees we have implemented a global workfromhome policy until further notice that applies to a significant majority of our employees with the exception of those performing essential activities most recently we have announced a vaccination requirement for covered us employees as required by executive order 14042 for federal contractors we recognize that there are existing legal challenges to executive order 14042 and we will ensure that the timing and scope of the implementation of our vaccination requirement is consistent with the legal status of executive order 14042 our employees may elect to return to the office in jurisdictions where both local requirements and our own health and safety standards have been met as such instances occur employees have returned to the office in a phased process and remain subject to safety regimens anchored around vaccination or testing requirements as we determine is appropriate based on local conditions moreover certain industry and customer events that we sponsor or at which we present have been canceled postponed or moved to virtualonly experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter postpone or cancel entirely additional events in the future we are also seeing an increase in customer requirements for hpe employees to be vaccinated andor tested for covid19 before being able to enter customer sites which could potentially present an operational challenge also workfromhome and other modified business practices introduce additional operational risks including cybersecurity risks which may result in inefficiencies or delays and have affected the way we conduct our product development sales customer support and other activities unanticipated disruptions in services provided through our localized physical infrastructure caused by the covid19 pandemic can curtail the functioning of critical components of our it systems and adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders provide services respond to customer requests and maintain our worldwide business operations our implementation of employee vaccination requirements may result in attrition including attrition of critically skilled labor and difficulty securing future labor needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business by negatively impacting the demand for our products and services restricting our operations and sales marketing and distribution efforts disrupting the supply chains of hardware products and disrupting our research and development capabilities engineering design and manufacturing processes and other important business activities there have been and will continue to be delays of hardware product shipments from our vendors and out of our manufacturing operations worldwide as a result of capacity issues we also expect product shipment delays as a result of shortages and capacity issues that continue to impact logistics operations 

we expect the covid19 pandemic could continue to have a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict while such changes were factored into the forecast used to assess assets for reserves and impairment including goodwill any changes to the profitability for the next fiscal year could impact the realizability of assets additionally concerns over the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price our ability to access capital markets and our ability to fund liquidity needs 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and stock price it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this part i item 1a of this form 10k 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations and supply chain could be disrupted by natural or humaninduced disasters including but not limited to earthquakes tsunamis floods hurricanes cyclones or typhoons fires other extreme weather conditions power or water shortages telecommunications failures materials scarcity and price volatility terrorist acts civil unrest conflicts or wars and medical epidemics or pandemics we are predominantly selfinsured to mitigate the impact of most catastrophic events although it is impossible to completely predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events forecasting disruptive events and building additional resiliency into our operations accordingly will become an increasing business imperative the occurrence of business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations 

climate change serves as a risk multiplier increasing both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations our corporate headquarters is located in houston texas which suffers from floods hurricanes and other extreme weather and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california which suffers from drought conditions and catastrophic wildfires each affecting the health and safety of our employees in california to mitigate wildfire risk electric utilities are deploying public safety power shutoffs which affects electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities in 2017 our principal worldwide it data centers in houston were flooded due to hurricane harvey since then hpe has increased its resiliency through site selection and infrastructure technological investments to mitigate and adapt to physical risks from climate change 

the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including the united states czech republic mexico china malaysia taiwan and singapore we also rely on major logistics hubs which are strategically located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to hpes distribution channels and customers our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near vulnerable locations is continuing to be assessed 

our transition to a subscriptionconsumptionbased business model may adversely affect our business operating results and free cash flow 

we are currently transitioning to an asaservice company providing our entire portfolio through a range of subscriptionconsumptionbased payperuse and asaservice offerings we will also continue to provide our hardware and software in a capital expenditure and licensebased model ultimately giving our customers choices in consuming hpe products and services in a traditional or asaservice offering such business model changes entail significant risks and uncertainties and we may be unable to complete the transition to a subscriptionconsumptionbased business model or manage the transition successfully and in a timely manner and our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results may be adversely affected additionally we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the subscriptionconsumption transition even if we successfully complete the transition the transition to a subscriptionconsumptionbased business model also means that our historical results especially those achieved before we began the transition may not be indicative of our future results further as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings for which revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery and our asaservice offerings for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 

in addition the transition to an asaservice company is expected to require incremental capital requirements resulting in a negative impact to cash flows in the near term and may require us to dedicate additional resources including sales and marketing costs furthermore we anticipate needing to redesign our gotomarket structure to better align with the subscriptionconsumptionbased business model we must adapt our sales processes for new sales and marketing approaches including those required by our shift to subscriptionconsumption services and other changes resulting from the pandemic changing our gotomarket structure may affect employee compensation models and ultimately our ability to retain employees there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these adjustments in a timely or costeffective manner or that we will be able to realize all or any of the expected benefits from such adjustments further our subscriptionconsumption offerings could subject us to increased risk of liability related to the provision of services as well as operational technical legal or other costs 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers abilities to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of solutions that we offer the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain solutions problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply and contractual relational and labor risks each of which is described below 

• component shortages we have been and currently are experiencing delays and shortages of certain components as a result of strong demand and capacity constraints due to economic changes resulting from the covid19 pandemic disruptions in the operations of component suppliers and other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers a surge in demand for silicon has arisen across numerous markets affecting availability of key components of our products and our suppliers products which may adversely affect customer deliveries and our anticipated revenues as shortages or delays persist the price of certain components has increased and may continue to increase we may be exposed to quality issues or at some point the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays 

• excess supply in order to secure components for our products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into long term agreements or noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

• contractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

• contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws 

• singlesource suppliers we obtain certain components from singlesource suppliers due to technology availability price quality scale or customization needs replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may initially be unable to meet demand or be subject to other output limitations for some components such as customized components alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of a singlesource supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a singlesource supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a singlesource supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our periodic restructuring programs can be disruptive to our business 

we have announced restructuring plans including the hpe next initiative whereby we are simplifying our operating model and streamlining our offerings business processes and business systems and the cost optimization and prioritization plan in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs as well as simplify our organizational structure upgrade our it infrastructure and redesign business processes we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans the hpe next initiative and the cost optimization and prioritization plan see note 3 transformation programs to the consolidated financial statements 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our strategy we may acquire businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions and also handle any postclosing issues such as integration for example in september 2020 we acquired silver peak systems inc an sdwan industry leader and in september 2019 we acquired cray inc a global supercomputer leader in april 2017 and september 2017 we spun off our enterprise services and software businesses respectively see also the risk factors below under the heading risks related to prior separations 

risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our financial results including our effective tax rate 

• we may not successfully combine product or service offerings or fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction which may result in 1 failure to retain employees customers distributors and suppliers 2 increase in unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations which may cause financial results to differ from expectations and 3 significant increase in costs and expenses including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans 

• our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives we may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired companys product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or all of the factors necessary to estimate reasonably accurate costs timing and other matters 

• in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders or we may enter into financing arrangements which could affect our liquidity and financial condition 

• for an acquisition or other combination the acquisition partner may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls which could impact our exposure to data security incidents and potentially increase anticipated costs or time to integrate the business 

• business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation which could impact our financial condition and results of operations 

• we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

• for a divestiture we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated 

• the impact of divestitures on our revenue growth may be larger than projected as we may experience greater dissynergies than expected if we do not satisfy preclosing conditions and necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms it may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve 

continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

• our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult or discourage an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise if our board of directors deems it to be undesirable provisions such as indemnification meeting requirements and blank check stock authorizations could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests or changes in control or management of hewlett packard enterprise 

managements attention or other resources may be diverted during business combination and investment transactions and further impacted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives 

system security risks data protection incidents cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or it services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

as a leading technology firm we are exposed to attacks from criminals nation state actors and activist hackers collectively malicious parties who have been able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures although some of these attacks have caused disruptions or exposure of information so far these attacks have not resulted in material losses to hpe nor have any of hpes consumers customers or employees informed hpe that these attacks resulted in material harm to them it is possible that future attacks may result in material misappropriation system disruptions or shutdowns malicious alteration or destruction of our confidential or personal information or that of third parties malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain to embed malicious software or hardware in our products for use in compromising our customers in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our business may process store and transmit customer data including commercially sensitive and personal data subject to the european general data protection regulation and other privacy laws with our business increasingly providing cloud service offerings malicious parties could target such services potentially resulting in an increased risk of compromise of customer data and regulatory exposure incidents involving our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information sensitive confidential or personal data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in regulatory fines litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of managing an incident and implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we deliver global edgetocloud platform asaservice to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from all of their data everywhere hpe delivers unique open and intelligent technology solutions including those utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities with a consistent experience across all clouds and edge computing platforms to successfully execute this strategy we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by improving cost structure 

aligning sales coverage with strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing an edgetocloud platform asaservice solution and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered asaservice progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions should such efforts fail to produce actionable insights or our products not perform as promised our business results may be adversely affected any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

after we develop an edgetocloud platform product we must be able to scale quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer  

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including both direct and indirect distributors and resellers sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement moreover some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our 

significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation certain equitybased incentive awards for certain executives contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened 

our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

industry risks 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution product range and ease of use account relationships customer training service and support and security of our offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have vertical relationships in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have vertical relationships also may acquire or form relationships with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with vertical partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition 

competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products and services we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards software defined and public cloud which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products 

international risks 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates and costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses further ongoing us federal government spending priorities may limit demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions 

our business and financial performance also could be adversely affected by changes in us trade policy us export controls and sanctions and us regulations concerning imports as well as international laws and regulations relating to global trade current us government trade policy includes the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign goods including information and communication technology products these measures have materially increased costs for certain goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices result in lowering our margin on products sold us government trade policy has resulted in and could result in more us trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries similarly changes in regulations relating to exports could prevent us from exporting products to certain locations or customers entirely in addition changes in requirements relating to making foreign direct investments could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions 

sales outside the united states constituted approximately 68 of our net revenue in fiscal 2021 our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic 

• inflationary pressures such as those the market is currently experiencing which may increase costs for materials supplies and services 

• network security privacy and data sovereignty concerns which could make foreign customers reluctant to purchase products and services from usbased technology companies 

• longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers 

• local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and original equipment manufacturers oems or changes to immigration and labor law policies which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent 

• managing our geographically dispersed workforce 

• differing technology standards or customer requirements 

• difficulties associated with repatriating earnings in restricted countries and changes in tax laws and 

• fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments 

the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with anticorruption laws around the world including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act but in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies people may engage in business practices prohibited by anticorruption laws our employees and third parties we work with may take actions in violation of our policies and those actions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

intellectual property risks 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties for example many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become 

obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement including patent infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights patent assertion entities frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of extracting infringement settlements if we cannot license or replace allegedly infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products discontinue certain product offerings enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

financial risks 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service standard  poors ratings services and fitch ratings services despite these investment grade credit ratings any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts additionally increased borrowing costs including those arising from a credit rating downgrade can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

in addition to our current total carrying debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future this collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors including 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments 

• making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations 

• increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry and 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock 

to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks described above could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our 

outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to service or refinance our debt 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability variations in fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in addition newer geographic market opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our businesses our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition as discussed in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies—use of estimates and note 17 litigation and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

regulatory risks 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations such as those concerning environmental protection for example we face increasing complexity related to product design the use of regulated hazardous and scarce materials the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to the use of products the transportation and shipping of products climate change regulations and the reuse recycling andor disposal of products and their components at endofuse or useful life as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our transition to a more circular economy a significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales any changes to current environmental legal requirements such 

as the eu restriction of hazardous substances directive the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive or chinas regulation on management methods for controlling pollution caused by electronic information products among others may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the eu china andor other countries proposing or adopting similar environmental legal requirements in addition other esgrelated laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are being proposed adopted and implemented throughout the world including but not limited to the european commission’s proposal on sustainable corporate governance if we were to violate or become liable under environmental or certain esgrelated laws or if our products become noncompliant with such laws or market access requirements our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could incur costs or face other sanctions such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions fines andor civil or criminal sanctions environmental regulations may also impact the availability and cost of energy or emissions related to energy consumption which may increase our cost of manufacturing andor the cost of powering and cooling owned it infrastructures 

in addition our business is subject to an evergrowing number of laws addressing privacy and information security in particular we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings if we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy or security we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions our potential exposure includes regulatory fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims and reputational damage 

failure to comply with government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various government procurement laws and regulations required contract provisions and other requirements relating to contract formation administration and performance any violation of government contracting laws and regulations or contract terms could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and fines treble damages and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition we will continue to be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new government contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the united states has proposed changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these proposals if finalized and adopted by the associated countries would impose a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

the us house of representatives has passed legislation consistent with the framework president biden announced previously which includes a number of changes that would impact the us federal taxation of corporations among other items the legislation includes provisions that would raise the tax rate on foreign income of us corporations apply the global intangible lowtax income regime on a countrybycountry basis impose a new alternative minimum tax on book income and impose a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks the us senate has not voted on or agreed to the legislation but if this happens and president biden signs it into law it could materially impact our tax provision cash tax liability and effective tax rate 

during fiscal 2019 we executed a termination and mutual release agreement which terminated our tax matters agreement with hp inc because we now have limited indemnity rights from hp inc we potentially bear more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments 

risks related to prior separations 

the stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment could result in significant tax liability and dxc or micro focus as applicable may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us 

the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our software segment were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of i the relevant distribution and related transactions as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 368a 361 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the code and ii the relevant merger as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code while the software separation generally qualified for taxfree treatment for us seattle spinco and micro focus the acquisition of seattle spinco by micro focus resulted in the recognition of gain but not loss for us persons who received micro focus american depositary shares in the software separation 

each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us everett spinco and csc or us seattle spinco and micro focus as applicable if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized notwithstanding the opinions of counsel the internal revenue service the irs could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position 

if the distribution of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who receive everett spinco shares or seattle spinco shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

we obtained private letter rulings from the irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation of our enterprise services business and software segment those rulings concluded that certain transactions in those separations are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the conclusions of the irs private letter rulings were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete the validity of the irs private letter rulings may be affected notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment including nonus tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material if the completed separation of our former enterprise services business or software segment including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those separations are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor dxc andor micro focus could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

under the tax matters agreements entered into by us with everett spinco and csc and with seattle spinco and micro focus everett spinco and seattle spinco generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by or acquisitions of capital stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable any such indemnity obligations could be material 

we continue to face a number of risks related to the separation from our former parent including those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and shared use of certain intellectual property rights which could in the future adversely impact our reputation 

in connection with the separation hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc entered into several agreements that determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations in these agreements hp inc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify hp inc for certain liabilities including crossindemnities that are designed and intended to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of hp incs business with hp inc we may be obligated to fully indemnify hp inc for certain liabilities under the 

separation agreements or hp inc may not be able to fully cover their indemnification obligations to us under the same separation agreements each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the terms of the separation also include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively as a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hp inc could also adversely affect the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise 

general risks 

our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows our stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile and can be affected by among other things speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by us or our competitors our quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us the financial results and business strategies of our competitors inflation developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes or the timing and amount of our share repurchases general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hewlett packard enterprises performance also may affect the price of hewlett packard enterprises stock volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

other trends and uncertainties 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges include dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the market shift of workloads to cloudrelated it infrastructure business models emergence of softwaredefined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality and growth in it consumption models certain of our legacy hardware server and storage businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products therefore the demand environment for traditional server and storage products is challenging and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is impacting support attach opportunities within the associated services organization 

another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors 

a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution we intend to provide our customers with a choice between traditional consumption models or subscriptionbased payperuse and asaservice offerings across our entire portfolio of hpe products and services 

additionally the global pandemic has accelerated several trends relevant to the company first the exponential increase of data at the edge driven by the proliferation of devices second is the need for a cloud experience everywhere to manage the growth of data at the edge third data growth is creating new opportunities with the need to quickly extract value from the captured data enterprises have embraced multicloud strategies as they recognize the need for different cloud environments for different types of data and workloads increasingly customers want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the it they use 

in response to the aforementioned challenges and trends we are accelerating growth in our areas of strategic focus which include the intelligent edge and high performance computing and artificial intelligence hpc  ai businesses while at the same time we are strengthening our core compute and storage businesses doubling down in key areas of growth and accelerating our asaservice pivot to become the edgetocloud platformasaservice choice for our customers and partners  

at the same time our transformation programs have improved our cost structure channel execution and alignment of our sales coverage with our strategic goals we continue to pursue new product innovations that build on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking which will keep us aligned with market demand industry trends and the needs of our customers and partners in addition we continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies 

examples of accelerating and strengthening growth in our segments include the following 

• intelligent edge  we are seeing continued traction from our investment at the edge including rich software capabilities in security and edge services from hpe aruba the aruba edge services platform esp with aruba’s builtin identitybased network security is unique in the market and provides the ideal foundation for building a zero trust and secure access service edge our comprehensive portfolio and artificial intelligencepowered clouddriven platforms such as aruba esp and aruba central will continue to accelerate wan and security deployments advance cloud and iot adoption and fasttrack digital transformation we are on track to grow highmargin recurring revenue with technology that accelerates our ability to capture the highgrowth wan market opportunity additionally we introduced a new class of cloudnative and fully automated data center switching products specifically designed for edge cloud data centers which represents a significant market opportunity for hpe 

• hpc  ai  enterprises are running analytics on increasingly large data sets and are adopting new techniques such as ai deep learning and machine learning they now will have access to hpc technologies including exascale supercomputing systems that were historically prohibitive due to their cost and complexity hpe greenlake cloud services is a flexible asaservice platform that customers can run onpremises or in a colocation facility 

• compute  our strategy to grow profitability and pivot to more asaservice solutions is paying off compute includes three new hpe proliant solutions targeting 5g deployments for telecommunication companies and virtual desktop infrastructure we launched our new hpe 5g open radio access network ran solution stack for telecommunications companies to accelerate the commercial adoption of open ran in 5g network deployments this

is a transformative technology featuring the industry’s first serveroptimized for 5g open ran workloads with our hpe proliant servers 

• storage  we continue to see strength in key software defined solutions which drive our ability to attach rich services and provide data insights with our portfolio offerings we introduced a new portfolio of cloud native data infrastructure called hpe alletra which delivers workload optimized systems and provides customers with architectural flexibility to run any application without compromise from edgetocloud with our operational experience these innovations are propelling our storage business into a cloudnative softwaredefined data services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions 

annualized revenue runrate arr 

our pivot to asaservice continues its strong momentum with the addition of hpe greenlake cloud services our mix of arr is becoming more softwarerich as we build our greenlake cloud platform which is improving our margin profile on the innovation front we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings our cloud operations model to wherever data lives by unifying data operations the platform will be available through hpe greenlake central and include a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure at scale we will continue to invest aggressively in hpe greenlake cloud services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model whether at the edge onpremises or across multiple clouds 

arr represents the annualized revenue of all net greenlake services revenue related financial services revenue which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from capital leases and softwareasaservice subscription and other asaservice offerings recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four we use arr as a performance metric arr should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it 

the following presents our arr as of october 31 2021 and 2020 

the 36 increase in arr in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prioryear period was due to growth in hpe greenlake services and related financial services due to an expanding customer installed base additionally arr increased due to higher intelligent edge asaservice activity including silver peak and growth in storage asaservice driven by zerto a recent acquisition

executive overview 

net revenue of 278 billion represented an increase of 30 increased 10 on a constant currency basis due to a variety of factors including improvements in the overall demand environment from the prioryear period resulting in revenue growth across most of our segments a strong order backlog at the beginning of the period incremental revenue from the silver peak acquisition and favorable currency fluctuations the revenue increase was moderated by a decrease in unit shipments due largely to industrywide material constraints and a related challenging supply chain environment which resulted in significantly higher levels of order backlog across our hardware segments at the end of the current period the gross profit margin of 337 represented an increase of 23 percentage points due to a combination of factors led by strong pricing discipline cost savings from our transformation programs and a continued mix shift toward highermargin softwarerich offerings the operating profit margin of 41 represented an increase of 53 percentage points due primarily to our strong operational execution in fiscal 2021 and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge which we recognized in fiscal 2020 we generated 59 billion of cash flow from operations including 22 billion of aftertax cash from oracle corporations satisfaction of a judgment in the itanium breach of contract litigation due to higher net earnings and improved working capital management free cash flow excluding the litigation judgment was 16 billion

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities a summary of significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements are included in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 

we believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

revenue recognition 

we enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products andor various services 

the majority of our revenue is derived from sales of product and the associated support and maintenance which is recognized when or as control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers partners and distributors and may include rebates volumebased discounts cooperative marketing price protection and other incentive programs 

significant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these programs applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur we also consider the customers right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable 

to recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price ssp basis we establish ssp for most of our products and services based on the observable price of the products or services when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers when the ssp is not directly observable we estimate ssp based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives pricing strategies marketcompetitive conditions historical profitability data as well as other observable inputs we establish ssp ranges for our products and services and reassesses them periodically 

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we will adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future sources of taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the us we will remit nonindefinitely reinvested earnings of our nonus subsidiaries for which deferred us state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations tax or cash management reasons 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 90 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our provision benefit for taxes net earnings loss and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies for further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 taxes on earnings to the consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test 

in the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach with the exception of the software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived most significantly from the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations including revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows these cash flow projections are discounted to arrive at the fair value of each reporting unit the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit 

on march 31 2020 due to the macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic on our projected future results of operations we determined that an indicator of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test for its reporting units the quantitative goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the hpc  ai reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 865 million as a result we recorded a partial goodwill impairment charge of 865 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 

during the annual impairment test in fiscal 2020 we determined that no additional impairment of goodwill existed 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 did not result in any additional impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 8 to 133 of the respective carrying amounts in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit based on the results of this hypothetical 10 decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount with the exception of hpc  ai reporting unit 

as of the annual test date the hpc  ai reporting unit had a goodwill of 37 billion and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 8 the hpc  ai business is facing challenges on the current and projected future results as the revenue growth is dependent on timing of delivery and related achievement of customer acceptance milestones if we are not successful in addressing these challenges the projected revenue growth rates or operating margins could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the hpc  ai reporting unit the fair value of the hpc  ai reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by changes in its weighted average cost of capital changes in managements business strategy or significant and sustained declines in the stock price which could result in an indicator of impairment further impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position see part i item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the potential impacts of the pandemic on the fair value of our assets 

intangible assets 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach 

in march 2020 prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test we tested the recoverability of longlived assets and other assets of the hpc  ai reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired 

contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case 

based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in note 17 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2021 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and doesnt adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of a current year revenue converted to us dollars using the prioryear periods foreign currency exchange rates divided by b prioryear period revenue this information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows 



fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 

net revenue 

in fiscal 2021 total net revenue of 278 billion increased by 08 billion or 30 increased 10 on a constant currency basis us net revenue decreased by 03 billion or 34 to 89 billion while net revenue from outside of the us increased by 11 billion or 63 to 189 billion 

from a segment perspective net revenue increased across most of our segments due to the improved demand environment led by revenue growth of 15 in intelligent edge and 5 3 2 and 2 in corporate investments and other 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

hpc  ai storage and financial service respectively compute net revenue was largely unchanged from the prioryear period 

the components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows 

gross profit 

our gross profit margin increased 23 percentage points due primarily to a combination of factors led by strong pricing discipline cost savings from our transformation programs a continued mix shift toward highermargin softwarerich offerings and favorable currency fluctuations 

operating expenses 

research and development 

rd expense increased by 105 million or 6 due primarily to higher employee compensation expense which contributed 110 percentage points to the change the increase was moderated by cost savings of 45 percentage points as we rationalize our rd through transformation programs by focusing investment in growth areas 

selling general and administrative 

sga expense increased b y 305 million or 7 due primarily to higher employee compensation expense and unfavorable currency fluctuations which contributed 41 percentage points and 21 percentage points to the change respectively 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization expense decreased by 25 million or 7 due to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization in the current period and higher writeoffs of certain intangible assets in the prioryear period the decrease was moderated by an increase in amortizations in the current period resulting from recent acquisitions 

impairment of goodwill 

impairment of goodwill for fiscal 2020 represents a partial goodwill impairment charge of 865 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as it was determined that the fair value of the hpc  ai reporting unit was below the carrying value of its net assets 

transformation programs and costs 

our transformation programs consist of the cost optimization and prioritization plan launched in 2020 and hpe next initiative launched in 2017 the cost optimization and prioritization plan focuses on realigning our workforce to areas of growth a new hybrid workforce model called edgetooffice real estate strategies and simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy the implementation period for the cost optimization and prioritization plan is through fiscal 2023 the hpe next initiative was intended to put in place a purposebuilt company designed to compete and win in the markets where we 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

participate by simplifying our operating model streamlining our offerings business processes and business systems to improve our execution the implementation period for hpe next was extended to fiscal 2023 

transformation costs decreased by 20 million or 2 due primarily to lower restructuring charges recorded in the current year with higher it costs and lower gains on real estate sales in the current period moderating the decrease 

disaster charges 

in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 disaster charges represent direct costs resulting from the pandemic and are primarily related to hpe hosted cohosted or sponsored events which were converted to a virtual format or cancelled 

acquisition disposition and other related charges 

acquisition disposition and other related charges decreased by  44 million due primarily to lower business acquisition costs related to retention bonuses and integration activities in the current year period 

interest and other net 

interest and other net expense was relatively unchanged from period to period due to offsetting factors with the current period including higher gains from equity investments lower interest expense from lower average borrowings and lower unfavorable currency fluctuations offset by early debt redemption costs lower gains on the sale of certain assets and lower interest income 

tax indemnification and related adjustments 

we record changes in certain preseparation tax liabilities for which we share joint and several liability with hp inc and for which we were indemnified under the termination and mutual release agreement within tax indemnification and related adjustments we also record changes to certain preseparation and predivestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business but which may not be subject to indemnification 

we recorded tax indemnification and related adjustments income of 65 million and expense of 101 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively 

tax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2021 primarily included the impacts of a brazilian supreme court decision received regarding the base on which two social contribution taxes in brazil pis and cofins are imposed as a result of this decision the company is entitled to recover credits and associated interest related to the overpayment of these transaction taxes imposed between 2005 and 2019 to be used to offset future brazilian tax liabilities as such we have recorded benefits of 17 million and 80 million both net of taxes for the recovery of pis and cofins respectively during fiscal 2021 of which 25 million was included in net revenue 10 million related to interest income was included in interest and other net and 80 million related to preseparation liabilities was included in tax indemnification and related adjustments the corresponding income taxes of 18 million as a result of this recovery were included in provision benefit for taxes in the consolidated statement of earnings 

tax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2020 resulted from changes in certain preseparation tax liabilities for which we shared joint and several liability with hp inc and for which we are indemnified under the termination and mutual release agreement and changes to certain predivestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables 

nonservice net periodic benefit credit 

nonservice net periodic benefit credit represents the components of net periodic pension benefit costs other than service cost for the hewlett packard enterprise defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans such as interest cost expected return on plan assets and the amortization of prior plan amendments and actuarial gains or losses the credit also includes the impact of any plan settlements curtailments or special termination benefits 

nonservice net periodic benefit credit decreased by 66 million due primarily to lower expected returns on plan assets 

litigation judgment 

in october 2021 the company received 235 billion which represents oracle corporations satisfaction of the judgment in the itanium breach of contract dispute the gain was recognized as other income and presented as a litigation judgment in

the consolidated statements of earnings for further discussion refer to note 17 “litigation and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference 

earnings from equity interests 

earnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49 interest in h3c technologies and the amortization of our interest in a basis difference earnings from equity interests increased by 113 million due to higher net income earned by h3c and gains from certain venture investments 

provision benefit for taxes 

for fiscal 2021 and 2020 we recorded income tax expense of 160 million and an income tax benefit of 120 million respectively which reflect effective tax rates of 45 and 271 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include puerto rico and singapore 

in fiscal 2021 we recorded 294 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year these amounts primarily included 

• 180 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition disposition and other related charges 

• 157 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances 

• 39 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes 

• 32 million of income tax benefits related to the change in preseparation tax liabilities primarily those for which we share joint and several liability with hp inc and for which we are indemnified by hp inc 

• these benefits were partially offset by 337 million of net income tax charges associated with income from the itanium litigation judgment against which 244 million of income tax attributes previously subject to a valuation allowance were utilized resulting in a net tax expense of 93 million 

in fiscal 2020 we recorded 362 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year these amounts primarily included 

• 174 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition disposition and other related charges

compute 



fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 

compute net revenue increased by 7 million or 01 decreased 20 on a constant currency basis due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations and an increase in average unit prices the net revenue increase was partially offset by a decrease in unit shipments resulting from material constraints due to a challenging supply chain environment as a result we ended the period with a significantly higher level of order backlog 

from a product perspective compute experienced revenue growth in the rack and synergy server product categories partially moderated by a revenue decline due to certain products approaching their endoflife services net revenue was relatively unchanged from period to period 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

compute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 26 percentage points due to decreases in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the decrease in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations lower supply chain overhead costs from operational efficiencies and disciplined pricing the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to cost savings from our transformation programs partially offset by higher employee compensation expense 

fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 

compute net revenue decreased by 14 billion or 105 decreased 94 on a constant currency basis due to the impact of the pandemic on the demand environment as we experienced multiple factors including competitive pricing pressures manufacturing capacity constraints in north america in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and unfavorable currency fluctuations as a result compute experienced a decline in unit shipments and average unit selling prices 

compute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 43 percentage points due primarily to an increase in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to competitive pricing pressures unfavorable currency fluctuations higher supply chain costs and the scale of the net revenue decline partially offset by lower commodity costs and a favorable mix the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to the scale of the net revenue decline as total operating expenses declined due primarily to lower spending resulting from our cost containment measures and lower variable compensation expense partially offset by higher field selling costs 

hpc  ai 





fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 

hpc  ai net revenue increased by 83 million or 27 increased 18 on a constant currency basis as the challenges encountered in the prior year period resulting from the pandemic receded such as delays with meeting customer milestones and the demand environment improved this resulted in net revenue growth in the apollo and cray product categories within hpc and growth in edge compute favorable currency fluctuations also added to the net revenue increase these increases were moderated by revenue declines in data solutions and services due to certain products approaching their endoflife and lower support services respectively

financing volume which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services including intercompany activity increased by 27 in fiscal 2021 and decreased 31 in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prioryear periods the increase in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by favorable currency fluctuations along with higher financing associated with thirdparty product sales and related service offerings the decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily related to lower financing associated with both thirdparty and hpe product sales and related service offerings along with unfavorable currency fluctuations 

portfolio assets and ratios 

the fs business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system the accounting policies used to derive fs amounts are substantially the same as those used by the company however intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

current overview 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures product development initiatives acquisition and disposal activities including legal settlements restructuring activities transformation costs indemnifications maturing debt interest payments and income tax payments in addition to any future investments share repurchases and stockholder dividend payments we expect to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary by accessing the capital markets issuing commercial paper and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions however our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions we anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations along with our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months we continue to monitor the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the us and other global economies the capital markets consumer behavior our businesses results of operations financial condition and cash flows our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a each of which is incorporated herein by reference

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with a substantial amount held outside the us as of october 31 2021 we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed 

amounts held outside of the us are generally utilized to support our nonus liquidity needs repatriations of amounts held outside the us generally will not be taxable from a us federal tax perspective but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the us and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of increased uncertainty due to the pandemic purchases under our share repurchase program previously authorized by our board of directors were temporarily suspended in april 2020 we resumed our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and settled 213 million of our stock as of october 31 2021 we had a remaining authorization of 19 billion for future share repurchases for more information on our share repurchase program refer to note 15 stockholders equity to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 36 billion for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the increase was due primarily to higher earnings which includes a 22 billion litigation judgment 

our key working capital metrics were as follows

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers early or late invoice payments from customers or to suppliers the extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends the timing of sales and inventory purchases within the period the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity 

dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal 2021 as compared to the prioryear period dso increased due primarily to a decrease in early payments and factoring extended payments terms and unfavorable billing linearity 

dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2021 as compared to the prioryear period the dos increased due primarily to higher levels of inventory resulting from a combination of supply chain constraints positioning of inventory to fulfill planned future shipments and strategic purchases of certain key components 

dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2021 as compared to the prioryear period dpo increased due primarily to higher inventory purchases for planned future shipments and extended payment terms 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased by 02 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the change was primarily due to higher cash utilized for investment in property plant and equipment net of sales proceeds of 05 billion and higher cash utilized in net financial collateral activities of 01 billion partially offset by lower payments made in connection with business acquisitions net of 04 billion 

financing activities 

net cash generated in financing activities decreased by 42 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the decrease was due primarily to lower proceeds from debt issuance of 40 billion higher cash utilized for debt repayment of 04 billion and lower cash utilized for share repurchase of 01 billion 

free cash flow 



free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less investments in property plant and equipment net of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in fiscal 2021 free cash flow does not include 22 billion of aftertax cash impact from oracle’s satisfaction of the judgment in the itanium litigation free cash flow increased by 10 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the increase was due to higher cash generated from operations and improved net working capital moderated by increased cash used for investments in property plant and equipment net of sales proceeds 

our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position help to ensure we have ample liquidity to run operations continuing to invest in our business to drive growth and return capital to shareholders

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis nongaap gross profit nongaap gross profit margin nongaap operating profit margin nongaap earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue nongaap net earnings nongaap diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow these nongaap financial measures are used by management for purposes of evaluating our historical and prospective financial performance as well as evaluating our performance relative to our competitors these nongaap financial measures are not computed in accordance with or as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the gaap measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap gross profit is gross profit the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap gross profit margin is gross profit margin the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap earnings from operations is earnings from operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap operating profit margin nongaap earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue is operating profit margin earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap net earnings is net earnings the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share the gaap measure most directly comparable to cash flow from operations and free cash flow each excluding litigation judgment net of taxes paid is cash flow from operations 

net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prioryear period nongaap gross profit and nongaap gross profit margin is defined to exclude charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs stockbased compensation expense and certain acquisition disposition and other related charges nongaap earnings from operations and nongaap operating profit margin nongaap earnings from operations as a percentage of net

revenue consist of earnings from operations excluding any charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill transformation costs disaster charges stockbased compensation expense and acquisition disposition and other related charges nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges as well as items such as tax indemnification and related adjustments nonservice net periodic benefit credit litigation judgment early debt redemption costs earnings from equity interests certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes the impact of us tax reform structural rate adjustment and excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation in addition nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each nongaap item we believe that excluding the items mentioned above from these nongaap financial measures allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of our segments management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results and excluding them facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance in comparison to our peers the excluded items can be inconsistent in amount and frequency andor not reflective of the operational performance of the business 

these nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of the limitations in relying on these nongaap financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent gaap earnings measures they may be calculated differently by other companies and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets 

we compensate for these limitations on the use of nongaap financial measures by relying primarily on our gaap results and using nongaap financial measures only as a supplement we also provide a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure we believe that providing net revenue on a constant currency basis nongaap gross profit nongaap gross profit margin nongaap earnings from operations nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted net earnings per share in addition to the related gaap measures provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows the reader of our consolidated financial statements to see our financial results “through the eyes” of management 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 50 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2021 were the euro japanese yen british pound and chinese yuan renminbi for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and from time to time options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales operating expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2021 and 2020 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2021 and 2020 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 35 million and 29 million at october 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued our investment portfolio and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing 

we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar based floating or fixed interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however in circumstances where we believe additional fixedrate debt would be beneficial we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap or swap certain floating interest payments to fixed 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of interest income received on certain variablerate investments by entering into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2021 and 2020 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2021 and 2020 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our 

debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 58 million and 47 million at october 31 2021 and 2020 respectively

our strengths 

we believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors including 

• digital transformation is at the forefront of our business priorities we have a distinctive and industry leading portfolio of edgetocloud solutions and unique capabilities to help accelerate our customers digital transformation we combine our softwaredefined infrastructure and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise solutions in the it industry our ability to deliver a comprehensive it strategy and connect our customers data from edge to cloud through our highquality products and highvalue consulting and support services in a single package is one of our principal differentiators 

• differentiated consumptionbased it solutions for a growing opportunity enterprises of all sizes are looking to digitally transform in order to develop nextgeneration cloudnative applications create actionable insights from their data and drive business growth but they face many challenges including lack of inhouse it skills limited budgets and options for financing and lack of flexibility to choose the technology foundation that best meets their needs 

consumptionbased it offers solutions to these challenges by providing greater agility empowering people to shift from managing infrastructure to driving innovation by leveraging insights from their data while eliminating capital and operating expenses tied to infrastructure overprovisioning hpe is distinctly differentiated in delivering a true consumptionbased it experience we saw the opportunity early and that has allowed us to build capabilities and partnerships that are unique in the industry including the ability to deliver our asaservice portfolio with over 700 channel partners that can sell the asaservice portfolio 

• multiyear innovation roadmap and strong balance sheet we have been in the technology and innovation business for over 75 years our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the expanding amount of data available and leverage the latest technology developments like cloud artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to drive business outcomes now and in the future we also have a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile that provides the financial flexibility and speed to take advantage of acquisition opportunities 

• global distribution and partner ecosystem we are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions to our customers in complex multicountry multivendor andor multilanguage environments we have one of the largest gotomarket capabilities in our industry including a large ecosystem of channel partners which enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world 

• custom financial solutions through financial services we can help customers create investment capacity to accelerate their transformations by helping them free up capital capture value from older assets achieve sustainability goals invest in new technologies as a service and weather financial volatility financial services is also an enabler of our consumptionbased it models by helping spread our upfront solution costs over the duration of the customer contract through financial services global asset recovery centers we are helping customers achieve their own sustainability goals by processing more than 4 million assets every year 

• experienced leadership team and business group leaders aligned to market trends and financial segmentation our management team has an extensive track record of performance and execution we are led by our president and chief executive officer antonio neri who has proven experience in developing transformative business models building global brands and driving sustained growth and expansion in the technology industry mr neris experience includes over 20 years combined at hpe and hp co in various leadership positions this year we simplified our operating model and have aligned it to the financial segmentation providing more visibility and accountability in our business segments our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of and experience in the enterprise it business and the markets in which we compete moreover we have a deep bench of management and technology talent that we believe provides us with an unparalleled pipeline of future leaders and innovators 

• open platforms the world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a future of centers of data everywhere which are highly decentralized and distributed this shift demands a common cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to the customers data sources to create realtime insights everywhere many of our competitors want to lock customers into one flavor of cloud and cloud stack conversely we believe that the cloud experience should be open and seamless across all our customers clouds — and the best cloud transformation partner is one who is unbiased offers choice and is neutral without an agenda we are unique in our ability to enable any hybrid cloud strategy and a consistent experience that is open to any cloud and differentiated with our partner integrations 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups including business and public sector enterprises and purchases of our products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

• resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups 

• distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers 

• original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products and services with their own products and services and sell the integrated solution 

• independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products 

• systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and 

• advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services 

the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses for example through our hpe next initiative we reduced the number of countries in which we have a direct sales presence while simultaneously migrating to a channelonly model in the remaining countries in those countries where we have a direct sales presence we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers as well as with large public sector accounts the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smaller accounts both in the commercial and public sector space 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design the use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand in addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

historically we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on singlesource suppliers for certain customized parts although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption and a disruption or loss of a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products in some instances our singlesource suppliers eg intel and amd as suppliers of certain x86 processors are also the singlesource suppliers for the entire market disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are geographically concentrated when necessary we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we may also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers relationships properly in item 1a 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products 

a summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in note 3 segment information to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii approximately 66 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2020 came from outside the united states 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and —we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a of part ii and note 14 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success our research and development efforts rd are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

expenditures for rd were 19 billion in fiscal 2020 18 billion in fiscal 2019 and 17 billion in fiscal 2018 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products services and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position 

included in the rd work currently taking place at the company are the following initiatives 

in compute we are developing high quality nextgeneration compute solutions servers server attached options and software that integrate the latest industry technology which coupled with innovations from hpe are aligned to the requirements of our customers 

in hpc  mcs we are investing in highperformance compute storage and networking systems for the most demanding workloads from the edgetocore investment in technologies in highperformance networking memorydriven compute and highperformance storage and data management underpin our differentiated offerings we also invest significantly in software including cloud native developer and highly scalable cluster operating environments application and performance capabilities and highavailability solutions hpc  mcs also hosts an applied research group where we invest in long term disruptive rd such as silicon photonics creating a pipeline of technologies for future offerings 

in the storage data management sphere we are investing in new technologies to address the demand in mature and emerging markets our comprehensive onpremises scalable infrastructure that includes an industryfirst 100 guarantee offering is being creatively augmented by an allinclusive asaservice hpe greenlake offering the company continues to empower the edgetocore data pipeline with embedded ai builttoscale and to provide deep learning analytics across its entirety 

in intelligent edge we are shifting significant investment towards a cloud first innovation model for the comprehensive management of wireless switching and software defined branch sdbranch with the cloud native edge services platform esp another key investment priority is artificial intelligence based network operations for the endtoend optimization of network performance and user experience combined with securing the network edge infrastructure by segmenting the internetofthings iot user traffic with dynamic context based policies 

in hewlett packard labs we are focused on disruptive innovation and applied research in collaboration with other hpe business groups to deliver differentiated intellectual property ip our innovation agenda is focused on developing technologies in the areas of system architecture networking ai accelerators and silicon photonics we also continue to invest in our silicon design capability to accelerate the development and delivery of our technology with custom integrated circuits 

for a discussion of risks attendant to our rd activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer in item 1a 

patents 

our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position as of october 31 2020 our worldwide patent portfolio included approximate ly 15000 issued and pending patents 

patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research 

and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend and —our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties in item 1a 

backlog 

in fiscal 2020 the outbreak of covid19 resulted in a disruption to our supply chain process the outbreak resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity including worldwide travel restrictions prohibitions of nonessential work activities disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets these events introduced a disruption to our supply chain at the beginning of the calendar year resulting in significantly higher levels of backlog particularly in compute hpc  mcs and storage as lockdown restrictions imposed across the globe disrupted our order fulfillment process and limited our ability to perform onsite installations and meet customer acceptance requirements subsequently by the latter part of the fiscal period we made significant progress in clearing our backlog such that we exited the fiscal year with normalized backlog levels 

during the covid19 pandemic we have also viewed backlog as an indication of demand health as governments around the world continue to impose restrictions on nonessential work activities and travel as and when the covid19 pandemic subsides our focus on backlog may again become less relevant as a reliable indicator of future demand 

for a further discussion of the risks uncertainties and actions taken in response to covid19 see risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a and the covid19 update in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer mont hs however the impact of the covid19 outbreak may result in temporary changes to the seasonal fluctuation of our business see risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a 

competition 

we have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise it infrastructure products solutions and services we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business we compete primarily on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our it infrastructure offerings 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are relatively short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services continuously enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above among others in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

the compute and storage businesses operate in the highly competitive enterprise data center infrastructure market which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition our primary competitors are technology vendors such as dell technologies inc cisco systems inc lenovo group ltd international business machines corporation and netapp inc in certain regions we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or whitebox manufacturers our strategy is to deliver superior products highvalue technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure software and services capabilities our competitive advantages include our broad endtoend solutions portfolio supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments see risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance in item 1a 

material government regulations 

our business activities are worldwide and are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are presently not material to our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations nonetheless as discussed below we believe that environmental and global trade regulations could potentially materially impact our business 

environment 

our products and operations are or may in the future be subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment including among others laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management movement and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 

product safety such as chemical composition packaging and labeling energy consumption of our products and services and the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including servers and networking equipment financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation finally as climate change laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

global trade 

as a global company the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties us export controls and sanctions laws customs regulations and local trade rules around the world such laws rules and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals or the need to comply with domestic preference programs laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code unique technical standards localization mandates and duplicative incountry testing and inspection requirements the consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally we continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated crossborder supply chains that will continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating hewlett packard enterprise and its common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k 

business and operational risks 

we are unable to predict the extent to which the global covid19 pandemic may adversely impact our business operations financial performance and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services worldwide including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations the pandemic has resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity including travel restrictions prohibitions of nonessential activities in some cases disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control including the various restrictions imposed by cities counties states and countries on our employees customers partners and suppliers designed to limit the spread of covid19 although the immediate impacts of the covid19 pandemic have been assessed the longterm magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity is still highly uncertain and cannot currently be predicted 

in response to the covid19 pandemic and to ensure the safety of our employees we have implemented a global workfromhome policy until further notice that applies to a significant majority of our employees with the exception of those performing essential activities our employees may elect to return to the office in jurisdictions where both local requirements and our own health and safety standards have been met if such instances occur employees would return to the office in a phased process moreover certain industry and customer events that we sponsor or at which we present have been canceled postponed or moved to virtualonly experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter postpone or cancel entirely additional events in the future we are also seeing an increase in customer requirements for hpe employees to be tested for covid19 before being able to enter customer sites which could potentially present an operational challenge however workfromhome and other modified business practices introduce additional operational risks including cybersecurity risks which may result in inefficiencies or delays and have affected the way we conduct our product development sales customer support and other activities unanticipated disruptions in services provided through our localized physical infrastructure caused by the covid19 pandemic can curtail the functioning of critical components of our it systems and adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders provide services respond to customer requests and maintain our worldwide business operations 

the pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business by negatively impacting the demand for our products and services restricting our operations and sales marketing and distribution efforts disrupting the supply chains of hardware products and disrupting our research and development capabilities engineering design and manufacturing processes and other important business activities for example we expect the conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic could affect the rate of it spending impact our customers ability or willingness to purchase our products and services delay prospective customers purchasing decisions delay the provisioning of our products and services lengthen payment terms reduce the value or duration of subscription contracts or affect attrition rates all of which could adversely affect our sales operating results and financial performance there have been and likely will continue to be delays of components shipments from our vendors in china and other jurisdictions in which normal business operations are disrupted 

we expect the covid19 pandemic could continue to have a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict while such changes were factored into the forecast used to assess assets for reserves and impairment including goodwill and to calculate the annualized effective tax rate during the interim quarters of fiscal 2020 any changes to the profitability for the next fiscal year could impact the realizability of assets and the annualized effective tax rate applied to earnings additionally concerns over the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price our ability to access capital markets and our ability to fund liquidity needs in response we announced our longterm cost optimization and prioritization plan to focus our investments and realign our workforce to areas of growth combined with shortterm cost saving measures including temporary base salary adjustments or unpaid leave for certain employees and hiring and salary freezes execution of the plan may not achieve the results and savings we anticipate and our temporary cost saving measures may negatively affect employee morale and our future recruiting efforts 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this risk factors section and those incorporated by reference herein such as 

those related to our products and services demand and distribution financial performance credit rating and debt obligations given that developments concerning the covid19 pandemic have been constantly evolving additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to appropriately respond to at this time 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations and supply chain could be disrupted by natural or human induced disasters including but not limited to earthquakes tsunamis floods hurricanes cyclones or typhoons fires other extreme weather conditions power or water shortages telecommunications failures materials scarcity and price volatility terrorist acts conflicts or wars and medical epidemics or pandemics we are predominantly selfinsured to mitigate the impact of most catastrophic events although it is impossible to completely predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events forecasting disruptive events and building additional resiliency into our operations accordingly will become an increasing business imperative the occurrence of business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations 

climate change serves as a risk multiplier increasing both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california which suffers from drought conditions and catastrophic wildfires affecting the health and safety of our employees to mitigate wildfire risk electric utilities are deploying public safety power shutoffs psps which affects electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in 2017 our principal worldwide it data centers in houston were flooded due hurricane harvey since then hpe has increased its resiliency through site selection infrastructure technological investments to mitigate and adapt to physical risks from climate change 

the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including the united states czech republic mexico china and singapore we also rely on major logistics hubs which are strategically located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to hpes distribution channels and customers our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near vulnerable locations is continuing to be assessed 

us trade policy including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

given the change in the us presidential administration we face uncertainty with regard to us government trade policy current us government trade policy includes the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign goods including information and communication technology products these measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices result in lowering our margin on products sold us government trade policy has resulted in and could result in more us trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries 

our transition to a subscriptionbased business model may adversely affect our business operating results and free cash flow 

we are currently transitioning to an asaservice company providing our entire portfolio through a range of subscriptionbased payperuse and asaservice offerings we will also continue to provide our hardware and software in a capital expenditure and licensebased model ultimately giving our customers choice in consuming hpe products and services in a traditional or asaservice offering such business model changes entail significant risks and uncertainties and we may be unable to complete the transition to a subscriptionbased business model or manage the transition successfully and in a timely manner and our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results may be adversely affected additionally we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the subscription transition even if we successfully complete the transition the transition to a subscriptionbased business model also means that our historical results especially those achieved before we began the transition may not be indicative of our future results further as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings for which revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery and our asaservice offerings for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 

in addition the transition to an asaservice company is expected to require incremental capital requirements resulting in a negative impact to cash flows in the near term and may require us to dedicate additional resources including sales and marketing costs furthermore we anticipate needing to redesign our gotomarket structure to better align with the subscriptionbased business model there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these adjustments in a timely or costeffective manner or that we will be able to realize all or any of the expected benefits from such adjustments 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of solutions that we offer the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain solutions problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply and contractual relational and labor risks each of which is described below 

• component shortages we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also our customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays 

• excess supply in order to secure components for our products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

• contractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

• contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws 

• singlesource suppliers we obtain certain components from singlesource suppliers due to technology availability price quality scale or customization needs replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may initially be unable to meet demand or be subject to other output limitations for some components such as customized components alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of a singlesource supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a singlesource supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a singlesource supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our periodic restructuring programs can be disruptive to our business 

we have announced restructuring plans including the hpe next initiative and the cost optimization and prioritization plan in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs as well as simplify our organizational structure upgrade our it infrastructure and redesign business processes we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans the hpe next initiative and the cost optimization and prioritization plan see note 4 transformation programs to the consolidated financial statements 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our strategy we may acquire businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions and handle any postclosing issues such as integration for example in september 2020 we acquired silver peak systems inc an sdwan industry leader and in september 2019 we acquired cray inc a global supercomputer leader in april 2017 and september 2017 we spun off our enterprise services and software businesses respectively see also the risk factors below under the heading risks related to the separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment 

risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our financial results including our effective tax rate 

• we may not successfully combine product or service offerings or fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction which may result in 1 failure to retain employees customers distributors and suppliers 2 increase in unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations which may cause financial results to differ from expectations and 3 significant increase in costs and expenses including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans 

• our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives we may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired companys product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters 

• in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders or we may enter into financing arrangements which could affect our liquidity and financial condition 

• business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation which could impact our financial condition and results of operations 

• we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

• for a divestiture we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated 

• the impact of divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected as we may experience greater dissynergies than expected if we do not satisfy preclosing conditions and necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms it may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

• our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult or discourage an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise if our board of directors deems it to be undesirable provisions such as indemnification meeting 

requirements and blank check stock authorizations could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests or changes in control or management of hewlett packard enterprise 

managements attention or other resources may be diverted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or it services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

as a leading technology firm we are exposed to attacks from criminals nation state actors and activist hackers collectively malicious parties who may be able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures and misappropriate maliciously alter or destroy our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain to embed malicious software or hardware in our products for use in compromising our customers in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our business may process store and transmit our clients data including commercially sensitive and personal data subject to the european general data protection regulation and other privacy laws breaches of our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information sensitive or confidential data or personal data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss including regulatory fines or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we deliver global edge to cloud platformasaservice to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from all of their data everywhere hpe delivers unique open and intelligent technology solutions with a consistent experience across all clouds and edge computing platforms to successfully execute this strategy we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by improving cost structure aligning sales coverage with strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual 

property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer  

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement moreover some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and 

otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened 

our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

industry risks 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution product range and ease of use account relationships customer training service and support and security of our offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have vertical relationships in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have vertical relationships also may acquire or form relationships with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with vertical partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products and services we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards software defined and public cloud which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products 

international risks 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates and costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses further ongoing us federal government spending priorities may limit demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions 

sales outside the united states constituted approximately 66 of our net revenue in fiscal 2020 our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic 

• longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers 

• trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors us export controls and sanctions and federal and state tax reforms 

• local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and original equipment manufacturers oems or changes to immigration and labor law policies which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent 

• managing our geographically dispersed workforce 

• changes in the international national or local regulatory and legal environments 

• differing technology standards or customer requirements 

• import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions 

• difficulties associated with repatriating earnings in restricted countries and changes in tax laws and 

• fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments 

the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies people may engage in business practices prohibited by anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees and third parties we work with may take actions in violation of our policies and those actions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

intellectual property risks 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties for example many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement including patent infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights patent assertion entities frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of extracting infringement settlements if we cannot license or replace allegedly infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products discontinue certain product offerings enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from 

importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

financial risks 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service standard  poors ratings services and fitch ratings services despite these investment grade credit ratings any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts additionally increased borrowing costs including those arising from a credit rating downgrade can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

in addition to our current total carrying debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future this collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors including 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments 

• making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations 

• increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry and 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock 

to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks described above could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to service or refinance our debt 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability variations in fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in addition newer geographic market opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our businesses our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings 

cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition as discussed in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies—use of estimates and note 17 litigation and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

regulatory risks 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations such as those concerning environmental protection for example we face increasing complexity related to product design the use of regulated hazardous and scarce materials the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to the use of products the transportation and shipping of products climate change regulations and the reuse recycling andor disposal of products and their components at endofuse or useful life as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our transition to a more circular economy if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws or market access requirements our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions fines andor civil or criminal sanctions environmental regulations may also impact the availability and cost of energy or emissions related to energy consumption which may increase our cost of manufacturing andor the cost of powering and cooling owned it infrastructures 

in addition our business is subject to an ever growing number of laws addressing privacy and information security in particular we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings if we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy or security we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions our potential exposure includes regulatory fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims and reputational damage 

failure to comply with government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new government contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges cross 

jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association of 34 countries including the united states has proposed changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these proposals if finalized and adopted by the associated countries will likely increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

presidentelect biden has provided some informal guidance on what tax law changes he would support among other things his proposals would raise the rate on both domestic and foreign income and impose a new alternative minimum tax on book income if these proposals are ultimately enacted into legislation they could materially impact our tax provision cash tax liability and effective tax rate 

during fiscal 2019 we executed a termination and mutual release agreement which terminated our tax matters agreement with hp inc because we now have limited indemnity rights from hp inc we potentially bear more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments 

risks related to prior separations 

the stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment could result in significant tax liability and dxc or micro focus as applicable may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us 

the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our software segment were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of i the relevant distribution and related transactions as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 368a 361 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the code and ii the relevant merger as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code while the software separation generally qualified for taxfree treatment for us seattle spinco and micro focus the acquisition of seattle spinco by micro focus resulted in the recognition of gain but not loss for us persons who received micro focus american depositary shares in the software separation 

each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us everett spinco and csc or us seattle spinco and micro focus as applicable if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized notwithstanding the opinions of counsel the internal revenue service the irs could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position 

if the distribution of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who receive everett spinco shares or seattle spinco shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

we obtained private letter rulings from the irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation of our enterprise services business and software segment those rulings concluded that certain transactions in those separations are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the conclusions of the irs private letter rulings were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete the validity of the irs private letter rulings may be affected notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment including nonus tax expenses resulting from 

the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material if the completed separation of our former enterprise services business or software segment including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those separations are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor dxc andor micro focus could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

under the tax matters agreements entered into by us with everett spinco and csc and with seattle spinco and micro focus everett spinco and seattle spinco generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by or acquisitions of capital stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable any such indemnity obligations could be material 

we continue to face a number of risks related to the separation from our former parent including those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and shared use of certain intellectual property rights which could in the future adversely impact our reputation 

in connection with the separation hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc entered into several agreements that determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations in these agreements hp inc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify hp inc for certain liabilities including crossindemnities that are designed and intended to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of hp incs business with hp inc we may be obligated to fully indemnify hp inc for certain liabilities under the separation agreements or hp inc may not be able to fully cover their indemnification obligations to us under the same separation agreements each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the terms of the separation also include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively as a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hp inc could also adversely affect the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise 

general risks 

our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows our stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile and can be affected by among other things speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by us or our competitors our quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us the financial results and business strategies of our competitors developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes or the timing and amount of our share repurchases general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hewlett packard enterprises performance also may affect the price of hewlett packard enterprises stock volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources

trends and uncertainties 

covid19 

the outbreak of covid19 in 2020 resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity including worldwide travel restrictions prohibitions of nonessential work activities disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets covid19 continues to have an impact on our financial performance and we are currently unable to predict the extent to which covid19 may adversely impact our future business operations financial performance and results of operations the full extent of the impact of covid19 on the companys operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the companys control including without limitation the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines the imposition of protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for our enterprise technology solutions for a further discussion of the risks uncertainties and actions taken in response to covid19 see risks identified in the section entitled  risk factors in part i item 1a 

the company believes its existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities along with commercial paper and other shortterm liquidity arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs capital asset purchases dividends debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations 

the company also believes that covid19 has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities that are aligned with the companys edgetocloud platform delivered asaservice strategy navigating through the pandemic and planning for a postcovid world have increased customers needs for asaservice offerings secure connectivity remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data our solutions are aligned to these needs and we see opportunity to help our customers drive digital transformations as they continue to adapt to operate in a new world 

we have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our team members supporting the global communities in which we live and work and supporting our customers and partners to help them adjust to new and emerging needs 

in response to the covid19 pandemic and to ensure the safety of our employees we implemented a global workfromhome policy until further notice that applies to a significant majority of our employees with the exception of those performing essential activities in october 2020 in certain countries we introduced a new hybrid model of work to our workforce called edgetooffice depending on role classification work will now primarily be done at the edge outside of the office or at hpe sites hpe sites will be used for collaborations social connections and other work as needed for all roles the implementation of edgetooffice will occur in a phasedapproach across the company and as local regulations allow 

we have also made additional education and support resources and personal protective supplies available to team members in the event of a confirmed or probable case of covid19 among our team members and contractors we have implemented a confidential reporting process to trace and notify close contacts—including third parties—that maintains the anonymity of all involved 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we announced new returntowork solutions to help customers accelerate business recovery and reopening plans the solutions combine expertise from hpe operational services for a fast seamless transition with hpe servers for the edge aruba aipowered network infrastructure and technologies from hpes rich ecosystem of partners customers that have implemented these solutions include large international airports global food processing and packaging plants retail stores and corporate offices 

while we continue to mitigate the impact on our business and operations to address the nearterm uncertainty in fiscal 2020 we took a number of actions to ensure hpe is well positioned to emerge stronger more agile and digitally enabled for a postcovid19 world 

• on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act was enacted into law the cares act among other things provides tax relief to businesses including the deferral of certain payroll taxes relief for retaining employees and other income tax provisions in addition to the cares act governments around the world also enacted comparable legislation to address covid19 economic impacts based on the relief provided by this legislation in fiscal 2020 we deferred 92 million of payroll taxes which the company will pay at least partially or in full prior to the end of fiscal 2021 

• on april 6 2020 we announced that we suspended purchases under our share repurchase program

• in april 2020 we issued 225 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes to enhance our liquidity and strengthen our capital additionally in july 2020 we issued 175 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes the net proceeds from july offerings were used primarily for the redemption in august 2020 of the 30 billion outstanding principal amount of the 36 unsecured senior notes that were originally due in october 2020 

• on may 19 2020 the board of directors of hpe the board approved a cost optimization and prioritization plan we expect that this plan will be implemented through fiscal 2023 and estimate that it will include gross savings of at least 10 billion as a result of changes to our workforce business model and business process with this plan being expected to deliver annualized net runrate savings of at least 800 million by the end of fiscal 2023 in both cases relative to our fiscal 2019 exit in order to achieve this level of cost savings we estimate related cash funding payments of 13 billion over the next three years of which approximately 07 billion will relate to labor restructuring 05 billion will relate to nonlabor restructuring and 01 billion will relate to it investments and design and execution charges for further details of the plan see the other section of this discussion 

• on may 19 2020 the board approved cost containment measures including temporary base salary adjustments or unpaid leave for certain employees beginning july 1 2020 along with restrictions on external hiring and salary increases effective november 1 2020 the aforementioned cost containment measures were returned to their original levels prior to the change 

• during fiscal 2020 we paid a quarterly dividend of 012 per share to our shareholders on december 1 2020 we declared a quarterly dividend of 012 per share payable on or about january 6 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on december 9 2020 

other 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges include dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the market shift of workloads to cloudrelated it infrastructure business models emergence of softwaredefined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality and growth in it consumption models certain of our legacy hardware server and storage businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products therefore the demand environment for traditional server and storage products is challenging and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is impacting support attach opportunities within the associated services organization 

another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others 

a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution we intend to provide our customers with a choice between traditional consumption models or subscriptionbased payperuse and asaservice offerings across out entire portfolio of hpe products and services 

to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by successfully transitioning to our asaservice model further improving our cost structure aligning sales coverage with our strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus which includes accelerating growth in the intelligent edge and high performance compute businesses and delivering profitable growth across each of our business segments we need to continue to pursue new product innovation that builds on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking which will keep us aligned with market demand industry trends and the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies

the following transformation programs were launched in response to the aforementioned challenges 

cost optimization and prioritization plan 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we launched a cost optimization and prioritization plan which focuses on realigning our workforce to areas of growth including a new hybrid workforce model call edgetooffice real estate strategies and simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy the implementation period for the cost optimization and prioritization plan is through fiscal 2023 during this implementation period we expect to incur transformation costs predominantly related to labor restructuring nonlabor restructuring it investments and design and execution charges 

hpe next 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we launched an initiative called hpe next to put in place a purposebuilt company designed to compete and win in the markets where we participate through this program we are simplifying our operating model streamlining our offerings business processes and business systems to improve our execution the implementation period for hpe next is now extended to fiscal 2023 during the remaining implementation period we expect to incur transformation charges predominantly related to it transformation costs for streamlining upgrading and simplifying backend operations and real estate initiatives these costs will be partially offset by gains from real estate sales

1 hpe consolidated net revenue excludes intersegment net revenue 

2 segment earnings from operations exclude certain unallocated corporate costs and eliminations stockbased compensation expense related to corporate and certain global functions amortization of capitalized initial direct costs transformation costs amortization of intangible assets acquisition dispositions and other related charges impairment of goodwill and disaster recovery charges 

net revenue decreased by 22 billion or 74 decreased 64 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 

during fiscal 2020 we experienced a net revenue decline due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and the worldwide demand environment the impact of covid19 and resulting lockdown restrictions was felt across each of our business segments and included challenges such as disruptions to our supply chain process with processing order fulfillment due in part to related commodity constraints delays with meeting customer acceptance milestones and our ability to perform and complete onsite installations the pandemic and related restrictions also contributed to manufacturing capacity constraints during the first half of fiscal 2020 which along with the consolidation of certain locations in north america increased order backlog although we significantly improved our operational and supply chain execution in the second half of fiscal 2020 our financial results continued to be impacted by the weak worldwide demand environment resulting from the pandemic related restrictions given the comprehensive impact of the pandemic and to avoid repetition the following discussion of the financial performance of each segment in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 will focus on the other leading factors contributing to their performance 

from a segment perspective the net revenue decrease in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily led by declines in compute storage and financial services partially offset by a net revenue increase in hpc  mcs the net revenue decline in compute was due to competitive pricing pressures and manufacturing capacity constraints in north america storage net revenue was impacted by manufacturing capacity constraints in north america and lower revenue from the expiration of a onetime legacy contract financial services net revenue was impacted due to a decrease in rental revenue due to

lower average operating lease assets lower lease equipment buyout revenue and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations hpc  mcs experienced a net revenue increase due to the addition of revenue from the acquisition of cray inc cray 

our gross profit margin was 314 85 billion and 326 95 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively the 12 percentage point decrease to the gross profit margin was primarily driven by the combination of competitive pricing pressures higher supply chain costs resulting from the impact of covid19 unfavorable currency fluctuations and the scale of the net revenue decline partially offset by our overall shift to highermargin products and services along with lower variable compensation expense our operating profit margin was 12 and 44 for fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively representing a decrease of 56 percentage points the decrease was due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue coupled with a decrease in the gross profit margin the increase in operating expenses was due primarily to the goodwill impairment charge impacting our hpc  mcs segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and higher transformation costs partially offset by the prioryear period containing higher acquisition disposition and other related charges resulting from an arbitration settlement and cost containment measures 

as of october 31 2020 cash cash equivalents and restricted cash were 46 billion representing an increase of approximately 05 billion from the october 31 2019 balance of 41 billion the increase was due primarily to the following cash provided by operating activities of 22 billion net proceeds from debt issuance net of repayments of 19 billion partially offset by investments in property plant and equipment net of sales proceeds of 17 billion cash payments related to dividends and share repurchases of 10 billion and business acquisition activity of 09 billion

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis nongaap gross profit nongaap gross profit margin nongaap earnings from operations nongaap operating profit margin nongaap earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted net earnings per share these nongaap financial measures are used by management for purposes of evaluating our historical and prospective financial performance as well as evaluating our performance relative to our competitors these nongaap financial measures are not computed in accordance with or as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the gaap measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap gross profit is gross profit the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap gross profit margin is gross profit margin the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap earnings from operations is earnings from operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap operating profit margin nongaap earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue is operating profit margin earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap net earnings is net earnings the gaap measure most directly comparable to nongaap diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share 

net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prioryear period nongaap gross profit and nongaap gross profit margin is defined to exclude charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs and certain acquisition disposition and other related charges nongaap earnings from operations and nongaap operating profit margin nongaap earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue consist of earnings from operations excluding any charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill transformation costs disaster charges and acquisition disposition and other related charges nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges as well as an adjustment to tax indemnification adjustments nonservice net periodic benefit credit earnings from equity interests certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes the impact of us tax reform structural tax rate and excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation in addition nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each nongaap item we believe that excluding the items mentioned above from these nongaap financial measures allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of our segments management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results and excluding them facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance in comparison to our peers the excluded items can be inconsistent in amount and frequency andor not reflective of the operational performance of the business 

these nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of the limitations in relying on these nongaap financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent gaap earnings measures they may be calculated differently by other companies and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets 

we compensate for these limitations on the use of nongaap financial measures by relying primarily on our gaap results and using nongaap financial measures only as a supplement we also provide a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure we believe that providing net revenue on a constant currency basis nongaap gross profit nongaap gross profit margin nongaap earnings from operations nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted net earnings per share in addition to the related gaap measures provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows the reader of our consolidated financial statements to see our financial results through the eyes of management

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources including the economic considerations related to the impact that the novel coronavirus pandemic covid19 could have on our significant accounting estimates management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hpes board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

general 

we account for a contract with a customer when both parties have provided written approval and are committed to perform each partys rights including payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collection of consideration is probable 

we enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products andor various services we determine whether each product or service is distinct in order to identify the performance obligations in the contract and allocate the contract transaction price among the distinct performance obligations arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether the commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software licenses and softwareasaservice saas as distinct performance obligations term software licenses represent multiple obligations which include software licenses and software maintenance in transactions where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis 

the majority of our revenue is derived from sales of product and the associated support and maintenance which is recognized when or as control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services variable consideration offered in contracts with customers partners and distributors may include rebates volumebased discounts cooperative marketing price protection and other incentive programs variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available and recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur 

transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer transfer of control can also occur over time for maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided saas 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services on our product sales we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales revenue is recorded net of any associated sales taxes 

significant judgments 

we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis the standalone selling price ssp is the price at which an entity would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer we establish ssp for most of our products and services based on the observable price of the products or services when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers when the ssp is not directly observable we estimate ssp based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives pricing strategies marketcompetitive conditions historical profitability data as well as other observable inputs we establish ssp ranges for our products and services and reassesses them periodically 

judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration may include various rebates volumebased discounts cooperative marketing price protection and other incentive programs that are offered to customers partners and distributors when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these programs applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available we also consider the customers right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable 

restructuring 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the value of lease and contract cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 3 transformation programs to the consolidated financial statements 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 retirement and postretirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions of discount rates the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2020

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we will adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future sources of taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the us in addition future earnings from nonus operations will largely be subject to us tax therefore the indefinitely reinvested undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences represent amounts that are not expected to be subject to us tax in the foreseeable future 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 95 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our provision benefit for taxes net earnings loss and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest uncertain tax positions from acquired companies as well as preseparation state income tax liabilities of hp inc for which the company is jointly and severally liable for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 taxes on earnings to the consolidated financial statements 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments at each reporting period to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in future demand forecasts market conditions technological changes product lifecycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test we perform a quantitative test for each of our reporting units as part of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level as of october 31 2020 our reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 2 segment information to the consolidated financial statements 

in the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge 

estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions covering discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows risk adjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly traded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is impaired the goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

on march 31 2020 due to the macroeconomic impacts of covid19 on our current and projected future results of operations we determined that an indicator of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test for its reporting units 

based on the results of this interim quantitative impairment test the fair value of the hpc  mcs reporting unit was below the carrying value of net assets assigned to hpc  mcs the decline in the fair value of the hpc  mcs reporting unit 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

resulted from macroeconomic impacts of covid19 which lowered the projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels of the reporting unit the fair value of the hpc  mcs reporting unit was based on a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimated the fair value of hpc  mcs based on the present value of estimated future cash flows which we considered to be a level 3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy we prepared cash flow projections based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins that considered our historical performance and the current macroeconomic industry and market conditions we based the discount rate on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to hpc  mcss ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimated fair value based on market multiple earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as hpc  mcs we weighted the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to hpc  mcs 

prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test we tested the recoverability of longlived assets and other assets of the hpc  mcs reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired the quantitative goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the hpc  mcs reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 865 million as a result we recorded a partial goodwill impairment charge of 865 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 did not result in any additional impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 7 to 31 of the respective carrying amounts in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit based on the results of this hypothetical 10 decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount with the exception of hpc  mcs reporting unit 

as of the annual test date subsequent to the impairment recognized in march the hpc  mcs reporting unit has a goodwill of 36 billion and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 7 the fair value of the hpc  mcs reporting unit was based on the same methodology used for the interim test which was a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach our hpc  mcs business is facing challenges as a result of the macroeconomic impacts of covid19 on our current and projected future results if we are not successful in addressing these challenges our projected revenue growth rates or operating margins could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the hpc  mcs reporting unit the fair value of the hpc  mcs reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by changes in its weighted average cost of capital changes in managements business strategy or significant and sustained declines in our stock price which could result in an indicator of impairment 

in addition each of our reporting units has experienced a reduction of the excess of fair value over carrying value for the reporting unit primarily as a result of covid19 impacts on our current and projected future results should economic conditions deteriorate further or remain depressed for a prolonged period of time estimates of future cash flows for each of our reporting units may be insufficient to support the carrying value and the goodwill assigned to them requiring impairment charges including additional impairment charges for the hpc  mcs reporting unit further impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position see part ii item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the potential impacts of covid19 on the fair value of our assets 

intangible assets 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes at october 31 2020 the gross notional amount of our derivative portfolio was 201 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 510 million and 194 million respectively as of october 31 2020 

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves company and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 12 fair value and note 13 financial instruments respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters which arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in note 17 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2020 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and doesnt adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of a current year revenue converted to us dollars using the prioryear periods foreign currency exchange rates divided by b prioryear period revenue this information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows

net revenue 

the components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows 



fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 

in fiscal 2020 our total net revenue decreased by 215 billion or 74 decreased 64 on a constant currency basis us net revenue decreased by 042 billion or 44 to 92 billion while net revenue from outside of the us decreased by 173 billion or 89 to 178 billion 

during fiscal 2020 we experienced a net revenue decline due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and the worldwide demand environment given the comprehensive impact of the pandemic and to avoid repetition the following discussion of each segments financial performance in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 will focus on the other leading factors contributing to their performance from a segment perspective the primary factors contributing to the change in total net revenue are summarized as follows 

• compute net revenue decreased due primarily to competitive pricing pressures manufacturing capacity constraints in north america in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

• hpc  mcs net revenue increased due primarily to the addition of revenue resulting from the acquisition of cray 

• storage net revenue decreased due primarily to commodity and manufacturing capacity constraints in north america in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and lower revenue from the expiration of a onetime legacy contract  

• a  ps net revenue decreased due primarily to service delivery delays 

• intelligent edge net revenue decreased due primarily to competitive pricing pressures and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations resulting in lower revenue from wlan switching products and software offerings and 

• financial services net revenue decreased due primarily to a decrease in rental revenue due to lower average operating lease assets lower lease equipment buyout revenue and unfavorable currency fluctuations 

fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 

in fiscal 2019 our total net revenue decreased by 17 billion or 56 decreased 43 on a constant currency basis us net revenue decreased by 610 million or 60 to 96 billion while net revenue from outside of the us decreased by 11 billion or 54 to 195 billion 

from a segment perspective the primary factors contributing to the change in total net revenue are summarized as follows 

• compute net revenue decreased due primarily to lower tier 1 server sales and lower revenue from china as part of our strategic move to exit less profitable product categories and certain markets and unfavorable currency fluctuations 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

• hpc  mcs net revenue decreased due primarily to the combination of lower services revenue mcs and edge compute product revenue 

• storage net revenue increased due primarily to growth in hyperconverged storage products big data products and storage services 

• a  ps net revenue decreased due primarily to demand weakness our initiative to streamline our gotomarket approach in certain countries and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

• intelligent edge net revenue decreased due primarily to lower sales from switching and wlan products driven by sales execution issues particularly in the north america region weaker demand and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and 

• fs net revenue decreased due primarily to a decrease in rental revenue and unfavorable currency fluctuations 

gross profit 

fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 

our gross profit margin decreased 12 percentage points for fiscal 2020 as compared with fiscal 2019 the decreases in the gross profit margin were due to a combination of factors including competitive pricing pressures higher supply chain costs resulting from the impact of covid19 unfavorable currency fluctuations and the scale of the net revenue decline partially offset by our continued shift to higher margin products and services and lower variable compensation expense 

fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 

our gross profit margin increased 27 percentage points for fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018 the increase in gross profit margin was due primarily to a combination of factors including the yearoveryear decrease in commodity costs lower costs of services and products due to our cost management initiatives and a lower mix of revenue from lowermargin tier1 server sales coupled with a higher mix of revenue from highermargin products 

operating expenses 

research and development 

rd expense increased by 32 million or 2 in fisca l 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to ongoing expenses from business acquisitions partially offset by the impact of cost containment measures we put in place in response to covid19 

rd expense increased by 175 million or 10 in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to our continued investments in the intelligent edge and storage and ongoing expenses from recent business acquisitions partially offset by favorable currency fluctuations 

selling general and administrative 

sga expense decreased b y 283 million or 6 f or fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to the impact of cost containment measures we put in place in response to covid19 lower litigation expenses and favorable currency fluctuations partially offset by ongoing expenses from business acquisitions 

sga expense decreased by 14 million or 03 for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations and lower variable compensation expense partially offset by higher investments in the sales organization 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization expense increased by 112 million or 42 in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to an increase in the amortization of intangible assets from recent acquisitions and the writeoff of certain intangible assets partially offset by certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization period 

amortization expense decreased by 27 million or 9 in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods partially offset by an increase in the amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions

impairment of goodwill 

impairment of goodwill for fiscal 2020 represents a partial goodwill impairment charge of 865 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as it was determined that the fair value of the hpc  mcs reporting unit was below the carrying value of its net assets 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 management of the then hybrid it segment changed its evaluation of hybrid it to evaluate the previously integrated cms business separately from the remainder of hybrid it resulting in a reassessment of the reporting units this change in segment management review triggered an interim goodwill test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and based on that test the fair value of cms was lower than its carrying value leading to a goodwill impairment charge of 88 million in fiscal 2018 

transformation costs 

transformation programs are comprised of the cost optimization and prioritization plan which we introduced in may 2020 and the hpe next initiative 

transformation costs increased by 497 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to restructuring charges recorded in the current period in connection with the cost optimization and prioritization plan and increased restructuring costs from the hpe next initiative these increases were partially offset by higher gains in the current period from the sale of real estate 

transformation costs increased by 39 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to fiscal 2019 containing the combination of lower gains from the sale of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets the effects of which were partially offset primarily by lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2019 

disaster charges recovery 

in fiscal 2020 disaster charges represent direct costs resulting from covid19 and are primarily related to hpe hosted cohosted or sponsored events which were converted to a virtual format or in some cases cancelled 

in fiscal 2019 disaster recovery amounts represent insurance recoveries in relation to damage to our facilities in houston texas due to hurricane harvey in fiscal 2017 

acquisition disposition and other related charges 

acquisition disposition and other related charges decreased by 677 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to a charge related to a onetime arbitration settlement in the prioryear period partially offset by recent business acquisition costs related to retention bonuses and integration activities 

acquisition disposition and other related charges increased by 675 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to a charge related to a onetime arbitration settlement 

interest and other net 

interest and other net expense increased by 38 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations and higher net interest expense partially offset by a higher gain from the sale of certain assets in the current year 

interest and other net expense decreased by 97 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to the combination of gains from equity investments and favorable currency fluctuations 

tax indemnification adjustments 

tax indemnification adjustments representin g 101 million of expense 377 million of income and 14 billion of expense in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively resulted primarily from the settlement of certain preseparation tax liabilities for which we share joint and several liability with hp inc and for which we were partially indemnified by hp inc under the terminated tax matters agreement additionally fiscal 2019 also includes the impact of the termination of the tax matters agreement with hp inc in limited circumstances we continue to be indemnified under the termination and mutual release agreement which terminated the tax matters agreement

nonservice net periodic benefit credit 

nonservice net periodic benefit credit represents the components of net periodic pension benefit costs other than service cost for the hewlett packard enterprise defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans such as interest cost expected return on plan assets and the amortization of prior plan amendments and actuarial gains or losses the credit also includes the impact of any plan settlements curtailments or special termination benefits 

nonservice net periodic benefit credit increased by 77 million i n fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to lower interest rates 

nonservice net periodic benefit credit decreased by 62 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to lower expected returns on pension investments 

earnings from equity interests 

earnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49 interest in h3c and the amortization of a basis difference earnings from equity interests increased by 47 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to higher net income earned by h3c 

earnings from equity interests decreased by 18 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due to lower net income earned by h3c 

provision for taxes 

our effective tax rates were 271 325 and 6507 in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include puerto rico and singapore 

in fiscal 2020 we recorded 362 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year these amounts primarily included 174 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition disposition and other related charges 66 million of income tax benefits related to the change in preseparation tax liabilities primarily those for which we share joint and several liability with hp inc and for which we are indemnified by hp inc 57 million of income tax benefits related to indian distribution tax rate changes and 40 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes these discrete tax benefits were offset by 242 million of net income tax charges related to normal operations and the impact of the companys goodwill impairment charge being nondeductible from a tax perspective 

in fiscal 2019 we recorded 152 million of net income tax charges related to items discrete to the year these amounts primarily included 488 million of income tax charges related to changes in us federal and state valuation allowances primarily as a result of impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act and 40 million of income tax charges related to future withholding costs on potential intercompany distributions of earnings the effects of which were partially offset by 274 million of income tax benefits related to the change in preseparation tax liabilities for which we shared joint and several liability with hp inc and 104 million of income tax benefits on transformation costs and acquisition disposition and other related charges 

in fiscal 2018 we recorded 20 billion of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year these amounts primarily included 20 billion of income tax benefits related to the settlement of certain preseparation tax liabilities for which we shared joint and several liability with hp inc and for which we were partially indemnified by hp inc under the tax matters agreement 208 million of income tax benefits related to everett predivestiture tax matters and valuation allowances 125 million of income tax benefits on restructuring charges separation costs transformation costs and acquisition and other related charges and 65 million of income tax benefits on net excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation the effects of which were partially offset by 422 million of income tax charges related to impacts of the tax act

forthcoming segment realignments 

in order to align our segment financial reporting structure more closely with our current business structure effective november 1 2020 we will report the following changes to our reportable segments the lifecycle event services business which was previously reported within the a  ps segment will be reported within each of the related hardware segments certain software related business offerings previously reported within compute storage and a  ps will be combined and reported within the corporate investments segment and the remainder of a  ps which was previously reported as a reportable segment will be reported within the corporate investments segment additionally stockbased compensation expense which was previously reported within segment operating results will be now be reported as a corporate cost 

as previously discussed in the overview section of this mda during fiscal 2020 we experienced a net revenue decline due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and the worldwide demand environment given the comprehensive impact of the pandemic and to avoid repetition the following discussion of the financial performance of each segment in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 will focus on the other leading factors contributing to their performance 

compute 



fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 

compute net revenue decreased by 14 billion or 105 decreased 93 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 

net revenue in compute declined due to multiple factors including competitive pricing pressures manufacturing capacity constraints in north america in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and unfavorable currency fluctuations as a result for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 compute experienced a decline in unit shipments and average unit selling prices 

compute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 41 percentage points for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to an increase in costs of products as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to competitive pricing pressures unfavorable currency fluctuations higher supply chain costs and the scale of the net revenue decline partially offset by lower commodity costs the increase in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue was due to the scale of the net revenue decline while total operating expenses declined yearoveryear due primarily to lower spending due to cost containment measures put in place in response to covid19 and lower variable compensation expense these declines were partially offset by higher field selling costs 

fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 

compute net revenue decreased by 15 billion or 99 decreased 87 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 

net revenue in compute declined as we continued to execute on our hpe next transformation initiative which included streamlining our offerings and business processes and shifting investments in innovation towards high growth and highermargin solutions and services the decline in revenue was due primarily to lower tier 1 server sales and lower revenue from china as part of our strategic move to exit less profitable product categories and certain markets and unfavorable currency fluctuations also weak demand in the enterprise market led to lower revenue from iss core products as well as longer sales cycles as a result for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 compute experienced a decline in unit shipments while average unit selling prices increased 

compute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 28 percentage points for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to a decrease in costs of products as a percentage of net revenue offset by an increase in

operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the decrease in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue was due to a combination of factors including yearoveryear decrease in commodity costs lower costs of products and services due to our cost management initiatives and a lower mix of revenue from lowermargin tier1 server sales coupled with a higher mix of revenue from highermargin products which were partially offset by increased competitive pricing pressures the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to the scale of the net revenue decline while total operating expenses declined yearoveryear due primarily to our hpe next initiative to streamline business processes 

hpc  mcs 





fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 

hpc  mcs net revenu e increased by 126 million or 43 increased 46 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 

the increase in hpc  mcs net revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue in hpc due to the addition of product and services revenue resulting from cray the net revenue increase in hpc was partially offset by a revenue decline in edge compute and mcs 

hpc  mcs earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 32 percentage points in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by a lower cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue the decrease in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to improved product mix from the acquisition of cray the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to the addition of operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of cray 

fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 

hpc  mcs net reve nue decreased by 77 million or 26 decreased 22 on a c onstant currency basis in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 

the decrease in hpc  mcs net revenue was primarily due to the combination of lower revenue in services the mcs product portfolio and with edge compute products this decrease was partially offset by growth in the hpc product portfolio due to the increased apollo product revenue 

hpc  mcs earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 19 percentage points in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due to an increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to lower mix of lowercost mcs products and services the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to investments in research and development partially offset by a decrease in administrative expense

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 50 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2020 were the euro japanese yen british pound and chinese yuan renminbi for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and from time to time options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales operating expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2020 and 2019 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2020 and 2019 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 29 million and 31 million at october 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued our investment portfolio and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing 

we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar based floating or fixed interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however in circumstances where we believe additional fixedrate debt would be beneficial we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap or swap certain floating interest payments to fixed 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments by entering into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2020 and 2019 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2020 and 2019 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our 

debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 47 million and 39 million at october 31 2020 and 2019 respectively

on november 1 2015 hp inc former parent formerly known as hewlettpackard company hp co spunoff hewlett packard enterprise company we us our hewlett packard enterprise hpe or the company pursuant to a separation agreement the separation and distribution agreement collectively the separation to effect the spinoff hp inc distributed all of the shares of hewlett packard enterprise company hpe common stock owned by hp inc to its stockholders on november 1 2015 holders of hp inc common stock received one share of hewlett packard enterprise company stock for every share of hp inc stock held as of the record date as a result of the separation we now operate as an independent publiclytraded company 

separation transactions 

on april 1 2017 we completed the separation and merger of our enterprise services business with computer sciences corporation “csc” collectively the “everett transaction” the everett transaction was accomplished by a series of transactions among csc hpe everett spinco inc a whollyowned subsidiary of hpe “everett” and new everett merger sub inc a whollyowned subsidiary of everett “merger sub” we transferred the enterprise services business to everett and distributed all of the shares of everett to hpe stockholders following the distribution of shares the merger sub merged with and into csc which became a whollyowned subsidiary of everett at the time of the merger everett changed its name to dxc technology company “dxc” 

on september 1 2017 we completed the separation and merger of our software business segment with micro focus international plc “micro focus” collectively the “seattle transaction” the seattle transaction was accomplished by a series of transactions among hpe micro focus seattle spinco inc a whollyowned subsidiary of hpe “seattle” and seattle mergersub inc an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of micro focus “merger sub” we transferred the software business to seattle and distributed all of the shares of seattle to hpe stockholders following the distribution of shares the merger sub merged with and into seattle which became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of micro focus 

upon the completion of the everett and seattle transactions we reclassified the historical financial results of our former enterprise services segment former es segment and our former software segment to net loss from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of earnings and to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets 

hpe next 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we launched an initiative called hpe next through which we are in the process of putting in place a purposebuilt company designed to compete and win in the markets where we participate through this initiative we are simplifying our operating model and the way we work streamlining our offerings and business processes to improve our execution more importantly we will continue to shift our investments in innovation towards high growth and highermargin solutions and services 

this initiative includes consolidating our manufacturing and support services locations streamlining our business systems and reducing the number of countries in which we have a direct sales presence while simultaneously migrating to a channelonly model in the remaining countries 

the hpe next initiative is expected to be implemented through fiscal 2020 during the remaining implementation period we expect to incur expenses for workforce reductions to upgrade and simplify our it infrastructure and for other nonlabor actions these expenses will be partially offset by proceeds received from the remaining real estate sales 

our strategy

at hpe we help our customers thrive from every edge to any cloud 

our business segments products and services 

we organize our business into the following four segments 

 a summary of our net revenue earnings from operations and assets for our segments can be found in note 3 segment information to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii a discussion of certain factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in item 1a risk factors 

hybrid it 

hybrid it provides a broad portfolio of servicesled and softwareenabled infrastructure and solutions including secure softwaredefined servers storage and hpe pointnext services thereby combining hpes hardware software and services capabilities to make hybrid it simple for its customers described below are the business unit capabilities within hybrid it 



technology from the blue data and mapr acquisitions for expertise in artificial intelligence machine learning and analytics data management hpe 3par storage and hpe nimble storage allflash arrays for mission critical workloads and general purpose workloads respectively and big data solutions running on hpe apollo servers storage also provides comprehensive data protection with hpe storeonce and hpe recovery manager central solutions for secondary workloads and traditional tape storage networking and disk products such as hpe modular storage arrays msa and hpe xp 

 intelligent edge 

the intelligent edge business is comprised of a portfolio of secure e dgetocloud solutions operating under the aruba brand that include wireless lan campus and data center switching softwaredefined wideareanetworking security and associated services to enable secure connectivity for businesses of any size the primary business drivers for intelligent edge solutions are mobility and iot 

   financial services 

financial services provides flexible investment solutions such as leasing financing it consumption and utility programs and asset management services for customers that facilitate unique technology deployment models and the acquisition of complete it solutions including hardware software and services from hewlett packard enterprise and others in order to provide flexible services and capabilities that support the entire it life cycle fs partners with customers globally to help build investment strategies that enhance their business agility and support their business transformation fs offers a wide selection of investment solution capabilities for large enterprise customers and channel partners along with an array of financial options to smbs and educational and governmental entities 

corporate investments 

corporate investments includes cms hewlett packard labs and certain business incubation projects 

pending segment realignments 

in order to align our segment financial reporting more closely with our current business structure bring more visibility and transparency to hybrid it and further align to the evolving market landscape effective november 1 2019 we will report the following four new reportable segments compute high performance compute hpc  mission critical servers mcs storage and advisory  professional services aps as a result of this change operational services which was previously reported within hpe pointnext services will be reported within each of the related individual new segments the intelligent edge financial services and corporate investments segments will remain largely unchanged 

our strengths 

we believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors including 



developments like cloud artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to drive business outcomes now and in the future we also have a strong balance sheet that provides the flexibility and speed to take advantage of acquisition opportunities 

 sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups including business and public sector enterprises and purchases of our products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

 the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses for example through our hpe next initiative we have reduced the number of countries in which we have a direct sales presence while simultaneously migrating to a channelonly model in the remaining countries we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers 

the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design the use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand in addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

historically we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for certain customized parts although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are geographically concentrated when necessary we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we may also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products 

a summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in note 3 segment information to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii approximately 67 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2019 came from outside the united states 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and —we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 14 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success our research and development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

expenditures for research and development were 18 billion in fiscal 2019 17 billion in fiscal 2018 and 15 billion in fiscal 2017 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products services and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive 

position for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer in item 1a 

patents 

our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at present our worldwide patent portfolio includes approximately 15000 issued and pending patents 

patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend and —our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties in item 1a 

backlog 

we believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to our diverse product and service portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months see item 1a risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

competition 

we have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise it infrastructure products solutions and services we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business we compete primarily on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our it infrastructure offerings 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are relatively short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services continuously enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above among others in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

hybrid it operates in the highly competitive data center infrastructure market which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition our primary competitors include technology vendors such as dell technologies inc cisco systems inc netapp inc lenovo group ltd international business machines corporation huawei technologies co ltd amazoncom inc oracle corporation fujitsu limited juniper networks inc inspur co ltd hitachi ltd extreme networks inc pure storage inc vmware nutanix inc google inc and rackspace inc in certain regions we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or whitebox manufacturers our strategy is to deliver superior products highvalue technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure software and services capabilities our competitive advantages include our broad endtoend solutions portfolio supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem 

intelligent edge operates in the highly competitive networking and connectivity infrastructure market which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition our primary competitors include technology vendors such as cisco systems inc extreme networks inc juniper networks inc fortinet inc ruckus wireless inc arista networks inc dell technologies inc and huawei technologies co ltd our strategy is to deliver superior enterprise wired and wireless localarea networking components and software highvalue technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure software and services capabilities our competitive advantages include our broad endtoend solutions portfolio supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem 

financial services in our financing business our primary competitors are captive financing companies such as ibm global financing dell financial services and cisco capital as well as banks and other financial institutions our primary it asset disposition itad competitors are eri ingram micro sage sustainable electronics and sims recycling solutions we believe our competitive advantage over banks other financial institutions and itad providers is our ability to bring together our investment solutions with our expertise in managing technology assets not only are we able to deliver investment solutions that help customers create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs but we also help them extract value from existing it investments while more efficiently managing the retirement of those assets all of these solutions can help customers accelerate digital transformation create new budget streams and meet circular economy objectives 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments see risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance in item 1a 

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management movement and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products and in some cases laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances some of our products and services also are or may in the future be subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design procurement operations and transportation and shipping infrastructure as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to recycling and reuse of materials as part of the transition to a circular economy the chemical and materials composition of our products appropriate product packaging and labeling their safe use and their energy efficiency including requirements relating to climate change we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including servers and networking equipment financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations services and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change as these laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance 

with related laws regulations and treaties see risk factorsour business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations in item 1a 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities

risks related to our business 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we deliver global edge to cloud platformasaservice to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from all of their data everywhere hpe delivers unique open and intelligent technology solutions with a consistent experience across all clouds and edge computing platforms to successfully execute this strategy we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by improving cost structure aligning sales coverage with strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution product range and ease of use account relationships customer training service and support and security of our offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example the development of cloudbased solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer  

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement moreover some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting 

demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

our transition to a subscriptionbased business model may adversely affect our business operating results and free cash flow   

we are currently transitioning to an asaservice company providing our entire portfolio through a range of subscriptionbased payperuse and asaservice offerings we will also continue to provide our hardware and software in a capital expenditure and licensebased model ultimately giving our customers choice in consuming hpe products and services in a traditional or asaservice offering such business model changes entail significant risks and uncertainties and we may be unable to complete the transition to a subscriptionbased business model or manage the transition successfully and in a timely manner and our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results may be adversely affected additionally we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the subscription transition even if we successfully complete the transition the transition to a subscriptionbased business model also means that our historical results especially those achieved before we began the transition may not be indicative of our future results further as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings for which revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery and our asaservice offerings for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 

in addition the transition to an asaservice company is expected to require incremental capital requirements resulting in a negative impact to cash flows in the near term and may require us to dedicate additional resources including sales and marketing costs furthermore we anticipate needing to redesign our gotomarket structure to better align with the subscriptionbased business model there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these adjustments in a timely or costeffective manner or that we will be able to realize all or any of the expected benefits from such adjustments 

  

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates and costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses further ongoing us federal government spending priorities may limit demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions 

sales outside the united states constituted approximately 67 of our net revenue in fiscal 2019 our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 



 the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the fcpa although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability variations in fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in addition newer geographic market opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations 

moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of solutions that we offer the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain solutions problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply and contractual relational and labor risks each of which is described below 

component shortages we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also our customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays 

 business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural or human induced disasters including but not limited to earthquakes tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions power or water shortages telecommunications failures materials scarcity and price volatility and medical epidemics or pandemics we are predominantly selfinsured to mitigate the 

impact of most catastrophic events climate change serves as a risk multiplier increasing both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations therefore forecasting disruptive events and building additional resiliency into our operations accordingly will become an increasing business imperative the occurrence of business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california which suffers from drought conditions and catastrophic wildfires affecting the health and safety of our employees to mitigate wildfire risk electric utilities are deploying public safety power shutoffs psps which affects electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in 2017 our principal worldwide it data centers in houston were flooded due hurricane harvey since then hpe has increased its resiliency through site selection and infrastructure investments to mitigate physical risks from climate change the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including the czech republic mexico china and singapore we also rely on major logistics hubs which are strategically located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to hpe’s distribution channels and customers our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near vulnerable locations is continuing to be assessed  

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our businesses our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

changes in us trade policy including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the us government has adopted a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate or potentially terminate certain existing bilateral or multilateral trade agreements it has also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods including information and communication technology products these measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices result in lowering our margin on products sold changes in us trade policy have resulted in and could result in more us trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions for example in september 2019 we acquired cray inc a global supercomputer leader in may 2016 we completed the sale to tsinghua holdings co ltd tsinghua the asset management arm of tsinghua university in china of a 51 interest in our wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates h3c technologies and our chinabased server storage and technology services businesses for approximately 26 billion on april 1 2017 and september 1 2017 we spun off our enterprise services and software businesses respectively see also the risk factors below under the heading “risks related to the separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment” 

risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 

 we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 

 we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have announced restructuring plans including the hpe next initiative and previously announced 2012 plan and the 2015 plan each as defined below in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs as well as simplify our organizational structure upgrade our it infrastructure and redesign business processes we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans including details regarding the 2012 plan and the 2015 plan and the hpe next initiative see note 4 restructuring and note 5 “hpe next” to the consolidated financial statements 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties for example many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become obsolete 

defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement including patent infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hewlett packard enterprise and its customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products discontinue certain product offerings enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition our former parent has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition as discussed in note 18 litigation and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association of 34 countries including the united states has proposed changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these proposals if finalized and adopted by the associated countries will likely increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

as described in note 19 “guarantees indemnifications and warranties” during fiscal 2019 we executed a termination and mutual release agreement which terminated our tax matters agreement with hp inc because we now have limited indemnity rights from hp inc we potentially bear more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments 

uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” the tax act makes changes to the corporate tax rate businessrelated deductions and taxation of foreign earnings among others that are generally effective for our taxable years beginning after october 31 2017 the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret and issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied and administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made at this stage it is unclear how many us states will incorporate these federal law changes or portions thereof into their tax codes the implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package 

including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened 

our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or it services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the energy performance of our products and operations the discharge of pollutants the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the material content of our products and the recycling as well as treatment and disposal of our products in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and material composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

in addition our business is subject to an ever growing number of laws addressing privacy and information security in particular we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the 

security of our offerings if we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy or security we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions our potential exposure includes regulatory fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty claims and reputational damage 

our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

hewlett packard enterprises stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hewlett packard enterprises performance also may affect the price of hewlett packard enterprises stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service standard  poors ratings services and fitch ratings services despite these investment grade credit ratings any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts additionally increased borrowing costs including those arising from a credit rating downgrade can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

in addition to our current total carrying debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future this collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors including 



to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks described above could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to service or refinance our debt 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

 these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hewlett packard enterprise as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hewlett packard enterprise could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hewlett packard enterprise stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hewlett packard enterprise stock 

risks related to the separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment 

the stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment could result in significant tax liability and dxc or micro focus as applicable may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us 

the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our software segment were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of i the relevant distribution and related transactions as a “reorganization” within the meaning of sections 368a 361 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and ii the relevant merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a of the code while the software separation generally qualified for taxfree treatment for us seattle spinco and micro focus the acquisition of seattle spinco by micro focus resulted in the recognition of gain but not loss for us persons who received micro focus american depositary shares in the software separation 

each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us everett spinco and csc or us seattle spinco and micro focus as applicable if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized notwithstanding the opinions of counsel the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position 

if the distribution of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who receive everett spinco shares or seattle spinco shares in the 

relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

we obtained private letter rulings from the irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation of our enterprise services business and software segment those rulings concluded that certain transactions in those separations are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the conclusions of the irs private letter rulings were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete the validity of the irs private letter rulings may be affected notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment including nonus tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material if the completed separation of our former enterprise services business or software segment including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those separations are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor dxc andor micro focus could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

under the tax matters agreements entered into by us with everett spinco and csc and with seattle spinco and micro focus everett spinco and seattle spinco generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by or acquisitions of capital stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable any such indemnity obligations could be material 

risks related to the prior separation from former parent 

we continue to face a number of risks related to the separation from our former parent including those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc entered into several agreements including among others the separation and distribution agreement an employee matters agreement the employee matters agreement and a real estate matters agreement the real estate matters agreement these agreements determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for their respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations in these agreements hp inc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify hp inc for certain liabilities including crossindemnities that are designed and intended to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of hp inc’s business with hp inc we are obligated to indemnify hp inc against certain liabilities including those primarily associated with our business activities and for any breaches of the separation and distribution agreement or any of the ancillary agreements although hp inc has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities third parties could seek to hold us responsible for such liabilities hp incs insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for such liabilities and there can be no assurance that any such indemnity by hp inc or its insurers will be sufficient to protect us from the full amount of liabilities incurred and even if sufficient it is possible that we will need to temporarily bear the cost of such liability while pursuing judgment each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation and distribution our former parent undertook several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which along with the separation and distribution may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation and distribution any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation and distribution 



the allocation of intellectual property rights that was made between hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc as part of the separation and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could in the future adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hp co allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively as a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hp inc could also adversely affect the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation hewlett packard enterprise no longer has ownership of intellectual property allocated to hp inc and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement and patent licensing our ability to sell our products or services and our competitive position in the industry

overview 

we are a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud we enable customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models creating new customer and employee experiences and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by william r hewlett and david packard and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers 

we organize our business into four segments for financial reporting purposes hybrid it intelligent edge financial services fs and corporate investments the following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 





 net revenue decreased by 17 billion or 56 decreased 43 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 as we continue to execute on our hpe next transformation initiative which includes streamlining our offerings and business processes and shifting investments in innovation to high growth and highermargin solutions and services in addition to these planned actions we experienced uneven demand in fiscal 2019 due to an uncertain macroeconomic environment along with gotomarket execution issues in certain business areas and unfavorable currency fluctuations 

the leading contributors to the net revenue decline was lower revenue of 17 billion in hybrid it primarily in compute due to a decline in tier1 server sales and lower revenue from china as we continue to exit less profitable product categories and certain markets also within hybrid it weak demand in the enterprise market led to lower revenue from industry standard server iss core products within compute and from hpe pointnext services to a lesser extent we experienced a revenue decline in intelligent edge due to lower sales of wlan and switching products and in financial services due to lower rental revenue the overall net revenue decline was partially offset by revenue growth in hpe aruba services within intelligent edge 

gross margin was 326 95 billion and 299 92 billion for fiscals 2019 and 2018 respectively the 27 percentage point increase in gross margin was due primarily to hybrid it as a result of the yearoveryear decrease in commodity costs cost management initiatives and a lower mix of revenue from lowermargin tier1 server sales along with a higher mix of revenue from highermargin products operating margin decreased 12 percentage points in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to higher acquisition disposition and other related charges as a result of a onetime charge associated with an arbitration settlement and increased investments in research and development these increases were partially offset by the higher gross margin 

as of october 31 2019 cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and longterm investments were 41 billion representing a decrease of approximately 10 billion from the october 31 2018 balance of 51 billion the decrease was due primarily to the following investments in property plant and equipment net of sales proceeds of 23 billion cash payments related to share repurchases and dividends of 29 billion and business acquisition activity of 15 billion partially offset by cash provided by

trends and uncertainties 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges include dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the market shift of workloads to cloudrelated it infrastructure business models emergence of softwaredefined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality and growth in it consumption models certain of our legacy hardware businesses in hybrid it face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products therefore the demand environment for traditional server and storage products is challenging and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is impacting support attach opportunities in hpe pointnext within the hybrid it segment 

another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others 

a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution we are transitioning to an asaservice company providing our entire portfolio through a range of subscriptionbased payperuse and asaservice offerings however we will continue to provide our customers choice in consuming hpe products and services in a traditional or asaservice offering 

to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by successfully transitioning to our asaservice model further improving our cost structure aligning sales coverage with our strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus which includes accelerating growth in the intelligent edge and delivering profitable growth in hybrid it we need to continue to pursue new product innovation that builds on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking which will keep us aligned with market demand industry trends and the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we launched an initiative called hpe next through which we are putting in place a purposebuilt company designed to compete and win in the markets where we participate through this initiative we are simplifying our operating model and the way we work and streamlining our offerings and business processes to improve our execution more importantly we are shifting our investments in innovation towards high growth and highermargin solutions and services such as an edgetocloud data platform multicloud management through onesphere consumptionbased service models with hpe greenlake and the adoption of composable infrastructure the hpe next initiative includes consolidating our manufacturing and support services locations streamlining our business systems and reducing the number of countries in which we have a direct sales presence while simultaneously migrating to a channelonly model in the remaining countries for additional details on the hpe next initiative see note 5 hpe next to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hpes board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

general 

as a result of adopting the new revenue recognition standard asc 606 we now account for a contract with a customer when both parties have provided written approval and are committed to perform each party’s rights including payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collection of consideration is probable 

we enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products andor various services we determine whether each product or service is distinct in order to identify the performance obligations in the contract and allocate the contract transaction price among the distinct performance obligations arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether the commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software licenses and softwareasaservice saas as distinct performance obligations term software licenses represent multiple obligations which include software licenses and software maintenance in transactions where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis 

the majority of our revenue is derived from sales of product and the associated support and maintenance which is recognized when or as control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services variable consideration offered in contracts with customers partners and distributors may include rebates volumebased discounts cooperative marketing price protection and other incentive programs variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available and recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur 

transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer transfer of control can also occur over time for maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided saas arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services on our product sales we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales revenue is recorded net of any associated sales taxes

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

significant judgments 

we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis the standalone selling price ssp is the price at which an entity would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer we establish ssp for most of our products and services based on the observable price of the products or services when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers when the ssp is not directly observable we estimate ssp based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives pricing strategies marketcompetitive conditions historical profitability data as well as other observable inputs we establish ssp ranges for our products and services and reassesses them periodically 

judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration may include various rebates volumebased discounts cooperative marketing price protection and other incentive programs that are offered to customers partners and distributors when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these programs applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available we also consider the customers right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from one to five years for parts and labor depending upon the product for certain networking products we offer a lifetime warranty over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately 14 of annual net product revenue 

restructuring 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the value of lease and contract cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 4 restructuring and note 5 hpe next to the consolidated financial statements 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 6 retirement and postretirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions of discount rates the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2019

taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we will adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future sources of taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the us in connection with the tax act substantially all accumulated undistributed earnings became subject to us tax in addition future earnings from nonus operations will largely be subject to us tax therefore the indefinitely reinvested undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences represent amounts that are not currently subject to us tax posttax act and are not expected to be subject to us tax in the foreseeable future 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 95 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest uncertain tax positions from acquired companies as well as preseparation state income tax liabilities of hp inc for which the company is jointly and severally liable for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 8 taxes on earnings to the consolidated financial statements 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product lifecycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test we perform a quantitative test for each of our reporting units as part of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level as of october 31 2019 our reporting units containing goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 3 “segment information” to the consolidated financial statements 

in the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge 

estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows risk adjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly traded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is impaired the goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 46 to 52 of the respective carrying amounts in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit based on the results of this hypothetical 10 decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount

intangible assets 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach 

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes at october 31 2019  the gross notional amount of our derivative portfolio was 242 billion  assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 468 million and 147 million  respectively as of october 31 2019  

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves company and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 13 fair value and note 14 financial instruments respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters which arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in note 18 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2019  it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and doesnt adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of a current year revenue converted to us dollars using the prioryear periods foreign currency exchange rates divided by b prioryear period revenue this information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes

impairment of goodwill 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 hybrid it segment management changed its evaluation of hybrid it to evaluate the previously integrated cms business separately from the remainder of hybrid it resulting in a reassessment of the reporting units this change in segment management review triggered an interim goodwill test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and based on that test the fair value of cms was lower than its carrying value leading to a goodwill impairment charge of 88 million in fiscal 2018 

restructuring charges

fs net revenue increased by 69 million  or 19 increased 04 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2018 due primarily to favorable foreign currency fluctuations and higher asset management revenue from endoflease monthly rentals remarketing sales and lease extensions partially offset by a decrease in rental revenue due to lower average operating leases and lower lease buyout revenue due primarily to a large customer buyout transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 

fs earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 06 percentage points due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset with an increase in gross margin operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due primarily to higher marketing administrative and field selling costs the increase in gross margin was due primarily to favorable foreign currency fluctuations higher asset management activity related to lease extensions and higher margins on lease buyouts which was partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense in the current period 

financing volume 



new financing volume which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services including intercompany activity decreased by 49 in fiscal 2019 and increased 72 in fiscal 2018 as compared to the prioryear periods the decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by unfavorable currency fluctuations along with lower financing associated with hpe and thirdparty product sales and related service offerings the increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by higher financing associated with thirdparty product sales and related service offerings along with favorable currency fluctuations 

portfolio assets and ratios 

the fs business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system the accounting policies used to derive fs amounts are substantially the same as those used by the company however intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures product development initiatives acquisition and disposal activities including legal settlements restructuring activities transformation costs indemnifications maturing debt interest payments income tax payments in addition to any future investments and any future share repurchases and future stockholder dividend payments we expect to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary by accessing the capital markets issuing commercial paper and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions however our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a each of which is incorporated herein by reference 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with a substantial amount held outside of the us we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position is strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

amounts held outside of the us are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs due to the enactment of the tax act all of our cash cash equivalents restricted cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to us taxation under the onetime transition tax as further discussed in note 8 taxes on earnings subsequent repatriations generally will not be taxable from a us federal tax perspective but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the us and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

on october 13 2015 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with a 30 billion authorization which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of 30 billion 50 billion and 25 billion on may 24 2016 october 16 2017 and february 21 2018 respectively as of october 31 2019 we had a remaining authorization of 25 billion for future share repurchases the number of shares that we repurchase under the share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including share price liquidity and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion additionally our share repurchase activity if any during any particular period may fluctuate we may commence accelerate suspend delay or discontinue any share repurchase activity at any time without notice this program does not have a specific expiration date

liquidity 

our cash cash equivalents restricted cash total debt and available borrowing resources were as follows 



our key cash flow metrics were as follows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 10 billion for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was driven primarily by higher cash generated from working capital management lower payments related to our ongoing hpe next fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2012 restructuring plans cash generated as a result of the settlement of the tax matters agreement pursuant to the termination and mutual release agreement with hp inc and higher profitability the effects of which were partially offset by an arbitration award settlement with dxc net cash provided by operating activities increased 16 billion for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to higher net earnings in fiscal 2018 and a payment of 19 billion for pension funding in connection with the everett transaction in fiscal 2017 partially offset by higher cash usage for net working capital management in fiscal 2018 

our key working capital metrics were as follows 



days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal 2019 as compared to the prioryear period dso remained flat as a result of the improvements in collections being offset with unfavorable currency fluctuations and extended payment terms for fiscal 2018 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dso was due primarily to unfavorable billing linearity partially offset by an increase in early payments and factoring 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2019 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dos was due primarily to an increase in inventory resulting from the acquisition of cray inc for fiscal 2018 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dos was due primarily to higher levels of strategic commodities inventory to support customer demand manage supply risk and component cost increases and higher inventory of server solutions which have longer timetoshipment cycles 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2019 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dpo was primarily the result of increase in lease payables due to slower disbursements payment term extensions and favorable inventory purchasing linearity for fiscal 2018 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in dpo was primarily the result of a reduction in purchases with original equipment manufacturers oems and a shift to internal manufacturing for certain compute products 

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms including extended payment terms from suppliers the extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased by 16 billion in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was due primarily to an increase of 13 billion of cash used for payments made in connection with business acquisitions an increase of 04 billion of cash used for investments in property plant and equipment net of proceeds from sales partially offset by an increase of 02 billion of cash received from net financial collateral activities in the current period net cash used in investing activities decreased by 35 billion in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to lower payments by 20 billion for business acquisitions in addition to an increase in cash of 08 billion from net financial collateral activities and a decrease of 06 billion of cash used for investments in property plant and equipment net of proceeds from sales 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 40 billion in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 the decrease was due primarily to the impact of a higher debt redemption by 19 billion in the prior period an increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt of 11 billion and a lower utilization of cash for share repurchase activity by 13 billion in the current period these amounts were partially offset by a net transfer of cash from seattle of 02 billion in the prior period net cash used in financing activities increased by 58 billion in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to cash dividends of 30 billion and 25 billion from everett and seattle respectively in fiscal 2017 higher cash used for share repurchase activity by 10 billion and higher debt redemption by 04 billion in fiscal 2018 partially offset by 11 billion of net transfers of cash and cash equivalents to everett and seattle

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in over 50 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2019 were the euro japanese yen british pound and chinese yuan renminbi for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and from time to time options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales operating expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2019 and 2018 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2019 and 2018 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 31 million and 36 million at october 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued our investment portfolio and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing 

we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar based floating or fixed interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however in circumstances where we believe additional fixedrate debt would be beneficial we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap or swap certain floating interest payments to fixed 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments by entering into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2019 and 2018 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2019 and 2018 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 39 million and 29 million at october 31 2019 and 2018 respectively

  historically we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements to streamline and simplify our operations and reduce our costs through our hpe next initiative we will reduce the number of active configurations that we will sell to our customers our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for certain customized parts although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the 

event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are geographically concentrated when necessary we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we may also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products 

a summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in note 3 segment information to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii approximately 67 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2018 came from outside the united states 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and —we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 14 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success our research and development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

expenditures for research and development were 17 billion in fiscal 2018 15 billion in fiscal 2017 and 17 billion in fiscal 2016 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products services and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer in item 1a 

patents 

our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at present our worldwide patent portfolio includes approximately 16000 issued and pending patents 

patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend and —our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties in item 1a 

backlog 

we believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to our diverse product and service portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months see item 1a risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

competition 

we have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise it infrastructure products solutions and services we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business we compete primarily on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our it infrastructure offerings 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are relatively short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services continuously enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above among others in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

hybrid it  operates in the highly competitive data center infrastructure market which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition our primary competitors include technology vendors such as dell technologies inc cisco systems inc netapp inc lenovo group ltd international business machines corporation huawei technologies co ltd amazoncom inc oracle corporation fujitsu limited juniper networks inc inspur co ltd hitachi ltd extreme networks inc pure storage inc vmware nutanix inc google inc and rackspace inc in certain regions we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or whitebox manufacturers our strategy is to deliver superior products highvalue technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure software and services capabilities our competitive advantages include our broad endtoend solutions portfolio supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem 

intelligent edge  operates in the highly competitive networking and connectivity infrastructure market which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition our primary competitors include technology vendors such as cisco systems inc extreme networks inc juniper networks inc aerohive networks inc fortinet inc ruckus wireless inc arista networks inc dell technologies inc and huawei technologies co ltd our strategy is to deliver superior enterprise wired and wireless localarea networking components and software highvalue technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure software and services capabilities our competitive advantages include our broad endtoend solutions portfolio supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem 

financial services in our financing business our competitors are captive financing companies such as ibm global financing as well as banks and other financial institutions we believe our competitive advantage over banks and other financial institutions in our financing business is our ability to deliver flexible investment solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments see risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance in item 1a 

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products and in some cases laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances some of our products and services also are or may in the future be subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to recycling and reuse of materials as part of the transition to a circular economy the chemical and materials composition of our products appropriate product packaging and labeling their safe use and their energy efficiency including requirements relating to climate change we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including servers and networking equipment financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations services and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change as these laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating hewlett packard enterprise and its common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of hardware software and services as we deliver hybrid it solutions to our customers and power the intelligent edge that runs campus branch and internet of things applications to successfully execute this strategy we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by improving cost structure aligning sales coverage with strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their 

business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example the development of cloudbased solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer  

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement moreover some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past 

considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates and costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses further ongoing us federal government spending limits may limit demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions 

sales outside the united states constituted approximately 67 of our net revenue in fiscal 2018 our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 



 the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the fcpa although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability variations in fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to 

optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with singlesource suppliers each of which is described below 

 business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural or human induced disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions power or water shortages telecommunications failures and medical epidemics or pandemics we are predominantly selfinsured to mitigate the impact of most catastrophic events however a changing climate may aggravate natural disasters that affect our worldwide business operations thereby compelling us to build additional resiliency in order to mitigate impact the occurrence of business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our 

costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california which has suffered from drought conditions and catastrophic wildfires affecting the health and safety of our employees other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to climaterelated natural disasters such as 2017 hurricane harvey which caused severe damage in houston the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including the czech republic mexico china and singapore we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near vulnerable locations is continuing to be assessed  

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our businesses our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

changes in us trade policy including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the us government has adopted a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate or potentially terminate certain existing bilateral or multilateral trade agreements it has also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods including information and communication technology products these measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the united states this in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand or if we are unable to increase prices result in lowering our margin on products sold changes in us trade policy have resulted in and could result in more us trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions for example in april 2017 we acquired nimble storage inc which provides predictive allflash and hybridflash storage solutions in may 2016 we completed the sale to tsinghua holdings co ltd tsinghua the asset management arm of tsinghua university in china of a 51 interest in our wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates h3c technologies and our chinabased server storage and technology services businesses for approximately 26 billion on april 1 2017 and september 1 2017 we spun off our enterprise services and software businesses respectively see also the risk factors below under the heading “risks related to the separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment” 

risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 

 we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other 

financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 

 we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have announced restructuring plans including the hpe next initiative and previously announced 2012 plan and the 2015 plan each as defined below in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs as well as simplify our organizational structure upgrade our it infrastructure and redesign business processes we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans including details regarding the 2012 plan and the 2015 plan and the hpe next initiative see note 4 restructuring and note 5 “hpe next” to the consolidated financial statements 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties for example many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement including patent infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hewlett packard enterprise and its customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products discontinue certain product offerings enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition our former parent has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition as discussed in 

note 18 litigation and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 

uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” the tax act makes changes to the corporate tax rate businessrelated deductions and taxation of foreign earnings among others that will generally be effective for our taxable years beginning after october 31 2017 these changes could have a material adverse impact on the realizability of our us deferred tax assets result in significant onetime charges in the current or future taxable years and increase our future us tax expense we are continuing to evaluate the tax act and its requirements as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate at this stage it is unclear how many us states will incorporate these federal law changes or portions thereof into their tax codes the implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act reasonable estimates of the impacts of the tax act are provided in accordance with guidance from the us securities and exchange commission that allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the periods in which the adjustments are made 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened 

our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or it services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

as a leading technology firm we are exposed to attacks from criminals nation state actors and activist hackers collectively malicious parties who may be able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures and misappropriate maliciously alter or destroy our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain to embed malicious software or hardware in our products for use in compromising our customers in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our hpe pointnext services business may processes store and transmits data relevant to our clients including commercially sensitive and personally identifiable information including the personal information of european citizens covered by the general data protection regulation gdpr breaches of our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the energy performance of our products and operations the discharge of pollutants the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the material content of our products and the recycling as well as treatment and disposal of our products in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and material composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or 

become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

in addition our business is subject to laws addressing privacy and information security in particular we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings if we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with security we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty claims 

our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

hewlett packard enterprises stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hewlett packard enterprises performance also may affect the price of hewlett packard enterprises stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service standard  poors ratings services and fitch ratings services despite these investment grade credit ratings any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts additionally increased borrowing costs including those arising from a credit rating downgrade can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

in addition to our current total carrying debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future this collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors including 



 to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks described above could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to service or refinance our debt 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

 these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hewlett packard enterprise as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hewlett packard enterprise could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hewlett packard enterprise stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hewlett packard enterprise stock 

risks related to the separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment 

the stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment could result in significant tax liability and dxc or micro focus as applicable may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us 

the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our software segment were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of i the relevant distribution and related transactions as a “reorganization” within the meaning of sections 368a 361 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and ii the relevant merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a of the code while the software separation generally qualified for taxfree treatment for us seattle spinco and micro focus the acquisition of seattle spinco by micro focus resulted in the recognition of gain but not loss for us persons who receive micro focus american depositary shares in the software separation 

each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us everett spinco and csc or us seattle spinco and micro focus 

as applicable if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized notwithstanding the opinions of counsel the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position 

if the distribution of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who receive everett spinco shares or seattle spinco shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

we obtained private letter rulings from the irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation of our enterprise services business and software segment those rulings concluded that certain transactions in those separations are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the conclusions of the irs private letter rulings were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete the validity of the irs private letter rulings may be affected notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment including nonus tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and software segment in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material if the completed separation of our former enterprise services business or software segment including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those separations are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor dxc andor micro focus could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

under the tax matters agreements entered into by us with everett spinco and csc and with seattle spinco and micro focus everett spinco and seattle spinco generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by or acquisitions of capital stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable any such indemnity obligations could be material 

risks related to the prior separation from former parent

judgment of such counsel or advisor which is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly notwithstanding receipt by hp co of the irs private letter ruling and the tax opinions referred to above there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge hp inc hewlett packard enterprise and hp co stockholders who received hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability

indemnification liabilities to hp inc pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the separation and distribution agreement provides for among other things indemnification obligations generally designed to make us financially responsible for i liabilities primarily associated with our business ii our failure to pay perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such liabilities or contracts in accordance with their respective terms whether prior to at or after the distribution iii any guarantee indemnification obligation surety bond or other credit support agreement arrangement commitment or understanding by hp inc for our benefit unless related to liabilities primarily associated with the hp inc business iv any breach by us of the separation agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any action by us in contravention of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws and v any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading with respect to all information contained in our registration statement on form 10 or any other disclosure document that describes the separation or the distribution or hewlett packard enterprise and its subsidiaries or primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by the separation and distribution agreement subject to certain exceptions if we are required to indemnify hp inc under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

in connection with the separation hp inc has indemnified us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that hp incs ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements we have entered into with hp inc hp inc has agreed to indemnify hewlett packard enterprise for certain liabilities however third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that hp inc has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from hp inc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that hp inc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition hp incs insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the separation moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from hp inc or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities as a result of our separation from our former parent 

as a result of the separation from our former parent there are several significant areas where the liabilities of our former parent have or may become our obligations for example under the code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the consolidated us federal income tax return group of our former parent during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the distribution is severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the consolidated us federal income tax return group of our former parent for that taxable period consequently if hp inc is unable to pay the consolidated us federal income tax liability for a preseparation period we could be required to pay the amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation and distribution our former parent undertook several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which along with the separation and distribution may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation and distribution any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation and distribution 

 the allocation of intellectual property rights that was made between hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc as part of the separation and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could in the future adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hp co allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively as a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hp inc could also adversely affect the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation hewlett packard enterprise no longer has ownership of intellectual property allocated to hp inc and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement and patent licensing our ability to sell our products or services and our competitive position in the industry

 overview 

we are a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud we enable customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models creating new customer and employee experiences and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by william r hewlett and david packard and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers 

we organize our business into four segments for financial reporting purposes hybrid it intelligent edge financial services fs and corporate investments the following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 





 net revenue increased by 20 billion or 69 increased 50 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 the leading contributor to the net revenue increase was higher product revenue of 14 billion in hybrid it due primarily to revenue growth in compute from core industry standard servers iss products due to higher average unit prices aups and growth in storage as a result of the nimble storage acquisition also contributing to the hpe net revenue increase was favorable currency fluctuations growth in the intelligent edge primarily from campus switching products and higher net revenue in financial services which was primarily due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations 

gross margin was 301 93 billion and 301 87 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively gross margin was unchanged from the prioryear period due primarily to a decline in hybrid it as a result of a higher mix of lower margin solutions and higher variable compensation expense offset by a higher gross margin from financial services and lower costs in corporate investments operating margin increased by 38 percentage points in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to lower expenses for restructuring charges separation costs and acquisition and other related charges and lower selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue partially offsetting these expense declines was 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

higher research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue and higher transformation costs related to the hpe next initiative net of gains from the sale of real estate 

as of october 31 2018 cash and cash equivalents and longterm cash investments were 49 billion representing a decrease of approximately 47 billion from the october 31 2017 balance of 96 billion the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and longterm cash investments during fiscal 2018 was due primarily to the following share repurchases and cash dividend payments of 41 billion debt payments of 41 billion investments in property plant and equipment net of sales proceeds of 19 billion partially offset by 30 billion of cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from debt issuances of 25 billion 

trends and uncertainties 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges include dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the market shift of workloads to cloudrelated it infrastructure business models emergence of softwaredefined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality and growth in it consumption models certain of our legacy hardware businesses in hybrid it face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products therefore the demand environment for traditional server and storage products is challenging and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is impacting support attach opportunities in hpe pointnext within the hybrid it segment 

another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others 

a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution 

to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by improving cost structure aligning sales coverage with our strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus which includes accelerating growth in the intelligent edge and delivering profitable growth in hybrid it we need to continue to pursue new product innovation that builds on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking which will keep us aligned with market demand industry trends and the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we launched an initiative called hpe next through which we are putting in place a purposebuilt company designed to compete and win in the markets where we participate through this initiative we are simplifying our operating model and the way we work we are streamlining our offerings and business processes to improve our execution more importantly we are shifting our investments in innovation towards high growth and higher margin solutions and services such as an edgetocloud data platform multicloud management though onesphere consumptionbased service models with hpe greenlake and the adoption of composable infrastructure the hpe next initiative includes consolidating our manufacturing and support services locations streamlining our business systems and reducing the number of countries in which we have a direct sales presence while simultaneously migrating to a channelonly model in the remaining countries for additional details on the hpe next initiative see note 5 hpe next to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hpes board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements 

we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry lifecycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive 

for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from us and we have completed our obligations related to the sale 

for the various software products we sell we assess whether the software products were sold on a standalone basis or with hardware products if the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware product and is morethanincidental we treat it as a software deliverable 

we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements such as postcontract customer support exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on a whenandifavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered 

for softwareasaservice saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance 

we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts including extended warranty contracts and software postcontract customer support agreements ratably over the contract period for certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made total project costs are regularly reassessed during the life of a fixedprice contract provisions for estimated losses on fixedprice contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

warranty 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from one to five years for parts and labor depending upon the product for certain networking products we offer a lifetime warranty over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately 18  of annual net product revenue 

restructuring 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the value of lease and contract cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 4 restructuring and note 5 hpe next to the consolidated financial statements 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 6 retirement and postretirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions of discount rates the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2018  



taxes on earnings 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we will adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future sources of taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the us in connection with the tax act substantially all accumulated undistributed earnings became subject to us tax in addition future earnings from nonus operations will largely be subject to us tax therefore the indefinitely reinvested undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences represent amounts that are not currently subject to us tax posttax act and are not expected to be subject to us tax in the foreseeable future 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 110 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest as well as preseparation income tax liabilities of hp inc for which the company is jointly and severally liable for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 8 taxes on earnings to the consolidated financial statements 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product lifecycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of earnings in the period it is abandoned the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test we perform a quantitative test for each of our reporting units as part of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on november 1 2017 the companys former eg segment was realigned into two new reportable segments hybrid it and intelligent edge further following certain executive leadership changes in 2018 near the end of the fourth quarter hybrid it segment management changed its evaluation of hybrid it to evaluate the previously integrated communication and media services “cms” business separately from the remainder of hybrid it resulting in a reassessment of the reporting units as of october 31 2018 our reporting units within hybrid it include cms and hybrid it excluding cms we expect to move cms to the corporate investments segment under new management effective november 1 2018 our other reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 3 “segment information” to the consolidated financial statements 

in the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge 

estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows risk adjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly traded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is impaired the goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 29  to 72  of the respective carrying amounts in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10  decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit based on the results of this hypothetical 10  decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount 

subsequent to our annual test date cms was identified as a separate reporting unit within the hybrid it segment due to this triggering event we performed an interim impairment test for cms and based on the results of that analysis the fair value of cms was less than its carrying amount prior to calculating the goodwill impairment loss we analyzed the recoverability of cms longlived assets other than goodwill and concluded such assets were not impaired as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 88 million there is no remaining goodwill in the cms reporting unit as of october 31 2018 

intangible assets 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach 

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes at october 31 2018  the gross notional amount of our derivative portfolio was 239 billion  assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 496 million  and 476 million  respectively as of october 31 2018  

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves company and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 13 fair value and note 14 financial instruments respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters which arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in note 18 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2018  it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and doesnt adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of a current year revenue converted to us dollars using the prioryear periods foreign currency exchange rates divided by b prioryear period revenue this information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes

sga expense decreased by  374 million  or 7  for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  due primarily to the impact of the h3c and mphasis divestitures in fiscal 2016 which represented 294 million of expenses in the prioryear period cost reduction actions favorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower variable compensation expense this decrease was partially offset by higher expenses resulting from business acquisitions in fiscal 2017 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization expense decreased by  27 million  or 8  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  due to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods partially offset by higher amortization expense in the current period related to intangible assets from business acquisitions in fiscal 2017 

amortization expense increased by  49 million  or 18  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  due to the addition of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions in fiscal 2017 partially offset by certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods 

impairment of goodwill 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 hybrid it segment management changed its evaluation of hybrid it to evaluate the previously integrated cms business separately from the remainder of hybrid it resulting in a reassessment of the reporting units this change in segment management review triggered an interim goodwill test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and based on that test the fair value of cms was lower than its carrying value leading to a goodwill impairment charge of 88 million 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges decreased in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  due to the completion of the restructuring plan we announced in september 2015 the 2015 plan in connection with the separation and the plan initially announced in may 2012 the 2012 plan as of october 31 2018 both the 2015 plan and the 2012 plan are complete

our effective tax rates were 6507 603 and 161 in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 233 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include puerto rico and singapore 

we have an october 31 fiscal year end therefore the lower corporate tax rate enacted by the tax act will be phased in resulting in a us statutory federal rate of 233 for the fiscal year ending october 31 2018 and 21 for subsequent fiscal years 

in fiscal 2018 we recorded 20 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year these amounts primarily included 20 billion of income tax benefits related to the settlement of certain preseparation tax liabilities for which we share joint and several liability with hp inc and for which we are partially indemnified by hp inc under the tax matters agreement 208 million of income tax benefits related to everett predivestiture tax matters and valuation allowances 125 million of income tax benefits on restructuring charges separation costs transformation costs and acquisition and other related charges and 65 million of income tax benefits on net excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation the effects of which were partially offset by 422 million of income tax charges related to impacts of the tax act

corporate investments loss from operations decreased by 15  in fiscal 2018  and increased by 74  in fiscal 2017  as compared to the prioryear periods respectively the decline in loss from operations for fiscal 2018 was due to lower expenses in hp labs the increase in loss from operations for fiscal 2017 was due to higher expenses in hp labs and certain cloudrelated activities partially offset by the absence of operating expenses related to mphasis 

liquidity and capital resources 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures product development initiatives acquisitions restructuring activities transformation costs indemnifications maturing debt interest payments income tax payments in addition to any future investments and any future share repurchases and future stockholder dividend payments we expect to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary by accessing the capital markets issuing commercial paper and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions however our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a each of which is incorporated herein by reference 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with a substantial amount held outside of the us we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position is strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

amounts held outside of the us are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to shortterm intercompany loans into the us due to the enactment of the tax act all of our cash cash equivalents and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to us taxation under the onetime transition tax as further discussed in note 8 taxes on earnings subsequent repatriations generally will not be taxable from a us federal tax perspective but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the us and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

on october 13 2015 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with a 30 billion authorization which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of 30 billion 50 billion and 25 billion on may 24 2016 october 16 2017 and february 21 2018 respectively as of october 31 2018 we had a remaining authorization of 47 billion for future share repurchases the number of shares that we repurchase under the share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including share price liquidity and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion additionally our share repurchase activity if any during any particular period may fluctuate we may commence accelerate suspend delay or discontinue any share repurchase activity at any time without notice this program does not have a specific expiration date

days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal 2018 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dso was due primarily to unfavorable billing linearity partially offset by an increase in early payments and factoring for fiscal 2017 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in dso was due primarily to lower aged accounts receivables a reduction in accounts receivables of recent acquisitions and improvements in credit and collections 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2018 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dos was due primarily to higher levels of strategic commodities inventory to support customer demand manage supply risk and component cost increases and higher inventory of server solutions which have longer timetoshipment cycles for fiscal 2017 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dos was due primarily to higher inventory resulting from increases in memory component costs and an increase in inventory as a result of recent acquisitions

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2018 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in dpo was primarily the result of a reduction in purchases with original equipment manufacturers oems and a shift to internal manufacturing for certain compute products for fiscal 2017 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dpo was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers 

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms including extended payment terms from suppliers the extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period and acquisition activity 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 28 billion in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 the decrease was due primarily to payments of 22 billion in the prioryear period in connection with business acquisitions and a decrease of 06 billion of cash used in the current period for investments in property plant and equipment net of proceeds from sales net cash used in investing activities was 49 billion in fiscal 2017 due primarily to 25 billion of investments in property plant and equipment net of proceeds from sales and payments of 22 billion in connection with business acquisitions 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 58 billion in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 the increase was due primarily to cash dividends of 30 billion and 25 billion from everett and seattle respectively in the prior period and higher cash used in the current period for share repurchase activity of 10 billion partially offset by 08 billion of net transfers of cash and cash equivalents to dxc and micro focus in the prior period net cash provided by financing activities was 02 billion in fiscal 2017 due primarily to a 30 billion cash dividend payment from everett a 25 billion cash dividend payment from seattle and 23 billion of cash proceeds from the issuance of debt partially offset by 38 billion of debt redemption payments and 30 billion of cash utilization for repurchases of common stock and dividend payments net cash used in financing activities was 23 billion in fiscal 2016 due primarily to cash utilization for repurchases of common stock and dividend payments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 60 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2018 were the euro japanese yen british pound and chinese yuan renminbi for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and from time to time options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales operating expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2018 and 2017 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2018 and 2017 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 36 million and 39 million at october 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing 

we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments by entering into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2018 and 2017 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2018 and 2017 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our 

debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 29 million and 43 million at october 31 2018 and 2017 respectively

with the completion of the everett and seattle transactions we have reclassified the historical financial results of our former enterprise services segment former es segment and our former software segment to net loss from discontinued operations in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings and to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets 

hpe next 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we launched an initiative called hpe next through which we will architect a purposebuilt company designed to compete and win in the markets where we participate through this initiative we will simplify our operating model and the way we work we will streamline our offerings and business processes to improve our execution more importantly we will continue to shift our investments in innovation towards high growth and higher margin solutions and services 

this initiative includes consolidating our manufacturing and support services locations streamlining our business systems and reducing the number of countries in which we have a direct sales presence while simultaneously migrating to a channelonly model in the remaining countries 

the hpe next initiative is expected to be implemented through fiscal 2020 during this time we expect to incur expenses for workforce reductions to upgrade and simplify our it infrastructure and for other nonlabor actions these costs will be partially offset by proceeds received from real estate sales 

we expect to achieve gross cost savings of 15 billion exiting fiscal 2020 after investing approximately 700 million of the gross savings back into the business we expect to achieve annual runrate net cost savings of approximately 800 million exiting fiscal 2020 

our strategy 

hpe’s strategy is based on three key pillars 

first we make hybrid it simple through secure softwaredefined offerings that enable customers to move data seamlessly across their onpremises data centers private cloud managed cloud and public cloud environments hpe has a deep portfolio of technology solutions to enable the right mix of hybrid it to drive the business outcomes our customers are looking for our portfolio includes industry standard servers hyperconverged offerings high performance compute composable infrastructure allflash storage networking private cloud and multicloud management software equally important to enabling the right mix of hybrid it are our partnerships with other leading technology companies

our business segments products and services 

we organize our business into the following three segments 

 a summary of our net revenue earnings from operations and assets for our segments can be found in note 3 segment information to our consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 of part ii a discussion of certain factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in item 1a risk factors 

enterprise group 

eg provides a broad portfolio of enterprise technology solutions and services including secure softwaredefined servers storage and networking as well as technology services 

  servers we offer both industry standard servers iss which are general purpose servers for multiworkload computing as well as mission critical servers mcs which are servers optimized for particular workloads our general purpose servers include the hpe proliant secure and versatile rack and tower servers hpe bladesystem a modular infrastructure that converges server storage and networking and hpe synergy a composable infrastructure for traditional and cloudnative applications our workload optimized server portfolio includes the hpe apollo for high performance computing and artificial intelligence hpe cloudline for cloud data centers hpe edgeline for computing at the network edge hpe integrity for missioncritical applications and hpe simplivity a hyperconverged platform for virtualization

corporate investments 

corporate investments includes hewlett packard labs and certain cloudrelated business incubation projects 

our strengths 

we believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors including 

strong solutions portfolio for the data center cloud and intelligent edge  we combine our softwaredefined infrastructure and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise solutions in the it industry our ability to deliver a comprehensive it strategy from the cloud to the data center to the intelligent edge through our highquality products and highvalue consulting and support services in a single package is one of our principal differentiators 

multiyear innovation roadmap  we have been in the technology and innovation business for over 75 years our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the expanding amount of data available and leverage the latest technology developments like cloud artificial intelligence and cyber security to drive business outcomes now and in the future 

global distribution and partner ecosystem  we are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions to our customers in complex multicountry multivendor andor multilanguage environments we have one of the largest gotomarket capabilities in our industry including a large ecosystem of channel partners which enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world 

custom financial solutions  we have developed innovative financing solutions and it consumption models to facilitate the delivery of our products and services to our customers we deliver flexible investment solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs 

experienced leadership team with track record of successful performance  our management team has an extensive track record of performance and execution we are led by our chief executive officer margaret c whitman and our president antonio neri who have proven experience in developing transformative business models building global brands and driving sustained growth and expansion in the technology industry ms whitmans experience includes her leadership of hp co for four years prior to the separation and her prior ten years as chief executive officer of ebay inc mr neris experience includes over 20 years combined at hpe and hp co in various leadership positions our senior management team has over 100 collective years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of and experience in the enterprise it business and the markets in which we compete moreover we have a deep bench of management and technology talent that we believe provides us with an unparalleled pipeline of future leaders and innovators 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups including business and public sector enterprises and purchases of our products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

 the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses for example through our hpe next initiative we will reduce the number of countries in which we have a direct sales presence while simultaneously migrating to a channelonly model in the remaining countries we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design the use of outsourced manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand in addition to our use of outsourced manufacturers we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors to generate further cost efficiencies through our hpe next initiative we will reduce the number of our manufacturing locations 

  historically we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements to streamline and simplify our operations and reduce our costs to serve our customers we will reduce the number of active configurations through our hpe next initiative our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for certain customized parts although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources or where our suppliers are geographically concentrated when necessary we are often able to obtain scarce 

components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we may also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products 

a summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in note 3 segment information to our consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 of part ii approximately 66 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2017 came from outside the united states 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and —we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 14 financial instruments to our consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 of part ii which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success our research and development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

expenditures for research and development were  15 billion  in fiscal 2017  17 billion  in fiscal 2016 and  17 billion  in fiscal 2015 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products services and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer in item 1a 

patents 

our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at present our worldwide patent portfolio includes approximately 11000 patents 

patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend and —our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties in item 1a 

backlog 

we believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to our diverse product and service portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months see item 1a risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

competition 

we have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise it infrastructure products solutions and services we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business we compete primarily on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our it infrastructure offerings 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are relatively short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above among others in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

enterprise group eg operates in the highly competitive enterprise technology infrastructure market which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition our primary competitors include technology vendors such as dell technologies inc cisco systems inc netapp inc lenovo group ltd international business machines corporation huawei technologies co ltd amazoncom inc oracle corporation fujitsu limited juniper networks inc inspur co ltd hitachi ltd extreme networks inc pure storage inc vmware nutanix inc google inc and rackspace inc in certain regions we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or whitebox manufacturers our strategy is to deliver superior products highvalue technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure software and services capabilities our competitive advantages include our broad endtoend solutions portfolio supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem 

financial services in our financing business our competitors are captive financing companies mainly ibm global financing as well as banks and other financial institutions we believe our competitive advantage over banks and other financial institutions in our financing business is our ability to deliver flexible investment solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments see risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance in item 1a

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products and in some cases laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances some of our products and services also are or may in the future be subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity 

in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use and their energy efficiency including requirements relating to climate change we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including servers and networking equipment financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations services and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change as these laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating hewlett packard enterprise and its common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of hardware software and services as we deliver hybrid it solutions to our customers and power the intelligent edge that runs campus branch and internet of things applications to successfully execute this strategy we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by improving cost structure aligning sales coverage with strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their 

business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example the development of cloudbased solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer  

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement moreover some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past 

considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses further ongoing us federal government spending limits may limit demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions 

sales outside the united states constituted approximately 66 of our net revenue in fiscal 2017 our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 



 the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the fcpa although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability variations in fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in 

production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with singlesource suppliers each of which is described below 

 business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition 

adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area such as 2017 hurricane harvey which caused severe damage in houston the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including the czech republic mexico china and singapore we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our businesses our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions for example in may 2015 we acquired aruba networks inc which provides nextgeneration network access solutions for mobile enterprise in may 2016 we completed the sale to tsinghua holdings co ltd tsinghua the asset management arm of tsinghua university in china of a 51 interest in our wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates h3c technologies and our chinabased server storage and technology services businesses for approximately 26 billion on april 1 2017 and september 1 2017 we spun off our enterprise services and software businesses respectively see also the risk factors below under the heading “risks related to the separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment” 

risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 



adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans 

 we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 

 we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have announced restructuring plans including the 2012 plan and the 2015 plan each as defined below and the hpe next initiative in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs as well as simplify our organizational structure upgrade our it infrastructure and redesign business processes we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans including details regarding the 2012 plan and the 2015 plan and the hpe next initiative see note 4 restructuring and note 5 “hpe next” to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties for example many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that 

may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement including patent infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hewlett packard enterprise and its customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

the allocation of intellectual property rights that was made between hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc as part of the separation of the two entities and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could in the future adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hp co allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively as a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hp inc could also adversely affect the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation hewlett packard enterprise no longer has ownership of intellectual property allocated to hp inc and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement and patent licensing our ability to sell our products or services and our competitive position in the industry 

failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition our former parent has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition as discussed in note 19 litigation and contingencies to our consolidated and combined financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular if circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the united states future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results of operations as of october 31 2017 we had 120 billion of undistributed earnings from nonus operations indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states see note 8 taxes on earnings to our consolidated and combined financial statements the carrying value of our deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performance 

potential us tax reform could have a material effect on the taxation of our business recently us tax reform bills containing a wide variety of potential changes have been passed by each of the us house of representatives and the us senate certain changes to us tax laws specifically us taxation on earnings from international business operations the deductibility of certain costs and the continuance of certain tax credits if enacted may materially impact our effective tax rate and the amount of taxes we pay 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened 

our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or it services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

as a leading technology firm we are exposed to attacks from criminals nation state actors and activist hackers collectively malicious parties who may be able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures and misappropriate maliciously alter or destroy our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain to embed malicious software in our products for use in compromising our customers in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our pointnext services business may processes store and transmits data relevant to our clients including commercially sensitive and personally identifiable information including the personal information of european citizens covered by the general data protection regulation gdpr breaches of our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our 

products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

in addition our business is subject to laws addressing privacy and information security in particular we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings if we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with security we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty claims 

our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

hewlett packard enterprises stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hewlett packard enterprises performance also may affect the price of hewlett packard enterprises stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service standard  poors ratings services and fitch ratings services despite these investment grade credit ratings any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts additionally increased borrowing costs including those arising from a credit rating downgrade can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

in addition to our current total carrying debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future this collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors including 



 to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks described above could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to service or refinance our debt 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

 these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hewlett packard enterprise as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hewlett packard enterprise could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hewlett packard enterprise stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hewlett packard enterprise stock 

risks related to the separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment 

the stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our former software segment could result in significant tax liability and dxc or micro focus as applicable may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us 

the completed separations of our former enterprise services business and our software segment were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of i the relevant distribution and related transactions as a “reorganization” within the meaning of sections 368a 361 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and ii the relevant merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a of the code while the software separation is generally expected to qualify for taxfree treatment for us seattle spinco and micro focus the acquisition of seattle spinco by micro focus is expected to result in the recognition of gain but not loss for us persons who receive micro focus american depositary shares in the software separation 

each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us everett spinco and csc or us seattle spinco and micro focus 

as applicable if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized notwithstanding the opinions of counsel the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position 

if the distribution of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who receive everett spinco shares or seattle spinco shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the completed separation of our former enterprise services business and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the conclusions of the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the irs private letter ruling may be affected notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former enterprise services business including nonus tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former enterprise services business in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material if the completed separation of our former enterprise services business or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the completed separation of our former enterprise services business are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor dxc could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we have applied for a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the software separation and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the conclusions of the irs private letter ruling will be based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete the validity of the irs private letter ruling may be affected if the completed separation of our former software segment or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the completed separation of our former software segment are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes or if we do not receive the private letter ruling concluding that the transactions are generally taxfree we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor micro focus could be subject to significant us federal income tax liabilities notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former software segment business including nonus tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former software segment business in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material 

under the tax matters agreements entered into by us with everett spinco and csc and with seattle spinco and micro focus everett spinco and seattle spinco generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by or acquisitions of capital stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable any such indemnity obligations could be material 

risks related to the prior separation from former parent 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes hewlett packard enterprise and those who received hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances hewlett packard enterprise could be required to indemnify hp inc for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

it was a condition to the distribution that our former parent receive i a private letter ruling from the us internal revenue service the irs andor one or more opinions from its external tax advisors regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and related transactions and ii opinions of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code these opinions of outside counsel or other external tax advisors 

and the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of hp co and hewlett packard enterprise including those relating to the past and future conduct of hp co and hewlett packard enterprise if in the future any of these facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if hp inc as successor to hp co or hewlett packard enterprise breach any of their respective covenants contained in any of the separationrelated agreements or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion may be rendered invalid accordingly notwithstanding hp cos receipt of the irs private letter ruling andor opinions of counsel or other external tax advisors the irs could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs private letter ruling or on which any opinion was based are false or have been violated in addition the irs private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes and an opinion of outside counsel or other external tax advisor represents the judgment of such counsel or advisor which is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly notwithstanding receipt by hp co of the irs private letter ruling and the tax opinions referred to above there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge hp inc hewlett packard enterprise and hp co stockholders who received hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions is found to no longer qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes hp inc would recognize taxable gain as if it has sold the hewlett packard enterprise common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and hp co stockholders who received shares of hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax matters agreement we entered into with hp inc in connection with the separation the tax matters agreement we are generally required to indemnify hp inc for any taxes resulting from the separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of hewlett packard enterprise whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii other actions or failures to act by hewlett packard enterprise or iii any of the representations or undertakings of hewlett packard enterprise contained in any of the separationrelated agreements or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion being incorrect or violated any such indemnity obligations could be material 

our historical financial information for periods prior to the separation is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical information about hewlett packard enterprise relating to fiscal years prior to 2016 in this form 10k refers to our business as formerly operated by and integrated with our former parent and does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company during the period presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors among others 



standalone company we may in the future need to obtain additional financing from banks through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities strategic relationships or other arrangements 

 other significant changes have occurred and may occur in our cost structure management financing and business operations as a result of operating as a separate company for additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated and combined financial statements of our business see consolidated and combined financial statements managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the historical consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the separation and distribution agreement that we entered into with our former parent may limit our ability to compete in certain markets and may impose limitations on our recruiting efforts for a period of time following the separation 

the separation and distribution agreement includes noncompete provisions pursuant to which we generally agree to not compete with hp inc in certain product and service categories that comprise the hp inc business including personal computers and printers worldwide for three years from the distribution date such restrictions are subject to certain exceptions set forth in the separation and distribution agreement these restrictions may limit our ability to compete in certain markets and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

hewlett packard enterprise or hp inc may fail to perform under the transition services agreement and other transaction agreements executed as part of the separation and we may not have necessary systems and services in place when these transaction agreements expire 

in connection with the separation hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc entered into several agreements including among others a transition services agreement the transition services agreement the separation and distribution agreement the tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement the employee matters agreement a real estate matters agreement the real estate matters agreement a commercial agreement the master commercial agreement and an it service agreement the information technology service agreement or the it service agreement the transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition period after the separation the separation and distribution agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the master commercial agreement establishes a bilateral relationship between hp inc and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal use incorporation and bundling in oem products and services resale to customers and use in the provision of managed services to customers as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities the it service agreement provides for the performance by one of our subsidiaries of certain application development and maintenance and it infrastructure services for hp inc we rely on hp inc to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if hp inc is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its obligations with respect to the provision of transition services we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

indemnification liabilities to hp inc pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the separation and distribution agreement provides for among other things indemnification obligations generally designed to make us financially responsible for i liabilities primarily associated with our business ii our failure to pay perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such liabilities or contracts in accordance with their respective terms whether prior to at or after the distribution iii any guarantee indemnification obligation surety bond or other credit support agreement arrangement commitment or understanding by hp inc for our benefit unless related to liabilities primarily associated with the hp inc business iv any breach by us of the separation agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any action by us in contravention of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws and v any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading with respect to all information contained in our registration statement on form 10 or any other disclosure document that describes the separation or the distribution or hewlett packard enterprise and its subsidiaries or primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by the separation and distribution agreement subject to certain exceptions if we are required to indemnify hp inc under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

in connection with the separation hp inc has indemnified us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that hp incs ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements we have entered into with hp inc hp inc has agreed to indemnify hewlett packard enterprise for certain liabilities however third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that hp inc has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from hp inc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that hp inc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition hp incs insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the separation moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from hp inc or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities as a result of our separation from our former parent 

as a result of the separation from our former parent there are several significant areas where the liabilities of our former parent have or may become our obligations for example under the code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the consolidated us federal income tax return group of our former parent during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the distribution is severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the consolidated us federal income tax return group of our former parent for that taxable period consequently if hp inc is unable to pay the consolidated us federal income tax liability for a preseparation period we could be required to pay the amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation and distribution our former parent undertook several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which along with the separation and distribution may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation and distribution any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation and distribution

with the completion of the everett and seattle transactions we have reclassified the historical financial results of our former enterprise services segment former es segment and our former software segment to net loss from discontinued operations in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings and to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets 

the following overview results of operations and liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015 unless otherwise noted the capital resources and contractual and other obligations discussions present information as of october 31 2017 unless otherwise noted 

  for purposes of this mda section we use the terms hewlett packard enterprise hpe the company we us and our to refer to hewlett packard enterprise company references in this mda section to former parent refer to hp inc 

 overview 

we are an industry leading technology company that enables customers to go further faster with a deep and comprehensive portfolio spanning the cloud to the data center to the intelligent edge our technology and services help customers around the world deliver business outcomes our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by william r hewlett and david packard and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers 

we organize our business into three segments for financial reporting purposes the enterprise group eg financial services fs and corporate investments the following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 





 net revenue decreased by 14 billion or 47 decreased 41 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the leading contributor to the net revenue decrease was a net revenue decline in eg due primarily to a decline in servers revenue as a result of lower revenue from tier1 server sales and a decline in networking revenue as a result of the divestiture of our controlling interest in the h3c technologies and chinabased server storage and technology services businesses h3c divestiture in may 2016 gross margin was 301 87 billion and 323 98 billion for fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively the 22 percentage point decrease in gross margin was due primarily to lower gross margins in eg as a 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

result of higher commodity costs particularly dynamic randomaccess memory dram and competitive pressures affecting servers and storage the impact of the h3c divestiture particularly in networking and unfavorable currency fluctuatio ns we continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting from increased commodity costs particularly dram and a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio operating margin decreased by 107 percentage points in fiscal 2017 due primarily to gains associated with the h3c and mphasis divestitures recorded in the prioryear period 

as of october 31 2017 cash and cash equivalents were approximately 96 billion representing a decrease of approximately 34 billion from the october 31 2016 balance of approximately 130 billion the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to the following debt payments of 38 billion share repurchases and cash dividend payments of 30 billion investments in property plant and equipment net of sales proceeds of 25 billion and payments made in connection with business acquisitions of 22 billion partially offset by cash dividends received from everett and seattle totaling 55 billion and proceeds from debt issuances of 23 billion 

trends and uncertainties 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges include dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the market shift of workloads to cloudrelated it infrastructure business models emergence of softwaredefined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality and growth in it consumption models certain of our legacy hardware businesses in eg face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products demand for core server products and traditional storage has weakened and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is impacting support attach opportunities in technology services ts within the eg segment 

another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others 

a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution 

to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model shifts and optimize gotomarket execution by improving cost structure aligning sales coverage with strategic goals improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking converged storage highperformance compute and wireless networking which will keep us aligned with market demand industry trends and the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we launched an initiative called hpe next through which we will architect a purposebuilt company designed to compete and win in the markets where we participate through this initiative we will simplify our operating model and the way we work we will streamline our offerings and business processes to improve our execution more importantly we will continue to shift our investments in innovation towards high growth and higher margin solutions and services this initiative includes consolidating our manufacturing and support services locations streamlining our business systems and reducing the number of countries in which we have a direct sales presence while simultaneously migrating to a channelonly model in the remaining countries for additional details on the hpe next initiative see note 5 hpe next to the consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

our consolidated and combined financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hpes board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements 

we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry lifecycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement 

we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from us and we have completed our obligations related to the sale 

for the various software products we sell we assess whether the software products were sold on a standalone basis or with hardware products if the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware product and is morethanincidental we treat it as a software deliverable 

we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements such as postcontract customer support exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on a whenandifavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered 

for saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance 

we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts including extended warranty contracts and software postcontract customer support agreements ratably over the contract period for certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made total project costs are regularly reassessed during the life of a fixedprice contract provisions for estimated losses on fixedprice contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

warranty 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from one to five years for parts and labor depending upon the product for certain networking products we offer a lifetime warranty over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately 19  of annual net product revenue 

restructuring 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease and contract cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 4 restructuring and note 5 hpe next to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 6 retirement and postretirement benefit plans to the consolidated and combined financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions of discount rates the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2017  



taxes on earnings 

for fiscal 2015 and prior current income tax liabilities related to entities which filed jointly with former parent are assumed to be immediately settled with former parent and are relieved through the former parent company investment account and the net transfers to former parent in the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows income tax expense and other income tax related information contained in our consolidated and combined financial statements are presented on a separate return basis as if we filed our own tax returns the separate return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if we were a separate taxpayer and a standalone enterprise for fiscal 2015 the calculation of our income taxes on a separate return basis required a considerable amount of judgment and use of both estimates and allocations as of november 1 2015 hewlett packard enterprise company was formally separated from former parent as such any current income tax liabilities generated by hewlett packard enterprise will be settled by hewlett packard enterprise and no longer included with tax filings of former parent 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we will adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future sources of taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided for us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the us we plan distributions of foreign 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the us and the amounts we expect to distribute to the us and provide for the us federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the us further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the us and our related future effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 120 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest as well as preseparation income tax liabilities of hp inc for which the company is jointly and severally liable for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 8 taxes on earnings to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product lifecycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues 

business combinations 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated and combined statement of earnings in the period it is abandoned the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test we perform a quantitative test for each of our reporting units as part of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level as of october 31 2017 our reporting units were consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 3 segment information to the consolidated and combined financial 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

statements in the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge 

estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows risk adjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly traded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is impaired the goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 32  for eg to approximately 37  for fs of the respective carrying amounts 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10  decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit based on the results of this hypothetical 10  decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying value 

intangible assets 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach 

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes at october 31 2017  the gross notional amount of our derivative portfolio was 283 billion  assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 260 million  and 477 million  respectively as of october 31 2017  

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation 

hewlett packard enterprise company and subsidiaries 

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations continued 

models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves company and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 13 fair value and note 14 financial instruments respectively to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters which arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in note 19 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated and combined financial statements are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2017  it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements 

accounting pronouncements 

for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated and combined financial statements see note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 of part ii which is incorporated herein by reference 

results of operations 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and doesnt adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of a current year revenue converted to us dollars using the prioryear periods foreign currency exchange rates divided by b prioryear period revenue this information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

eg net revenue decreased by 1568 million or 56 decreased 49 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2017 the decrease was due primarily to a decline in servers revenue as a result of a revenue decline of 1314 million from tier1 server sales and a decline in networking as a result of the h3c divestiture in may 2016 which contributed 809 million in eg net revenue in the prioryear period partially offset by a revenue contribution of approximately   640   million from the acquisitions of sgi and nimble storage during fiscal 2017   eg continues to experience revenue growth challenges due to market trends including the shift of workloads to cloud deployment models emergence of softwaredefined architectures growth in it consumption models and a highly competitive pricing environment

eg earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 25 percentage points in fiscal 2017 due to a decrease in gross margin and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the gross margin decrease was due primarily to higher commodity costs particularly dram and competitive pressures affecting servers and storage the impact of the h3c divestiture particularly in networking and unfavorable currency fluctuations which was partially offset by improved gross margin from a lower mix of tier1 server sales revenue lower variable compensation expense and a higher mix of revenue from aruba products operating expense as a percentage of net revenue increased due to the revenue decline notwithstanding the reduction in operating expense the decrease in operating expense was due primarily to cost reduction actions the impact of the h3c divestiture which represented 279 million of expense in the prior year and lower variable compensation expense which was partially offset by increased expenses as a result of our recently acquired businesses 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

eg net revenue decreased by 732 million or 26 flat on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2016 the decrease in eg net revenue was due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations led by the euro and the impact of the h3c divestiture which impacted each of the eg business units primarily networking and ts

the portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheets for fs were as follows 





 the decrease in financing receivables gross and the corresponding increase in net equipment under operating leases during the fiscal year ended october 31 2017 is due primarily to the conversion of capital leases to operating leases related to the everett transaction intercompany leases decreased during the fiscal year ended october 31 2017 as a result of the everett transaction as leasing transactions with the former es segment were treated as intercompany leases and eliminated in consolidation until the close of the transaction as of april 1 2017 these leases became third party leases held with dxc

corporate investments loss from operations decreased by 41 in fiscal 2017 and 11 in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prioryear periods respectively the decline in loss from operations for fiscal 2017 was due to lower expenses in hp labs and certain cloudrelated incubation activities as well as the absence of operating expenses related to mphasis the decline in loss from operations for fiscal 2016 was due primarily to lower expenses associated with cloudrelated incubation activities and hp labs 

liquidity and capital resources 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures acquisitions restructuring activities transformation costs remaining separation costs maturing debt interest payments income tax payments in addition to any future investments and any future share repurchases and future stockholder dividend payments we expect to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary by accessing the capital markets issuing commercial paper and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions however our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a each of which is incorporated herein by reference 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with a substantial amount held outside of the us we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position is strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

amounts held outside of the us are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to shortterm intercompany loans into the us most of the amounts held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us but under current law some would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years including potentially with respect to us tax reform where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the us and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations

our key working capital metrics were as follows 



days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal 2017 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in dso was due primarily to lower aged accounts receivables a reduction in accounts receivables of recent acquisitions and improvements in credit and collections for fiscal 2016 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in dso was due to favorable early payment linearity and strong credit and collections management 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2017 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dos was due primarily to higher inventory resulting from increases in memory component costs and an increase in inventory as a result of recent acquisitions for fiscal 2016 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in dos was due to lower inventory to support expected service levels including key commodity buffer management 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2017 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dpo was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers for fiscal 2016 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dpo was due primarily to an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers and favorable purchasing linearity 

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms including extended payment terms from suppliers the extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period and acquisition activity

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 60 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2017 were the euro japanese yen british pound and chinese yuan renminbi for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and from time to time options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales operating expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2017 and 2016 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2017 and 2016 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 39 million and 47 million at october 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing 

we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments by entering into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2017 and 2016 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2017 and 2016 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our 

debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 43 million and 39 million at october 31 2017 and 2016 respectively

broad and deep endtoend solutions portfolio we combine our technology infrastructure software and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the broadest and deepest portfolio of endtoend enterprise solutions in the it industry our ability to deliver a wide range of highquality products and highvalue consulting and support services in a single package is one of our principal differentiators

our strategies 

disruptive change is all around us and we are living in an idea economy where the ability to turn an idea into a new product or a new industry is more accessible than ever this environment requires a new style of business underpinned by a new style of it cloud mobile big data and analytics provide the tools enterprises need to significantly reduce the time to market for any good idea hewlett packard enterprises strategy is to enable customers to win in the idea economy by slashing the time it takes to turn an idea into value 

we make it environments more efficient more productive and more secure enabling fast flexible responses to a rapidly changing competitive landscape we enable organizations to act quickly on ideas by creating consuming and reconfiguring new solutions experiences and business models and deliver infrastructure that is built from components that can be composed and recomposed easily and quickly to meet the shifting demands of business applications 

every it journey is unique but every customer is looking to minimize the time between initial idea and realized value while some customers are looking for solutions that let them take the next step on this journey the majority of customers are at 

the beginning of this journey and are looking for solutions that can help them take their first steps hewlett packard enterprise will leverage our leadership position in our traditional markets to lead the transition to this new style of business 

specifically we are focused on delivering solutions to help customers transform four critical areas that matter most to their business 

transform to a hybrid infrastructure infrastructure matters more than ever today but customers need a new kind of infrastructure we help customers build an ondemand infrastructure and operational foundation for all of the applications that power the enterprise with our cloud expertise combined with our portfolio of traditional it infrastructure and services we are able to provide customized and seamless it solutions for customers of all sizes and at all levels of technological sophistication we are able to optimize our customers applications regardless of form—traditional mobile in the cloud or in the data center 

protect the digital enterprise the threat landscape is wider and more diverse today than ever before we offer complete risk management solutions ranging from protection against security threats to data backup and recovery that help our customers protect themselves and their data in an increasingly volatile cybersecurity landscape our products and services are informed by our decades of it security experience and enable customers to predict and disrupt threats manage risk and compliance and extend their internal security team 

empower the datadriven organization we provide opensource solutions that allow customers to use 100 of their data including business data human data and machine data to generate realtime actionable insights the result is better and faster decision making 

enable workplace productivity we help customers deliver rich digital and mobile experiences to their customers employees and partners we offer an endtoend mobility portfolio from cloud infrastructure to customerfacing applications our infrastructure offerings leverage our cloud and security expertise to provide the backbone for secure mobile networks our integrated software offerings leverage our application expertise to provide intuitive interfaces for endusers we also leverage our big data expertise to enable our customers to gain insight into the mobile user experience by monitoring and analyzing customer experience analytics 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups including business and public sector enterprises and purchases of our products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

 the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our business segments manages the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager generally from eg or es to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design the use of outsourced manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand in addition to our use of outsourced manufacturers we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for certain customized parts although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources or where our suppliers are geographically concentrated when necessary we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in note 2 segment information to the consolidated and combined financial statements approximately 61 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2016 came from outside the united states 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance —recent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance and —we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 12 financial instruments to our consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success our research and development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

hewlett packard labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments is responsible for our research and development efforts hewlett packard labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 23 billion in fiscal 2016 23 billion in fiscal 2015 and 22 billion in fiscal 2014 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products services and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

patents 

our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at present our worldwide patent portfolio includes approximately 12000 patents 

patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend and —our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

backlog 

we believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to our diverse product and service portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months see item 1a risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

competition 

we have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise it infrastructure products and solutions multivendor customer services and it management software and solutions we believe we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments nevertheless we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business we compete primarily on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our application software and it infrastructure offerings 

the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are relatively short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above among others in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

enterprise group eg operates in the highly competitive enterprise technology infrastructure market which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition our primary competitors include technology vendors such as dell technologies inc dell cisco systems inc cisco netapp inc lenovo group ltd international business machines corporation ibm huawei technologies co ltd amazoncom inc amazon oracle corporation oracle fujitsu limited fujitsu juniper networks inc inspur co ltd hitachi ltd extreme networks inc pure storage inc brocade communications systems inc vmware nutanix inc google inc and rackspace inc in certain regions we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or whitebox manufacturers our strategy is to deliver superior products highvalue technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure software and services capabilities our competitive advantages include our broad endtoend solutions portfolio supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem 

enterprise services es competes in the it services consulting and integration infrastructure technology outsourcing business process outsourcing and application services markets our primary competitors include ibm global services computer sciences corporation systems integration firms such as accenture plc and offshore companies such as fujitsu and indiabased competitors wipro limited infosys limited and tata consultancy services ltd we also compete with other traditional hardware providers which are increasingly offering services to support their products new players in emerging areas like cloud such as amazon and smaller local players many of our competitors offer a wide range of global services and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition es teams with many companies to offer services and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities our competitive advantages include our deep technology expertise especially in complex multicountry multivendor andor multilanguage environments our differentiated intellectual property our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global resources on platforms from sap ag sap oracle and microsoft among others 

software the markets in which our software segment operates are characterized by rapidly changing customer requirements and technologies we design and develop enterprise it management software in competition with ibm ca technologies inc vmware bmc software inc and others our applications testing and delivery management software competes with products from companies like ibm microsoft ca technologies and atlassian corporation plc our big data solutions compete with products from companies like adobe systems inc ibm dell open text corporation oracle and symantec corporation we also deliver enterprise securityrisk intelligence solutions that compete with products from dell ibm cisco and splunk inc our information governance offerings incorporating both structured and unstructured data compete with products from companies like veritas technologies and dell as customers are becoming increasingly comfortable with newer delivery mechanisms such as saas we are facing competition from smaller less traditional competitors particularly for customers with smaller it organizations our differentiation lies in the breadth and depth of our software and services portfolio our collaboration with eg and es to provide comprehensive it solutions and the scope of our market coverage 

financial services in our financing business our competitors are captive financing companies mainly ibm global financing as well as banks and other financial institutions we believe our competitive advantage over banks and other financial institutions in our financing business is our ability to deliver flexible investment solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments see risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products and in some cases laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances some of our products and services also are or may in the future be subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the 

chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use and their energy efficiency including requirements relating to climate change we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including servers and networking equipment financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations services and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change as these laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating hewlett packard enterprise and its common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the market shift to cloudrelated it infrastructure software and services and the growth in softwareasaservice saas business models certain of our legacy hardware businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products additionally our legacy software business derives a large portion of its revenues from upfront license sales some of which over time can be expected to shift to saas a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the united states central and eastern europe and russia and certain countries in asia we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given our large and diverse portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our application software and it infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better 

pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products in addition the performance of our business critical systems business unit has been affected by the decline in demand for unix servers and concerns about the development of new versions of software to support our itaniumbased products financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example the development of cloudbased solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of hardware software and services as we adapt to a new hybrid model of it delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for integrated it solutions to successfully execute this strategy we must continue to pivot toward the delivery of integrated it solutions and continue to invest and expand in cloud computing enterprise security big data applications and mobility any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

for example our success in our software segment is dependent on our ability to address the market shift to saas and other gotomarket execution challenges to be successful in addressing these challenges we must improve our gotomarket execution with multiple product delivery models which better address customer needs and achieve broader integration across our overall product portfolio as we work to capitalize on important market opportunities in cloud computing big data enterprise security applications and mobility improvements in saas delivery however do not guarantee that we will achieve increased revenue or profitability saas solutions often have lower margins than other software solutions throughout the subscription period and customers may elect to not renew their subscriptions upon expiration of their agreements with us 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer  

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory 

performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement moreover some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

recent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa region china and certain other highgrowth markets ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

sales outside the united states constituted approximately 61 of our net revenue in fiscal 2016 our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

 the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the fcpa although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency volatility also contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely 

affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results as a consolidated subsidiary of hp co our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses particularly our services businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period see also the risk factor below entitled we have limited history of operating as an independent company and we expect to incur increased administrative and other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independent public company our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with singlesource suppliers each of which is described below 



adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays 

 business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including the czech republic mexico china and singapore we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions for example in may 2015 we acquired aruba networks inc which provides nextgeneration network access solutions for mobile enterprise in may 2016 we completed the sale to tsinghua holdings co ltd tsinghua the asset management arm of tsinghua university in china of a 51 interest in our wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates h3c technologies and our chinabased server storage and technology services businesses for approximately 26 billion see also the risk factors below under the heading “risks related to the proposed separation of our enterprise services business and our software segment” 

risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 



 we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets for example for fiscal 2012 we recorded an 80 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill associated with our enterprise services reporting unit within our enterprise services segment in addition for fiscal 2012 we recorded an 88 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated with autonomy if there are future sustained decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 



 we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have announced restructuring plans including the 2012 plan and the 2015 plan each as defined below in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans including details regarding the 2012 plan and the 2015 plan see note 3 restructuring to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties for example many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement including patent infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hewlett packard enterprise and its customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

the allocation of intellectual property rights that was made between hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc as part of the separation of the two entities and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could in the future adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hp co allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively as a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hp inc could also adversely affect the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation hewlett packard enterprise no longer has ownership of intellectual property allocated to hp inc and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement and patent licensing our ability to sell our products or services and our competitive position in the industry 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our enterprise services business properly 

the success of our es segment is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances 

the pricing and other terms of some of our it service agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our it services business 

some of our it service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our it services business 

some of our it outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreedupon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing differs from our peer group 

outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could harm the financial performance of our it services business 

if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our financial performance could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies 

failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition our former parent has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our combined financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our combined financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition as discussed in note 17 litigation and contingencies to our consolidated and combined financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular if circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the united states future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results of operations as of october 31 2016 we had 262 billion of undistributed earnings from nonus operations indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states see note 6 taxes on earnings to our consolidated and combined financial statements the carrying value of our deferred tax assets which are 

predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performance 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened 

our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or it services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our outsourcing services business routinely processes stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of outsourcing services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

in addition our business is subject to laws addressing privacy and information security in particular we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment in our big data offerings as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings if we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with security we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty claims 

our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

hewlett packard enterprises stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

 general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hewlett packard enterprises performance also may affect the price of hewlett packard 

enterprises stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition as discussed in note 17 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated and combined financial statements we are involved in several securities class action litigation matters additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service standard  poors ratings services and fitch ratings services despite these investment grade credit ratings any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts additionally increased borrowing costs including those arising from a credit rating downgrade can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

in addition to our current total carrying debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future this collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors including 

 to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks described above could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to service or refinance our debt 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 



these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hewlett packard enterprise as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hewlett packard enterprise could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hewlett packard enterprise stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hewlett packard enterprise stock 

risks related to the proposed separation of our enterprise services business and our software segment 

each of the proposed separation of our enterprise services business and subsequent merger with csc and the proposed separation of our software segment and subsequent merger with micro focus may not be consummated as or when planned or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

the proposed separation of each of i our enterprise services business including the distribution of the shares of everett spinco inc the subsidiary to which the enterprise services business will be transferred or everett spinco common stock to our stockholders and subsequent merger of a whollyowned subsidiary of everett spinco with computer sciences corporation “csc and such transactions the “es separation” and ii our software segment including the distribution of the shares of seattle spinco inc the subsidiary to which the software segment will be transferred or seattle spinco common stock to our stockholders and subsequent merger of seattle spinco with a whollyowned subsidiary of micro focus international plc “micro focus” and such transactions the “software separation” may not be consummated as currently contemplated or at all or may encounter unanticipated delays or other roadblocks including delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals in addition either or both of the es separation and the software separation together the “business separations” could create unanticipated difficulties for our business including in our enterprise services business or relating to our software segment prior to their consummation planning and executing the proposed separation distribution and subsequent merger for each of the business separations will require significant time effort and expense and may divert the attention of our management and employees from other aspects of our business operations and any delays in the completion of either or both of the proposed business separations may increase the amount of time effort and expense that we devote to such transactions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete either or both of the business separations on the terms currently contemplated or at all disruptions in general market conditions or in the enterprise services business or with respect to our software segment could affect our ability to complete the business separations the proposed business separations are also subject to numerous closing conditions including among others approval of the issuance of the csc common stock by the requisite vote of csc’s stockholders in the case of the es separation and approval of the issuance of the micro focus ordinary shares by the requisite vote of micro focus’s shareholders in the case of the software separation the effectiveness of csc’s registration statement registering the csc common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement with csc in the case of the es separation and the effectiveness of micro focus’s registration statement registering the micro focus american depositary shares to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement with micro focus in the case of the software separation the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended the receipt of certain required foreign antitrust approvals and a cash dividend payment to us which is expected to be financed through borrowing in the case of each of the business separations 

in addition if we complete the proposed business separations there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the intended benefits of the transactions or that the combined company resulting from either of the business separations will perform as anticipated specifically the proposed business separations could cause disruptions in our remaining businesses the enterprise services business and csc’s business or seattle spinco and micro focus’s business including by disrupting operations or causing customers to delay or to defer decisions to purchase products renew contracts or to end their relationships similarly it is possible that current or prospective employees of or providing services to the enterprise services business csc the software segment or micro focus could experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined companies that will result from each separation as applicable which could harm the ability of the enterprise services business csc seattle spinco or micro focus to attract and retain key personnel any of the foregoing could adversely affect our remaining businesses following the completion of the business separations or the business financial condition or results of operations of csc or the enterprise services business or of micro focus or the software segment 

in addition csc and the enterprise services business or micro focus and the seattle spinco could face difficulties in integrating their businesses or csc or micro focus could face difficulties in its business generally as a result our stockholders may not receive benefits or value in excess of the benefits and value that might have been created or realized had we retained the enterprise services business or the software segment respectively 

the stock distribution in either or both of the business separations could result in significant tax liability and csc or micro focus as applicable may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us 

each of the business separations is conditioned on the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of i the relevant distribution and related transactions as a “reorganization” within the meaning of sections 368a 361 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the “code” and ii the relevant merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a of the code 

each opinion of outside counsel will be based upon and rely on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us everett spinco and csc or us seattle spinco and micro focus as applicable if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized notwithstanding the opinions of counsel the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position 

if the distribution of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who receive everett spinco shares or seattle spinco shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax matters agreement entered into by us with everett spinco and csc and to be entered into by us with seattle spinco and micro focus everett spinco and seattle spinco generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i certain actions taken by or acquisitions of capital stock of everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation or ii any breach of certain representations and covenants made by everett spinco or seattle spinco as applicable any such indemnity obligations could be material 

risks related to the prior separation from former parent 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes hewlett packard enterprise and those who received hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances hewlett packard enterprise could be required to indemnify hp inc for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

it was a condition to the distribution that our former parent receive i a private letter ruling from the us internal revenue service the irs andor one or more opinions from its external tax advisors regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and related transactions and ii opinions of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code these opinions of outside counsel or other external tax advisors and the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of hp co and hewlett packard enterprise including those relating to the past and future conduct of hp co and hewlett packard enterprise if in the future any of these facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if hp inc as successor to hp co or hewlett packard enterprise breach any of their respective covenants contained in any of the separationrelated agreements or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion may be rendered invalid accordingly notwithstanding hp cos receipt of the irs private letter ruling andor opinions of counsel or other external tax advisors the irs could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs private letter ruling or on which any opinion was based are false or have been violated in addition the irs private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes and an opinion of outside counsel or other external tax advisor represents the judgment of such counsel or advisor which is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly notwithstanding receipt by hp co of the irs private letter ruling and the tax opinions referred to above there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax 

purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge hp inc hewlett packard enterprise and hp co stockholders who received hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions is found to no longer qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes hp inc would recognize taxable gain as if it has sold the hewlett packard enterprise common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and hp co stockholders who received shares of hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax matters agreement we entered into with hp inc in connection with the separation the tax matters agreement we are generally required to indemnify hp inc for any taxes resulting from the separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of hewlett packard enterprise whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii other actions or failures to act by hewlett packard enterprise or iii any of the representations or undertakings of hewlett packard enterprise contained in any of the separationrelated agreements or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion being incorrect or violated any such indemnity obligations could be material 

in addition we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the separation including nonus tax costs resulting from separations in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capitalraising transactions following the separation 

to preserve the taxfree treatment of the separation and the distribution for us federal income tax purposes for the two year period following the separation we are prohibited under the tax matters agreement except in specific circumstances from i entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the shares of our common stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise ii issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds iii repurchasing shares of our common stock other than in certain openmarket transactions iv ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses or v taking or failing to take any other action that would prevent the distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code these restrictions may limit for a period of time our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions equity issuances or repurchases or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business 

we have limited history of operating as an independent company and we expect to incur increased administrative and other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independent public company our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical information about hewlett packard enterprise relating to fiscal years prior to fiscal 2016 in this form 10k refers to our business as formerly operated by and integrated with our former parent and does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors among others 



 other significant changes may occur in our cost structure management financing and business operations as a result of operating as a separate company for additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated and combined financial statements of our business see consolidated and combined financial statements managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the historical consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the separation and distribution agreement that we entered into with our former parent may limit our ability to compete in certain markets and may impose limitations on our recruiting efforts for a period of time following the separation 

the separation and distribution agreement includes noncompete provisions pursuant to which we generally agree to not compete with hp inc in certain product and service categories that comprise the hp inc business including personal computers and printers worldwide for three years from the distribution date such restrictions are subject to certain exceptions set forth in the separation and distribution agreement these restrictions may limit our ability to compete in certain markets and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

hewlett packard enterprise or hp inc may fail to perform under the transition services agreement and other transaction agreements executed as part of the separation and we may not have necessary systems and services in place when these transaction agreements expire 

in connection with the separation hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc entered into several agreements including among others a transition services agreement the transition services agreement the separation and distribution agreement the tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement the employee matters agreement a real estate matters agreement the real estate matters agreement a commercial agreement the master commercial agreement and an it service agreement the information technology service agreement or the it service agreement the transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition period after the separation the separation and distribution agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the master commercial agreement establishes a bilateral relationship between hp inc and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal use incorporation and bundling in oem products and services resale to customers and use in the provision of managed services to customers as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities the it service agreement provides for the performance by one of our subsidiaries of certain application development and maintenance and it infrastructure services for hp inc we rely on hp inc to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if hp inc is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its obligations with respect to the provision of transition services we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition if we do not have in place our own systems and services or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services in place once certain transition services expire we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline we are in the process of creating our own or engaging third parties to provide systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that hp inc provides to us under the transition services agreement however we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services or in transitioning from hp incs systems to our own systems and may pay more for such systems and services that we pay under the transition services agreement 

the separation may in the future result in disruptions to and negatively impact our relationships with our customers and other business partners in addition certain contracts that that needed to be assigned from hp inc or its affiliates to hewlett packard enterprise in connection with the separation and required the consent of the counterparty to such an assignment have not as yet and failure to obtain these consents could increase our expenses or otherwise harm our business and financial performance 

uncertainty related to the hewlett packard enterprises position postseparation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships or cause them to consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition the separation and distribution agreement provided for the assignment of a number of contracts from hp inc or its affiliates to us or our affiliates a minority of our customer contracts require the contractual counterpartys consent to assignment a small number of which remain outstanding postseparation if we are unable to obtain these consents we may be unable to obtain some of the benefits assets and contractual commitments that are intended to be allocated to us as part of the separation if we are unable to obtain these consents the loss of these contracts could increase our expenses or otherwise reduce our profitability 

indemnification liabilities to hp inc pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the separation and distribution agreement provides for among other things indemnification obligations generally designed to make us financially responsible for i liabilities primarily associated with our business ii our failure to pay perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such liabilities or contracts in accordance with their respective terms whether prior to at or after the distribution iii any guarantee indemnification obligation surety bond or other credit support agreement arrangement commitment or understanding by hp inc for our benefit unless related to liabilities primarily associated with the hp inc business iv any breach by us of the separation agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any action by us in contravention of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws and v any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading with respect to all information contained in our registration statement on form 10 or any other disclosure document that describes the separation or the distribution or hewlett packard enterprise and its subsidiaries or primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by the separation and distribution agreement subject to certain exceptions if we are required to indemnify hp inc under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

in connection with the separation hp inc has indemnified us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that hp incs ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements we have entered into with hp inc hp inc has agreed to indemnify hewlett packard enterprise for certain liabilities however third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that hp inc has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from hp inc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that hp inc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition hp incs insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the separation moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from hp inc or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities as a result of our separation from our former parent 

as a result of the separation from our former parent there are several significant areas where the liabilities of our former parent have or may become our obligations for example under the code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the consolidated us federal income tax return group of our former parent during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the distribution is severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the consolidated us federal income tax return group of our former parent for that taxable period consequently if hp inc is unable to pay the consolidated us federal income tax liability for a preseparation period we could be required to pay the amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation and distribution our former parent undertook several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which along with the separation and distribution may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation and distribution any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation and distribution

  for purposes of this mda section we use the terms hewlett packard enterprise hpe the company we us and our to refer to hewlett packard enterprise company references in this mda section to former parent refer to hp inc 

 overview 

we are an industry leading technology company that enables customers to go further faster with the industrys most comprehensive portfolio spanning the cloud to the data center to workplace applications our technology and services help customers around the world make information technology it more efficient more productive and more secure our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by william r hewlett and david packard and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers we are a global company with customers ranging from small and mediumsized businesses smbs to large global enterprises 

we organize our business into five segments for financial reporting purposes the enterprise group eg enterprise services es software financial services fs and corporate investments the following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 



 



 net revenue decreased 38 decreased 05 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 the leading contributors to the net revenue decrease were unfavorable currency fluctuations a net revenue decline in es due to weak demand across the europe middle east and africa emea region a net revenue decline in eg due to lower revenue from the technology services ts business unit and the impact of the h3c divestiture and lower software revenue due to divestitures and the transfer of a business to former parent at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 gross margin was 292 146 billion and 287 149 billion for fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively the 05 percentage point increase in gross margin was due primarily to service delivery efficiencies as a result of cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring programs in es partially offset by lower gross margin in software we continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting from a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio operating margin increased by 54 percentage points in fiscal 2016 due primarily to gains associated with the h3c and mphasis divestitures 

as of october 31 2016 cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments were approximately 130 billion representing an increase of approximately 29 billion from the october 31 2015 balance of approximately 101 billion the increase in cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments was due primarily to the following factors cash received from operating cash flows of 50 billion net proceeds from business divestitures of 33 billion and a final cash allocation of 05 billion from former parent partially offset primarily by investments in property plant and equipment net of sales proceeds of 28 billion cash utilization for share repurchases of 27 billion and cash dividend payments of 04 billion 

trends and uncertainties 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the market shift to cloudrelated it infrastructure software and services and the growth in softwareasaservice saas business models certain of our legacy hardware businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products additionally our legacy software business derives a large portion of its revenues from upfront license sales some of which over time can be expected to shift to saas another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution 

the macroeconomic weakness we have experienced has moderated in some geographic regions but remains an overall challenge a discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is set forth below 



portfolio as we work to capitalize on important market opportunities in cloud big data and security on september 7 2016 we announced plans for a spinoff and merger of our software segment with micro focus international plc for further details see item 1 business which is incorporated herein by reference

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

the consolidated and combined financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hpes board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance 

we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements 

we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 

we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal 

factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement 

we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive 

for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from the company and the company has completed its obligations related to the sale 

for the various software products we sell eg big data analytics and applications application testing and delivery management enterprise security and it operations management we assess whether the software products were sold on a standalone basis or with hardware products if the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware product and is morethan incidental we treat it as a software deliverable 

we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements such as postcontract customer support exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on a whenandifavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered 

for hosting or saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance in hosting arrangements we consider the rights provided to the customer eg whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and the feasibility of the customer to operate or contract with another vendor to operate the software in determining whether the arrangement includes the sale of a software license in hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts including extended warranty contracts and software postcontract customer support agreements ratably over the contract period for certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made on fixedprice contracts for design and build projects to design develop and construct software infrastructure and systems we recognize revenue as work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project total project costs are regularly reassessed during the life of a fixedprice contract provisions for estimated losses on fixedprice contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 

outsourcing services revenue is generally recognized in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event we recognize revenue using an objective measure of output for per unitpriced contracts revenue for fixedprice outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straightline basis if the service is provided evenly over the contract term provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable and are recorded as a component of cost of sales 

warranty 

we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from one to five years for parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately 21  of annual net product revenue 

restructuring 

we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 3 restructuring to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

retirement and postretirement benefits 

our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures 

our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 retirement and postretirement benefit plans to the consolidated and combined financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions of discount rates the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2016  



taxes on earnings 

for fiscal 2015 and prior current income tax liabilities related to entities which filed jointly with former parent are assumed to be immediately settled with former parent and are relieved through the former parent company investment account and the net transfers to former parent in the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows income tax expense and other income tax related information contained in our consolidated and combined financial statements are presented on a separate return basis as if we filed our own tax returns the separate return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if we were a separate taxpayer and a standalone enterprise for the periods presented the calculation of our income taxes on a separate return basis required a considerable amount of judgment and use 

of both estimates and allocations as of november 1 2015 hewlett packard enterprise company was formally separated from former parent as such any current income tax liabilities generated by hewlett packard enterprise will be settled by hewlett packard enterprise and no longer included with tax filings of former parent 

as of november 1 2015 we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we will adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future sources of taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided for us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the us we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the us and the amounts we expect to distribute to the us and provide for the us federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the us further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the us and our related future effective tax rate 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 110 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest as well as preseparation income tax liabilities of hp inc for which the company is joint and severally liable for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 taxes on earnings to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

inventory 

we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product lifecycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprd liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date iprd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated and combined statement of earnings in the period it is abandoned the excess of 

the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill 

when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we perform a quantitative test for each of our reporting units as part of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level as of october 31 2016 our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 2 segment information to the consolidated and combined financial statements in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge for the software and enterprise services es reporting units the company primarily utilized their respective spinoff and merger transaction values to estimate fair value 

estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows risk adjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly traded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit 

if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from 13  to approximately 154  of carrying amounts the software reporting unit has the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 13  

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10  decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit based on the results of this hypothetical 10  decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above the fair value of the software reporting unit was estimated using the amount the seattle transaction is expected to deliver to our shareholders on an aftertax basis a significant and sustained decline in the micro focus stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge 

intangible assets 

we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach 

equity method investments 

investments and ownership interests are accounted for under equity method accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest we record our interest in the net earnings of equity method investees based on the most recently available financial statements of the investees along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intraentity transactions and amortization of basis differences within loss from equity interests profits or losses related to intraentity sales with our equity method investees are eliminated until realized by us or investee basis differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them 

the carrying amount of the investment in equity interests is adjusted to reflect our interest in net earnings dividends received and otherthantemporary impairments we review for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable in such a case the decrease in value is recognized and charged to earnings in the period the impairment occurs 

fair value of derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes at october 31 2016  the gross notional amount of our derivative portfolio was 353 billion  assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 769 million  and 228 million  respectively as of october 31 2016  

fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves company and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices 

for a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 11 fair value and note 12 financial instruments respectively to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters which arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in note 17 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated and combined financial statements are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate 

provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2016  it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements

results of operations 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our revenue growth has been impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we present the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and doesnt adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends this constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the yearoveryear percentage change in revenue on a gaap basis other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes

software 



fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

software net revenue decreased 118 decreased 93 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2016 revenue growth in software is being challenged by the overall market shift to saas solutions and gotomarket sales execution challenges we are addressing as we respond to the market shift additionally as we transform our gotomarket approach the market shift to saas solutions is impacting growth in license and support revenue in fiscal 2016 net revenue growth was also negatively impacted by a combination of factors led by the transfer of the marketing optimization product group to former parent which was effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 business divestitures and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations across all regions led primarily by weakness in the euro as a result in fiscal 2016 net revenue from licenses support professional services and saas decreased by 12 14 6 and 7 respectively 

the decrease in license revenue was due primarily to the market shift to saas solutions and related sales execution challenges and as a result we experienced lower revenue in it operations management and enterprise security products the decrease in license revenue was also attributable to the transfer of the marketing optimization product group to former parent and the divestiture of the tippingpoint business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 the decrease in support revenue was due primarily to the transfer of the marketing optimization product group to former parent the divestiture of the tippingpoint business the impact of unfavorable currency fluctuations led primarily by weakness in the euro and the decline in license revenue which has a carry over impact to growth rates in support revenue professional services net revenue decreased due primarily to the transfer of the marketing optimization product group to former parent and the impact of unfavorable currency fluctuations saas net revenue decreased due primarily to the divestiture of the livevault business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 partially offset by growth in the it operations management portfolio

corporate investments loss from operations decreased by 18 for fiscal 2016 and increased by 73 for fiscal 2015 as compared to the prior year periods the decline in loss from operations for fiscal 2016 was due to lower spending on certain cloudrelated incubation activities and lower expenses in hp labs the increase in loss from operations for fiscal 2015 was due primarily to higher expenses associated with cloudrelated incubation activities and hp labs 

liquidity and capital resources 

we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity we believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses capital expenditures restructuring activities remaining separation costs divestiture transactions maturing debt interest payments income tax payments and the payment of future stockholder dividends in addition to any future investments and any future share repurchases we expect to supplement this shortterm liquidity if necessary by accessing the capital markets and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions however our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business market and economic conditions for example under the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the separation we will generally be prohibited except in specific circumstances from issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds for a two year period following the separation our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled risk factors in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a each of which is incorporated herein by reference 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with a substantial amount held outside of the us we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed our cash position is strong and we expect that our cash balances anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected nearterm cash outlays 

amounts held outside of the us are generally utilized to support nonus liquidity needs although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to shortterm intercompany loans into the us most of the amounts held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us but under current law some would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us we have provided for the us federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the us and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

on october 13 2015 our board of directors authorized a 30 billion share repurchase program on may 24 2016 the board of directors authorized an additional 30 billion under the share repurchase program the number of shares that we repurchase under the share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including share price liquidity and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion additionally our share repurchase activity if any during any particular period may fluctuate we may commence accelerate suspend delay or discontinue any share repurchase activity at any time without notice these programs do not have a specific expiration date 

in fiscal 2016 we repurchased an aggregate of 27 billion as a result of our share repurchase program the aggregate amount includes 25 billion repurchased under accelerated share repurchase agreements asr agreements with financial institutions with the remainder being open market repurchases for more information on our asr agreements refer to note 15 stockholders equity to the consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 

in december 2015 in connection with the separation and distribution agreement we received a final cash allocation of approximately 526 million from former parent the cash allocation was based on our projected cash requirements in light of the intended investment grade credit rating business plan and anticipated operations and activities 

in fiscal 2016 we completed a total of five divestitures resulting in 34 billion of net proceeds of which 25 million represents a deposit that was received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the proceeds from the divestitures primarily consisted of the sale of our controlling interest in h3c and the sale of mphasis 

our joint partnership agreement with tsinghua holdings to create a chinese provider of technology infrastructure h3c was executed in may 2016 for 26 billion in net proceeds under the definitive agreement tsinghua holdings subsidiary unisplendour corporation purchased 51 of the new business named h3c which is comprised of our former h3c technologies and chinabased server storage and technology services businesses the sale of our full equity stake in mphasis an it services provider headquartered in bangalore india to the blackstone group was completed in september 2016 and resulted in net proceeds of 06 billion 

on may 24 2016 we announced plans for a taxfree spinoff and merger of our enterprise services business with csc which will create a pureplay global it services company the transaction which is currently targeted to be completed on or 

around april 1 2017 is expected to deliver as of the announcement date approximately 85 billion to the shareholders of hewlett packard enterprise on an aftertax basis this amount includes an equity stake for hewlett packard enterprise shareholders in the new combined company valued at approximately 45 billion which represents approximately 501 ownership a cash dividend payment of 15 billion to hewlett packard enterprise and the assumption of 25 billion of hewlett packard enterprise net debt and other liabilities preceding the close of the transaction we expect to incur onetime costs of approximately 900 million to separate the enterprise services business from hewlett packard enterprise the majority of these costs will be offset by lower costs associated with our fiscal 2015 restructuring plan 

in association with our plan for a taxfree spinoff and merger of our enterprise services business with csc there will be a transfer of unfunded pension liabilities for certain pension plans to our enterprise services business as of october 31 2016 the transfer is targeted to be completed on or around april 1 2017 the approximate net pension liability to be transferred is pursuant to the transaction agreements wherein we are expected to fund the transferred net pension liability in excess of 570 million we currently estimate the total funding amount to be in the range of 20 billion to 30 billion while the exact amount will not be known until the transaction completion date in december 2016 we made initial funding payments of 19 billion 

on september 7 2016 we announced plans for a spinoff and merger of our software segment with micro focus which will create a pureplay enterprise software company upon the completion of the transaction which is currently anticipated to close by approximately august 31 2017 the transaction is expected to deliver as of the announcement date approximately 88 billion to the shareholders of hewlett packard enterprise on an aftertax basis this includes an equity stake for hewlett packard enterprise shareholders in the new combined company valued at approximately 63 billion which represents approximately 501 ownership and a cash dividend payment of 25 billion to hewlett packard enterprise preceding the close of the transaction we expect to incur onetime costs of approximately 700 million to separate the software segment from hewlett packard enterprise 

liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents total debt and available borrowing resources were as follows 



our key cash flow metrics were as follows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 13 billion for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due primarily to the impact of a 17 day improvement in the cash conversion cycle as compared to a four day cash conversion cycle improvement in fiscal 2015 and lower separation payments in the current fiscal period net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 33 billion for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to the impact of a four day reduction in the cash conversion cycle in fiscal 2015 as compared to a 13 day reduction in the cash conversion cycle in fiscal 2014 

our key working capital metrics were as follows 



days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts by a 90day average of net revenue for fiscal 2016 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in dso was due to favorable early payment linearity and strong credit and collections management for fiscal 2015 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dso was due to unfavorable payment linearity and longer standard payment terms for aruba 

days of supply in inventory dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2016 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in dos was due to lower inventory to support expected service levels including key commodity buffer management for fiscal 2015 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dos was due to higher inventory to support service levels 

days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average of cost of goods sold for fiscal 2016 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dpo was due primarily to an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers and favorable purchasing linearity for fiscal 2015 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in dpo was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our suppliers 

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include but are not limited to changes in business mix changes in payment terms the extent of receivables factoring seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period 

investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 04 billion in fiscal 2016 due primarily to net proceeds of 33 billion from business divestitures partially offset by 28 billion of investments in property plant and equipment net of proceeds from sales net cash used in investing activities increased by 24 billion in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to the acquisition of aruba 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 22 billion in fiscal 2016 due primarily to cash utilization for repurchases of common stock and dividend payments cash flow from financing activities for fiscal 2015 and 2014 primarily represents net transfers from to former parent and net payments on debt as cash and the financing of our operations during those periods have historically been managed by former parent the components of net transfers from to former parent include cash transfers from us to former parent and payments by former parent to settle our obligations these transactions are considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction is recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 70 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2016 were the euro british pound chinese yuan renminbi and japanese yen for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and from time to time options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales operating expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2016 and 2015 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2016 and 2015 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 47 million and 21 million at october 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing 

we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments by entering into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2016 and 2015 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2016 and 2015 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our 

debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 39 million and 52 million at october 31 2016 and 2015 respectively

transform to a hybrid infrastructure infrastructure matters more than ever today but customers need a new kind of infrastructure we help customers build an ondemand infrastructure and operational foundation for all of the applications that power the enterprise with our cloud expertise combined with our portfolio of traditional it infrastructure and services we are able to provide customized and seamless it solutions for customers of all sizes and at all levels of technological sophistication we are able to optimize our customers applications regardless of form—traditional mobile in the cloud or in the data center 

protect the digital enterprise the threat landscape is wider and more diverse today than ever before we offer complete risk management solutions ranging from protection against security threats to data backup and recovery that help our customers protect themselves and their data in an increasingly volatile cybersecurity landscape our products and services are informed by our decades of it security experience and enable customers to predict and disrupt threats manage risk and compliance and extend their internal security team 

empower the datadriven organization we provide opensource solutions that allow customers to use 100 of their data including business data human data and machine data to generate realtime actionable insights the result is better and faster decision making 

enable workplace productivity we help customers deliver rich digital and mobile experiences to their customers employees and partners we offer an endtoend mobility portfolio from cloud infrastructure to customerfacing applications our infrastructure offerings leverage our cloud and security expertise to provide the backbone for secure mobile networks our integrated software offerings leverage our application expertise to provide intuitive interfaces for endusers we also leverage our big data expertise to enable our customers to gain insight into the mobile user experience by monitoring and analyzing customer experience analytics 

sales marketing and distribution 

we manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups including business and public sector enterprises and purchases of our products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners including 

• resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups • distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers • oems that integrate our products and services with their own products and services and sell the integrated solution • independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products • systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and • advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our business segments manages the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager generally from eg or es to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate 

manufacturing and materials 

we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design the use of outsourced manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand in addition to our use of outsourced manufacturers we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors 

we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers 

we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for certain customized parts although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors 

like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources or where our suppliers are geographically concentrated when necessary we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factors—we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

international 

our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth 

a summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in note 2 segment information to the combined and consolidated financial statements approximately 61 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2015 came from outside the united states 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations see risk factors—due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance —recent global regional and local economic weakness and 

uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance —we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 12 financial instruments to our combined and consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference 

research and development 

innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success our research and development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences 

hewlett packard labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments is responsible for our research and development efforts hewlett packard labs is part of our corporate investments segment 

expenditures for research and development were 23 billion in fiscal 2015 22 billion in fiscal 2014 and 20 billion in fiscal 2013 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products services and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factors—if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

patents 

our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at present our worldwide patent portfolio includes approximately 15000 patents including approximately 2500 patents attributable to h3c 

patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments 

in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties 

for a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights see risk factors—our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend and —our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

backlog 

we believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to our diverse product and service portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 

seasonality 

general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months see risk factors—our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

competition 

we have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise it infrastructure products and solutions multivendor customer services and it management software and solutions we believe we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments nevertheless we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business we compete primarily on the basis of technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our application software and it infrastructure offerings 

the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are relatively short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above among others in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive 

the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 

enterprise group eg operates in the highly competitive enterprise technology infrastructure market which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition our primary competitors include technology vendors such as international business machines corporation ibm dell inc dell emc corporation emc cisco systems inc cisco lenovo group ltd oracle corporation oracle fujitsu limited fujitsu inspur co ltd huawei technologies co ltd netapp inc hitachi ltd juniper networks inc arista networks inc extreme networks inc brocade communications systems inc vmware microsoft google inc rackspace inc and amazoncom inc amazon in certain regions we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or whitebox manufacturers our strategy is to deliver superior products highvalue technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure software and services capabilities our competitive advantages include our broad endtoend solutions portfolio supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem 

enterprise services es competes in the it services consulting and integration infrastructure technology outsourcing business process outsourcing and application services markets our primary competitors include ibm global services computer sciences corporation systems integration firms such as accenture plc and offshore companies such as fujitsu and indiabased competitors wipro limited infosys limited and tata consultancy services ltd we also compete with other traditional hardware providers such as dell which are increasingly offering services to support their products new players in emerging areas like cloud such as amazon and smaller local players many of our competitors offer a wide range of global services and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand 

recognition es teams with many companies to offer services and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities our competitive advantages include our deep technology expertise especially in complex multicountry multivendor andor multilanguage environments our differentiated intellectual property our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global resources on platforms from sap ag sap oracle and microsoft among others 

software the markets in which our software segment operates are characterized by rapidly changing customer requirements and technologies we design and develop enterprise it management software in competition with ibm ca technologies inc vmware bmc software inc and others our big data solutions which include data analytics and information governance offerings incorporating both structured and unstructured data compete with products from companies like adobe systems inc ibm emc open text corporation oracle and symantec corporation we also deliver enterprise securityrisk intelligence solutions that compete with products from emc ibm cisco and intel as customers are becoming increasingly comfortable with newer delivery mechanisms such as saas we are facing competition from smaller less traditional competitors particularly for customers with smaller it organizations our differentiation lies in the breadth and depth of our software and services portfolio our collaboration with eg and es to provide comprehensive it solutions and the scope of our market coverage 

hewlett packard financial services in our financing business our competitors are captive financing companies mainly ibm global financing as well as banks and other financial institutions we believe our competitive advantage over banks and other financial institutions in our financing business is our ability to deliver flexible investment solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs 

for a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments see risk factors—we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

environment 

our operations are subject to regulation under various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 

many of our products are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use including laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products and in some cases laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances some of our products and services also are or may in the future be subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption in addition we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use and their energy efficiency including requirements relating to climate change we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including servers and networking equipment financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines 

our operations services and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change as these laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements and we are collaborating with industry and business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws regulations and treaties 

we are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business we meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental health and safety policy strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services 

environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations cash flows or financial position although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations cash flows or financial condition we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 

employees 

we had approximately 240000 employees as of october 31 2015

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form 10k in evaluating hewlett packard enterprise and its common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k 

risks related to our business 

if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited 

we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the market shift to cloudrelated it infrastructure software and services and the growth in softwareasaservice saas business models certain of our legacy hardware businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products additionally our legacy software business derives a large portion of its revenues from upfront license sales some of which over time can be expected to shift to saas a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the united states central and eastern europe and russia and certain countries in asia we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given our large and diverse portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security and the availability of our application software and it infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed 

we have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers 

companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures 

because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects 

even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products in addition the performance of our business critical systems business unit has been affected by the decline in demand for unix servers and concerns about the development of new versions of software to support our itaniumbased products financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example the development of cloudbased solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products 

if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer 

our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of hardware software and services as we adapt to a new hybrid model of it delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for integrated it solutions to successfully execute this strategy we must continue to pivot toward the delivery of integrated it solutions and continue to invest and expand in cloud computing enterprise security big data applications and mobility any 

failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel 

after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position 

for example our success in our software segment is dependent on our ability to address the market shift to saas and other gotomarket execution challenges to be successful in addressing these challenges we must improve our gotomarket execution with multiple product delivery models which better address customer needs and achieve broader integration across our overall product portfolio as we work to capitalize on important market opportunities in cloud computing big data enterprise security applications and mobility improvements in saas delivery however do not guarantee that we will achieve increased revenue or profitability saas solutions often have lower margins than other software solutions throughout the subscription period and customers may elect to not renew their subscriptions upon expiration of their agreements with us 

if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer  

in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other 

costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations 

if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement moreover some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken 

our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively 

recent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa region china and certain other highgrowth markets ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products services and solutions from 

organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses 

economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance 

sales outside the united states constituted approximately 61 of our net revenue in fiscal 2015 our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including 

• ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts • longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers • trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors • local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and original equipment manufacturers oems • managing our geographically dispersed workforce • changes in the international national or local regulatory and legal environments • differing technology standards or customer requirements • import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions • difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and • fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments 20 

the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the fcpa although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency volatility also contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 

from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition 

the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable 

our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results as a consolidated subsidiary of hp co our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses particularly our services businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business 

units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period see also the risk factor below entitled we have no history of operating as an independent company and we expect to incur increased administrative and other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independent public company our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly 

our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resourceintensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with singlesource suppliers each of which is described below 

• component shortages we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also our customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays • excess supply in order to secure components for our products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to 22 

anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

• contractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition • contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws • singlesource suppliers we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of a singlesource supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a singlesource supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a singlesource supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including the czech 

republic mexico china and singapore we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain 

our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable 

in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 

we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 

any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions for example in may 2015 we acquired aruba networks inc which provides nextgeneration network access solutions for mobile enterprise also in may 2015 we announced a partnership with tsinghua holdings co ltd tsinghua the asset management arm of tsinghua university in china pursuant to which we will sell to tsinghua a 51 interest in our wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates h3c technologies and our chinabased server storage and technology services businesses for approximately 23 billion subject to the terms and conditions of the share purchase agreement among tsinghua tsinghuas subsidiary unispendour corporation and our subsidiary h3c holdings limited the transaction with tsinghua is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions 

risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results 

• managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations • we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers other third parties or market trends • certain previous business combination and investment transactions have resulted and in the future any such transactions by us may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans • any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable • our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives • our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired companys product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal control deficiencies • the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated • in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders • we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition • our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate • an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter • business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation which could impact our financial condition and results of operations • if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage 25 

we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets for example for fiscal 2012 we recorded an 80 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill associated with our enterprise services reporting unit within our enterprise services segment in addition for fiscal 2012 we recorded an 88 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated with autonomy if there are future sustained decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects 

in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include 

• successfully combining product and service offerings including under the single new hewlett packard enterprise brand and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise • convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish customer service standards or business focus • persuading customers and distributors to not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts • consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes • minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns 26 

• persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs • coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures • achieving savings from supply chain integration and • managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business 

we have announced restructuring plans including the 2012 plan and the 2015 plan each as defined below in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plans including details regarding the 2012 plan and the 2015 plan see note 3 restructuring to the combined and consolidated financial statements 

our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend 

we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position 

our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties 

much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties for example many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes 

with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights 

thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement including patent infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services 

third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hewlett packard enterprise and its customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us 

the allocation of intellectual property rights that was made between hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc as part of the separation of the two entities and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could in the future adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position 

in connection with the separation hp co allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively as a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hp inc could also adversely affect the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation hewlett packard enterprise no longer has ownership of intellectual property allocated to hp inc and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to 

patent enforcement and patent licensing our ability to sell our products or services and our competitive position in the industry 

our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our enterprise services business properly 

the success of our es segment is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances 

the pricing and other terms of some of our it service agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our it services business 

some of our it service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our it services business 

some of our it outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreedupon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing differs from our peer group outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could harm the financial performance of our it services business 

if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our financial performance could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with 

certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies 

failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition our former parent has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our combined financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations 

in connection with the preparation of our combined financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition as discussed in note 17 litigation and contingencies to our combined and consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular if circumstances 

change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the united states future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results of operations as of october 31 2015 we had 276 billion of undistributed earnings from nonus operations indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states see note 6 taxes on earnings to our combined and consolidated financial statements the carrying value of our deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performance 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us 

in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened 

our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or it services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our outsourcing services business routinely processes stores and transmits 

large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of outsourcing services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 

terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars 

our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include 

restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict 

in addition our business is subject to laws addressing privacy and information security in particular we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment in our big data offerings as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings if we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with security we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions and thirdparty claims 

our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict 

hewlett packard enterprises stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are 

• speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of costcutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions future stock price performance board of directors executive team our competitors or our industry in general • the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by hewlett packard enterprise or its competitors • quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flows changes in estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by hewlett packard enterprise and variations between actual and estimated financial results • announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by hewlett packard enterprises competitors and other companies in the it industry • developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes and • the timing and amount of share repurchases by hewlett packard enterprise general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hewlett packard enterprises performance also may affect the price of hewlett packard enterprises stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition as discussed in note 17 litigation and contingencies to the combined and consolidated financial statements we are involved in several securities class action litigation matters additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service standard  poors ratings services and fitch ratings services despite these investment grade credit ratings any 

future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts additionally increased borrowing costs including those arising from a credit rating downgrade can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends 

in addition to our current total carrying debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future this collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors including 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments • making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations • increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing • increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions • reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business • limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry and • limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks described above could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to service or refinance our debt 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hewlett packard enterprise deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions 

• authorizing blank check preferred stock which we could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock • limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers • specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings 34 

• requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and • controlling the procedures for conduct of our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of our directors these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hewlett packard enterprise as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hewlett packard enterprise could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hewlett packard enterprise stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hewlett packard enterprise stock 

risks related to the separation 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes hewlett packard enterprise and those who received hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances hewlett packard enterprise could be required to indemnify hp inc for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

it was a condition to the distribution that our former parent receive i a private letter ruling from the us internal revenue service the irs andor one or more opinions from its external tax advisors regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and related transactions and ii opinions of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code these opinions of outside counsel or other external tax advisors and the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of hp co and hewlett packard enterprise including those relating to the past and future conduct of hp co and hewlett packard enterprise if in the future any of these facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if hp inc as successor to hp co or hewlett packard enterprise breach any of their respective covenants contained in any of the separationrelated agreements or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion may be rendered invalid accordingly notwithstanding hp cos receipt of the irs private letter ruling andor opinions of counsel or other external tax advisors the irs could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs private letter ruling or on which any opinion was based are false or have been violated in addition the irs private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes and an opinion of outside counsel or other external tax advisor represents the judgment of such counsel or advisor which is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly notwithstanding receipt by hp co of the irs private letter ruling and the tax opinions referred to above there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the 

irs were to prevail with such challenge hp inc hewlett packard enterprise and hp co stockholders who received hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions is found to no longer qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes hp inc would recognize taxable gain as if it has sold the hewlett packard enterprise common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and hp co stockholders who received shares of hewlett packard enterprise common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax matters agreement we entered into with hp inc in connection with the separation the tax matters agreement we are generally required to indemnify hp inc for any taxes resulting from the separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of hewlett packard enterprise whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii other actions or failures to act by hewlett packard enterprise or iii any of the representations or undertakings of hewlett packard enterprise contained in any of the separationrelated agreements or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor any tax opinion being incorrect or violated any such indemnity obligations could be material 

in addition we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the separation including nonus tax costs resulting from separations in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capitalraising transactions following the separation 

to preserve the taxfree treatment of the separation and the distribution for us federal income tax purposes for the twoyear period following the separation we are prohibited under the tax matters agreement except in specific circumstances from i entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the shares of our common stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise ii issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds iii repurchasing shares of our common stock other than in certain openmarket transactions iv ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses or v taking or failing to take any other action that would prevent the distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code these restrictions may limit for a period of time our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions equity issuances or repurchases or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business 

we have no history of operating as an independent company and we expect to incur increased administrative and other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independent public company our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical information about hewlett packard enterprise in this form 10k refers to our business as formerly operated by and integrated with our former parent our fourth quarter and fiscal year financial information included in this form 10k does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors among others 

• prior to the separation our business was operated by our former parent as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company our former parent or one of its 36 

affiliates performed various corporate functions for us such as legal treasury accounting internal auditing human resources and corporate affairs and also provided our it and other corporate infrastructure our financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from our former parent for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company now that the separation is complete our costs related to such functions previously performed by hp co may increase 

• historically when we were integrated with the other businesses of our former parent we shared economies of scope and scale in costs employees vendor relationships and customer relationships although we have entered into certain agreements including a transition services agreement with hp inc in connection with the separation these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits that we enjoyed as a result of being integrated with our former parent and may result in us paying higher charges than in the past for these services this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in future periods • generally our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures have historically been satisfied as part of the corporatewide cash management policies of our former parent in connection with the separation we have entered into certain financing arrangements described under the section entitled description of material indebtedness as part of our transition to becoming a standalone company we may in the future need to obtain additional financing from banks through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities strategic relationships or other arrangements • the cost of capital for our business may be higher than our former parents cost of capital prior to the separation other significant changes may occur in our cost structure management financing and business operations as a result of operating as a separate company for additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical combined and consolidated financial statements of our business see combined and consolidated financial statements managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the historical combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the separation and distribution agreement that we entered into with our former parent may limit our ability to compete in certain markets and may impose limitations on our recruiting efforts for a period of time following the separation 

the separation and distribution agreement includes noncompete provisions pursuant to which we generally agree to not compete with hp inc in certain product and service categories that comprise the hp inc business including personal computers and printers worldwide for three years from the distribution date such restrictions are subject to certain exceptions set forth in the separation and distribution agreement 

in addition the separation and distribution agreement contains i nonsolicitation provisions preventing us from soliciting hp inc employees to work for us for twelve months from the distribution date and ii nohire provisions preventing us from hiring hp inc employees for six months from the distribution date in each case subject to certain exceptions 

the foregoing restrictions may limit our ability to compete in certain markets and may impose limitations on our recruiting efforts these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

hewlett packard enterprise or hp inc may fail to perform under the transition services agreement and other transaction agreements executed as part of the separation and we may not have necessary systems and services in place when these transaction agreements expire 

in connection with the separation hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc entered into several agreements including among others a transition services agreement the transition services agreement the separation and distribution agreement the tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement the employee matters agreement a real estate matters agreement the real estate matters agreement a commercial agreement the master commercial agreement and an it service agreement the information technology service agreement or the it service agreement the transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition period after the separation the separation and distribution agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the master commercial agreement establishes a bilateral relationship between hp inc and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal use incorporation and bundling in oem products and services resale to customers and use in the provision of managed services to customers as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities the it service agreement provides for the performance by one of our subsidiaries of certain application development and maintenance and it infrastructure services for hp inc we rely on hp inc to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if hp inc is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its obligations with respect to the provision of transition services we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition if we do not have in place our own systems and services or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services in place once certain transition services expire we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline we are in the process of creating our own or engaging third parties to provide systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that hp inc provides to us under the transition services agreement however we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services or in transitioning from hp incs systems to our own systems and may pay more for such systems and services that we pay under the transition services agreement 

the separation may in the future result in disruptions to and negatively impact our relationships with our customers and other business partners in addition certain contracts that that needed to be assigned from hp inc or its affiliates to hewlett packard enterprise in connection with the separation and required the consent of the counterparty to such an assignment have not as yet and failure to obtain these consents could increase our expenses or otherwise harm our business and financial performance 

uncertainty related to the hewlett packard enterprises position postseparation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships or cause them to consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition the separation and distribution agreement provided for the assignment of a number of contracts from hp inc or its affiliates to us or our affiliates a minority of our customer contracts require the contractual counterpartys consent to assignment a small number of which remain outstanding postseparation if we are unable to obtain these consents we may be unable to obtain some of the benefits assets and contractual commitments that are intended to be allocated to us as 

part of the separation if we are unable to obtain these consents the loss of these contracts could increase our expenses or otherwise reduce our profitability 

indemnification liabilities to hp inc pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the separation and distribution agreement provides for among other things indemnification obligations generally designed to make us financially responsible for i liabilities primarily associated with our business ii our failure to pay perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such liabilities or contracts in accordance with their respective terms whether prior to at or after the distribution iii any guarantee indemnification obligation surety bond or other credit support agreement arrangement commitment or understanding by hp inc for our benefit unless related to liabilities primarily associated with the hp inc business iv any breach by us of the separation agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any action by us in contravention of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws and v any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading with respect to all information contained in our registration statement on form 10 or any other disclosure document that describes the separation or the distribution or hewlett packard enterprise and its subsidiaries or primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by the separation and distribution agreement subject to certain exceptions if we are required to indemnify hp inc under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

in connection with the separation hp inc has indemnified us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that hp incs ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements we have entered into with hp inc hp inc has agreed to indemnify hewlett packard enterprise for certain liabilities however third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that hp inc has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from hp inc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that hp inc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition hp incs insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the separation moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from hp inc or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities as a result of our separation from our former parent 

as a result of the separation from our former parent there are several significant areas where the liabilities of our former parent have or may become our obligations for example under the code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the consolidated us federal income tax return group of our former parent during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the distribution is severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the consolidated us federal income tax return group of our former parent for that taxable period consequently if hp inc is unable to pay the consolidated us federal income tax liability for a preseparation period we could be required to pay the amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation and distribution our former parent undertook several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which along with the separation and distribution may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation and distribution any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation and distribution 

• was insolvent • was rendered insolvent by reason of the separation and distribution • had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital or • intended to incur or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured then the court could void the separation and distribution in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer the court could then require our stockholders to return to hp inc some or all of the shares of hewlett packard enterprise common stock issued in the distribution or require hp inc or hewlett packard enterprise as the case may be to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors the measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as it matures

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below 

actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 79 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2015 were the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone 

we use a combination of forward contracts and from time to time options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2015 and 2014 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2015 and 2014 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 21 million and 14 million at october 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

interest rate risk 

we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing 

we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap 

transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial 

in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns 

we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2015 and 2014 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2015 and 2014 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 52 million and 7 million at october 31 2015 and 2014 respectively
