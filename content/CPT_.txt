narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2021 we owned interests in operated or were developing 176 multifamily properties comprised of 60073 apartment homes across the united states of the 176 properties five properties were under construction and will consist of a total of 1773 apartment homes when completed we also own land holdings which we may develop into communities in the future 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance we believe we are wellpositioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet our longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature the following 

  

• strong economic growth leading to household formation and job growth which in turn should support higher demand for our apartments and 

• an attractive quality of life which may lead to higher demand and retention for our apartments and allow us to more readily increase rents 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities and to redevelop reposition and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atthemarket atm share offering programs other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver highquality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of new leases and lease renewals achieved 

operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring customer satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections subject to restrictions of applicable law maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type such that lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns our average lease terms are approximately fourteen months and our individual property marketing plans are structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely responses to customers changing needs and a highlevel of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures or partnerships including limited liability companies through which we own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the joint venture or partnership we account for three investment funds collectively the funds utilizing the equity method of accounting as of december 31 2021 we had two discretionary investment funds which are closed to future investments and a third fund which we formed in march 2015 and as amended may be utilized for future multifamily investments of up to 360 million see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes or on the rents realized at our present properties or any newlydeveloped or acquired property

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate could adversely impact us 

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire assets and continue our development activities other weakened economic conditions including job losses high unemployment levels stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

• risks associated with a pandemic 

• local conditions such as an oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area 

• declines in the financial condition of our residents which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some residents 

• declines in market rental rates 

• low mortgage interest rates and home pricing making alternative housing more affordable 

• government or builder incentives which enable home buyers to put little or no money down making alternative housing options more attractive 

• regional economic downturns including but not limited to business layoffs downsizing and increased unemployment which may impact one or more of our geographical markets and 

• increased operating costs if these costs cannot be passed through to our residents 

shortterm leases could expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

our average lease terms are approximately fourteen months as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

we could be negatively impacted by the risks associated with land holdings and related activities 

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude us from developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair market value of our land holdings which is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

risks associated with our operations 

a pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

a pandemic and emergence of new variants have negatively impacted the global economy disrupted financial markets and international trade and resulted in varying unemployment levels all of which have negatively impacted the multifamily industry and the company’s business o utbreaks have led governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states to impose measures intended to mitigate its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as issuing guidelines travel bans border closings business closures quarantine orders and orders not allowing the collection of rents rent increases or eviction of nonpaying tenants 

the impact of an ongoing pandemic and measures to prevent its spread have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our businesses in a number of ways including our residents’ ability or willingness to pay rents and the demand for multifamily communities within the markets we operate in the event of resident nonpayment default or bankruptcy we could incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing our property additionally local and national authorities could continue to expand and extend certain measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce contractual rental obligations upon our residents and tenants the restrictions inhibiting our employees’ ability to meet with existing and potential residents has disrupted and could in the future further disrupt our ability to lease apartments which could adversely impact our rental rate and occupancy levels 

an ongoing pandemic has caused and could continue to cause severe economic market and other disruptions worldwide these conditions may continue and may worsen as a result of an ongoing pandemic in addition the deterioration of economic conditions as a result of a pandemic could ultimately decrease occupancy levels and market rents across our portfolio as residents reduce or defer their spending 

the uncertain duration and severity of a pandemic and its variants as well as continued periodic spikes in infection rates and local outbreaks of the virus and its variants in spite of safety measures or vaccinations could cause disruptions to our operations and those of our commercial tenants suppliers or vendors  for these reasons we are not able at this time to estimate with any degree of certainty the effect a pandemic or measures intended to curb its spread could have on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  moreover many of the other risk factors described within this form 10k could be more likely to impact us as a result of a pandemic or measures intended to curb its spread 

development repositions redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop reposition redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio in 2022 we expect to incur costs between approximately 150 million and 170 million related to the construction of five consolidated projects additionally during 2022 we expect to incur costs between approximately 150 million and 160 million related to the start of new development activities between approximately 62 million and 66 million related to repositions redevelopment repurposes and revenue enhancing expenditures and between approximately 80 million and 84 million of additional recurring capital expenditures our development reposition redevelopment and construction activities may also be exposed to a number of risks which may delay timely completion increase our construction costs andor decrease our profitability including the following 

  

• inability to obtain or delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required permits and authorizations 

• disruptions in the supply of materials or labor increased materials and labor costs problems with contractors or subcontractors or other costs including those costs due to errors and omissions which occur in the design or construction process 

• shortages of materials 

• inability to obtain financing with favorable terms 

• inability to complete construction andor leaseup of a community on schedule 

• forecasted occupancy and rental rates may differ from the actual results and 

• the incurrence of costs related to the abandonment of development opportunities which we have pursued and subsequently deemed unfeasible 

our inability to successfully implement our development repositions redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and assumes the risk when these estimates are greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict these factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions 

we could be impacted by our investments through joint ventures and investment funds which involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including but not limited to the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire a joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement 

the risks associated with our funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor include but are not limited to the following 

• one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of the funds and has unlimited liability for the thirdparty debts obligations and liabilities of the funds pursuant to partnership law 

• investors in the funds other than us may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the funds with or without cause and the funds’ advisory boards by a majority vote of their members and may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the funds at any time for cause 

• while we have broad discretion to manage the funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the funds the investors of the funds advisory boards must approve certain matters and as a result we may be unable to make certain investments or implement certain decisions on behalf of the funds which we consider beneficial 

• our ability to dispose of all or a portion of our investments in the funds is subject to significant restrictions and 

• we may be liable if the funds fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to the following 

  

• we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties into our existing operations 

• our estimates of the costs if any of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate 

• the expected occupancy rental rates and operating expenses may differ from the actual results 

• we may not be able to obtain adequate financing and 

• we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us and may not achieve expected returns or other benefits as a result of integration challenges such as personnel and technology 

changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations and property values  

certain states and local municipalities have adopted rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations imposing restrictions on amounts of rent increases which may be charged there are a number of additional states and local municipalities in which we operate also considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider imposing rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations such laws and regulations could limit our ability to increase rents charge certain fees evict residents or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult to dispose of properties in certain circumstances the terms of laws and regulations recently enacted future laws and regulations which may be enacted as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such issues could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and could reduce the value of our operating properties 

failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future and the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we may be subject to federal and state income taxes for such year and we may not be able to requalify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years and may be subject to federal and state income taxes in those years as well this may also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which may adversely affect the value of our common shares 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders additionally in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income 

tax laws may continue to change at any time and any such legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on us 

tax laws remain under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process at the internal revenue service the us department of treasury and by various state and local tax authorities future changes in tax laws including administrative interpretations enacted tax rates or new pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect us in a number of ways including making it more difficult or more costly for us to qualify as a reit 

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business 

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations including internet and cloudbased systems and applications we also use mobile devices social networking outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers and residents such uses and the ongoing advancement in technology give rise to potential cybersecurity risks with increasing sophistication including but not limited to security breaches espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of confidential information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property including residents and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations we are also expanding our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks and may be liable for the consequential litigation and remediation costs additionally the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective and there can be no complete assurance of prevention or anticipation of such incidents the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive data confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of residents potential liability and competitive disadvantage any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our thirdparty service providers are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and in certain instances we rely significantly on thirdparty service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner all of these third parties face potential risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases we do not directly control any of these parties information technology security operations or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats accordingly we are subject to any flaw or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

we have significant debt which could have adverse consequences 

as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding debt of approximately 32 billion this indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to the following   

• our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions is increased and 

• our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and industry conditions is limited 

our unsecured credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the following 

  

• delay in resident lease commencements 

• decline in occupancy 

• failure of residents to make rental payments when due 

• the attractiveness of our properties to residents and potential residents 

• our ability to adequately manage and maintain our communities 

• competition from other available apartments and housing alternatives 

• changes in market rents 

• increases in operating expenses and 

• changes in governmental regulations such as eviction moratoriums rent control or stabilization laws regulating rental housing 

cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties minimum dividend requirements to our equity holders development redevelopment and other capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the risk our indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

rising interest rates could both increase our borrowing costs thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and the amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and decrease our share price if investors seek higher yields through other investments  

we have an unsecured credit facility and an unsecured term loan bearing interest at variable rates on all amounts drawn we may incur mortgage debt or other additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

an environment of rising interest rates could also lead holders of our securities to seek higher yields through other investments which could adversely affect the market price of our shares one of the factors which may influence the price of our stock in public markets is the annual distribution rate we pay as compared with the yields on alternative investments 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

fitch moodys and standard  poors the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of a with stable outlook a3 with stable outlook and a with stable outlook respectively on our senior unsecured debt as of december 31 2021 these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

we may be adversely affected by the phase out of libor 

our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan are indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor in late 2021 it was announced libor interest rates will cease publication altogether by june 30 2023 to address the potential for libor’s cessation the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york frbny in coordination with multiple other regulators and large industry participants convened the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” the arrc has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the preferred successor rate for libor we intend to incorporate relatively standardized replacement rate provisions into our liborindexed debt documents including a spread adjustment mechanism designed to equate to the current libor all in rate there is significant uncertainty with respect to the implementation of the phase out and what alternative indexes will be adopted which will ultimately be determined by the market as a whole it therefore remains uncertain how such changes will be implemented and the effects such changes would 

have on us and the financial markets generally these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing and on our financing costs 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing and amount of dividends from time to time 

general risk factors 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties 

we expect other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or achieve the expected profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

litigation risks could affect our business 

as an owner manager and developer of multifamily properties we may incur liability based on various conditions at our properties and the buildings thereon and we also have become and in the future may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us and not adequately covered by insurance could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses 

a certain number of our properties are located in areas which have experienced and may in the future experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather or other environmental events these adverse weather or natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property anticipated future revenue from the property and could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely impacted due to our share price fluctuations 

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including but not limited to the following 

  

• operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors 

• investor interest in our property portfolio 

• the reputation and performance of reits 

• the attractiveness of reits as compared to other investment vehicles 

• the results of our financial condition and operations 

• the perception of our growth and earnings potential 

• minimum dividend requirements 

• increases in market interest rates which may lead purchasers of our common shares to demand a higher yield and 

• changes in financial markets and national and regional economic and general market conditions

in august 2021 we created an atthemarket atm share offering program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares for an aggregate offering price of up to 5000 million the 2021 atm program in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2021 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our 900 million unsecured line of credit the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development activities and financing for acquisitions 

the 2021 atm program also permits the use of forward sale agreements which allows us to lock in a share price on the sale of common shares at the time the agreement is executed but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale of the applicable shares until a later date if we enter into a forward sale agreement we expect the applicable forward purchasers will borrow from third parties and through the applicable sales agent acting in its role as forward seller sell a number of common shares equal to the number of shares underlying the applicable agreement under this scenario we would not initially receive any proceeds from any sale of borrowed shares by the forward seller we would expect to physically settle each forward sale agreement with the relevant forward purchaser on or prior to the maturity date of a particular forward sale agreement by issuing our common shares in return for the receipt of aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of common shares underlying the particular forward sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price however at our sole discretion we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a particular forward sale agreement in which case we may not receive any proceeds from the issuance of common shares and we will instead receive or pay cash in the case of cash settlement or receive or deliver common shares in the case of net share settlement we have not entered into any forward sale agreements under the 2021 atm program 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we sold an aggregate of approximately 26 million common shares at an average price per share of 15757 for aggregate net consideration of approximately 4004 million under the 2021 atm program the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2021 atm program were used for general corporate purposes which included funding for development activities and financing for acquisitions we did not sell any additional shares subsequent to december 31 2021 and we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 976 million remaining available for sale under the 2021 atm program as of the date of this filing 

in june 2020 we created an atm share offering program through which we could but had no obligation to sell common shares for an aggregate offering price of up to 3627 million the 2020 atm program during the six months ended june 30 2021 we sold an aggregate of approximately 29 million common shares at an average price per share of 12664 for aggregate net consideration of approximately 3588 million in august 2021 we terminated the 2020 atm program with an aggregate offering price of approximately 02 million not sold there were no additional shares sold under the 2020 atm program from june 30 2021 through the date of the termination agreements and no further common shares were available for sale under this program 

see part iii item 12 for a description of securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development reposition redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities overall we focus on investing in markets characterized by highgrowth economic conditions strong employment and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments as of december 31 2021 we owned interests in operated or were developing 176 multifamily properties comprised of 60073 apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the property portfolio table below in addition we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

business environment and current outlook 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we believe the conditions in the multifamily industry market in which we operate have been challenging but continue to show signs of improvement during the year ended december 31 2021 our results reflect an increase in same store revenues of approximately 43 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher average rental rates and increased occupancy which we believe was primarily attributable to improving job growth favorable demographics with a higher propensity to rent versus buy higher demand for multifamily housing in our markets and a manageable supply of new multifamily housing 

we currently believe us economic and employment growth are likely to continue during 2022 and the supply of multifamily homes will remain at manageable levels if economic conditions were to worsen our operating results could be adversely affected 

consolidated results 

net income attributable to common shareholders increased approximately 1800 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 this increase was primarily due to the gains from the sale of three operating properties during the fourth quarter of 2021 and an 119 increase in property operations due to the growth attributable to our same store nonsame store and development and leaseup communities the increase was partially offset by higher depreciation expense related to the acquisition of four operating properties during 2021 see further discussion of our 2021 operations as compared to 2020 in results of operations below 

construction activity 

at december 31 2021 we had a total of five projects under construction to be comprised of 1773 apartment homes initial occupancies of these five projects are currently scheduled to occur within the next 18 months we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the five projects to be approximately 1994 million 

acquisitions 

operating properties during the year ended december 31 2021 we acquired one operating property comprised of 558 apartment homes located in dallas texas for approximately 1655 million in october and one operating property comprised of 368 apartment homes located in st petersburg florida for approximately 1763 million in august in june 2021 we also acquired one operating property comprised of 328 apartment homes located in franklin tennessee for approximately 1053 million and one operating property comprised of 430 apartment homes located in nashville tennessee for approximately 1863 million

approximately 146 acres of land in the woodlands texas for approximately 93 million and approximately 02 acres of land in st petersburg florida for approximately 21 million for future development purposes 

dispositions 

operating properties during the fourth quarter of 2021 we sold two operating properties comprised of a total of 652 apartment homes located in houston texas for approximately 1150 million and recognized a gain of approximately 811 million and one property comprised of 426 apartment homes located in laurel maryland for approximately 1450 million and recognized a gain of approximately 933 million 

other 

in august 2021 we created an atthe market atm share offering program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares and we may also enter into separate forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for an aggregate offering price of up to 5000 million the 2021 atm program 

in 2021 we issued approximately 55 million common shares under our 2020 and 2021 atm programs and received approximately 7592 million in net proceeds 

future outlook 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities and to redevelop reposition and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atm programs other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 6134 million in cash and cash equivalents and 8852 million available under our 9000 million unsecured credit facility as of december 31 2021 and through the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 976 million remaining available for sale under our 2021 atm program we believe scheduled repayments of debt during the next 12 months are manageable at approximately 3863 million which represents approximately 122 of our total outstanding debt and includes amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs of approximately 37 million additionally as of december 31 2021 and through the date of this filing 100 of our consolidated properties were unencumbered we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund new development redevelopment and other capital funding requirements we will however continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements 

property portfolio 

our multifamily property portfolio is summarized as follows 







1 refer to note 8 investments in joint ventures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our joint venture investments 

stabilized communities 

we generally consider a property stabilized once it reaches 90 occupancy during the year ended december 31 2021 stabilization was achieved at three consolidated operating properties and one unconsolidated joint venture operating property as follows 





completed construction in leaseup 

at december 31 2021 we had two consolidated completed operating properties in leaseup as follows 



1 excludes leasing costs which are expensed as incurred 

2 stabilization has been achieved at this property subsequent to yearend 

properties under development 

our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2021 included approximately 4747 million related to properties under development and land of this amount approximately 2963 million related to our projects currently under construction in addition we had approximately 1784 million primarily invested in land held for future development related to projects we currently expect to begin construction 

communities under construction at december 31 2021 we had five consolidated properties in various stages of construction as follows 



1 property in leaseup and was 65 leased at january 30 2022 

development pipeline communities  at december 31 2021 we had the following consolidated communities undergoing development activities 



1 represents our estimate of total costs we expect to incur on these projects however forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance results or events although we believe these expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment 

geographic diversification 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 our real estate assets by various markets excluding depreciation and investments in joint ventures were as follows 

  



results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio the leaseup of newly constructed properties acquisitions and dispositions where appropriate comparisons of income and expense for communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollarsperweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  



1 average monthly property revenue per apartment home for the year ended december 31 2020 includes approximately 91 million of resident relief funds paid to residents at our whollyowned communities who experienced financial losses caused by the pandemic and was recorded as a reduction to property revenues 

2 annualized total property expenses per apartment home for the year ended december 31 2020 includes approximately 45 million of directlyrelated pandemic expenses incurred at our operating properties 

  management considers property net operating income noi to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs we define noi as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes noi is further detailed in the propertylevel noi table as seen below noi is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered an indication of cash available to fund cash needs additionally noi as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income to noi for the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 are as follows 



propertylevel noi 12 

property noi as reconciled above is detailed further into the categories below for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 

  



 not a meaningful percentage 

1 same store communities are communities we owned and were stabilized since january 1 2020 excluding communities under redevelopment and properties held for sale nonsame store communities are stabilized communities not owned or stabilized since january 1 2020 including communities under redevelopment and excluding properties held for sale we define communities under redevelopment as communities with capital expenditures that improve a communitys cash flow and competitive position through extensive unit exterior building common area and amenity upgrades management believes same store information is useful as it allows both management and investors to determine financial results over a particular period for the same set of communities development and leaseup communities are nonstabilized communities we have developed since january 1 2020 excluding properties held for sale pandemic related impact relates to the resident relief funds which were established for our residents experiencing financial losses caused by the pandemic and includes the amount we paid to residents at our whollyowned communities as an adjustment to property revenues the pandemic related impact also includes direct related expenses incurred at our operating properties as a result of the pandemic dispositionsother includes those communities disposed of or held for sale which are not classified as discontinued operations nonmultifamily rental properties expenses related to land holdings not under active development and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses 

same store analysis 

same store property noi increased approximately 282 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase was due to an increase of approximately 400 million in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 partially offset by an increase of approximately 118 million in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 

the 400 million increase in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to an increase of approximately 309 million in rental revenues comprised of a 28 increase in average rental rates higher occupancy and higher other rental income partially offset by lower reletting fees net of uncollectible revenue the increase was also due to an increase of approximately 57 million in income from our bulk internet and other utility rebilling programs as well as an increase of approximately 34 million related to fees and other income 

the 118 million increase in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to higher property insurance expense of approximately 40 million due to higher premiums and claims incurred at our communities higher repairs and maintenance and utility expenses of approximately 27 million higher real estate taxes of approximately 22 million as a result of increased property valuations and rates at a number of our communities and lower property tax refunds higher general and administrative and other property expenses of approximately 15 million and higher salaries expense of approximately 14 million 

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis 

property noi from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 322 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increases were comprised of increases from nonsame store communities of approximately 273 million and increases from development and leaseup communities of approximately 49 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase in property noi from our nonsame store communities was primarily due to the acquisition of four operating properties during 2021 five operating properties reaching stabilization during 2020 and 2021 and the stabilization of four redevelopment properties in december 2020 the increase in property noi from our development and leaseup communities was primarily due to two development communities under leaseup which completed construction during 2021 and the timing of one other development community which was also under leaseup during the year ended december 31 2021 

the following table details the changes described above relating to nonsame store and development and leaseup noi 





pandemic related impact analysis 

the pandemic related impact was approximately 136 million for the year ended december 31 2020 due to the resident relief funds announced in april 2020 for our residents experiencing financial losses and directlyrelated pandemic expenses during the year ended december 31 2020 the company paid approximately 91 million in resident relief funds to approximately 7100 residents of our whollyowned communities which was recorded as a reduction to property revenues also during the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred approximately 45 million of directlyrelated pandemic expenses at our operating properties which included 28 million of bonuses paid to onsite employees providing essential services during the pandemic and approximately 17 million of other directlyrelated pandemic expenses 

dispositionsother property analysis 

dispositionsother property noi increased approximately 36 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase was due to higher noi from our retail properties primarily due to an approximate 35 million noncash retail straightline rent receivable adjustments incurred in 2020 the increase was partially offset by the disposition of three consolidated operating properties during the fourth quarter of 2021 

nonproperty income 

  



fee and asset management income from property management asset management construction and development activities at our joint ventures and our thirdparty construction projects decreased approximately 03 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the decrease for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to lower fees earned during 2021 due to decreased construction and development activity for one property held by one of the funds which completed construction in december 2020 the decrease was partially offset by higher fees earned related to an increase in thirdparty construction activity and increases in property management fees from the joint ventures in which we manage as a result of increased operating results during 2021 as compared to 2020 

interest and other income decreased approximately 17 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the decrease was primarily due to our sale of a consolidated technology joint venture in september 2020 and recognizing our proportionate share of the gain of approximately 15 million the decrease was also due to lower interest income in 2021 primarily due to reduced interest rates on our investments 

our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately 144 million and 120 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans as discussed below 

other expenses 



property management expenses which primarily represent regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations increased approximately 21 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase was primarily related to higher salary benefits and incentive compensation costs and higher travel related expenses partially offset by lower marketing and advertising expenses and pandemic related expenses in 2021 as compared to 2020 property management expenses were 23 of total property revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

fee and asset management expense from property management asset management construction and development activities at our joint ventures and our thirdparty construction projects increased approximately 06 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher expenses incurred due to an increase in thirdparty construction activities partially offset by lower expenses incurred in 2021 as a result of a development property held by one of the funds completing construction in december 2020 

general and administrative expenses increased approximately 57 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher salary benefits and incentive compensation costs and higher acquisition related expenses partially offset by lower professional fee expenses in 2021 as compared to 2020 excluding deferred compensation plans general and administrative expenses were 51 of total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

interest expense increased approximately 58 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the issuance of 750 million 291 senior unsecured notes during april 2020 the issuance of a 400 million unsecured floating rate term loan during october 2020 and lower capitalized interest resulting from lower average balances in our development pipeline the increase was partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of our 1000 million unsecured floating rate term loan in october 2020 and a decrease in interest expense recognized on our unsecured credit facility due to having lower balances outstanding during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 

depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 535 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization of inplace leases related to four acquisitions completed in 2021 the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions during 2020 and 2021 and the completion of redevelopments during 2020 the increase was partially offset by lower amortization of inplace leases related to the acquisition of two operating properties in december 2019 which was fully amortized during 2020 

our deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately 144 million and 120 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income related to these plans as discussed in the nonproperty income section above 

other 



the loss on early retirement of debt for the year ended december 31 2020 related to the early retirement of our 100 million unsecured term loan which was scheduled to mature in 2022 this loss is primarily related to the applicable unamortized loan costs 

the 1744 million gain on sale for the year ended december 31 2021 was due to the sale of two operating properties located in houston texas and the sale of one operating property located in laurel maryland during the fourth quarter the 04 million gain on sale in 2020 related to the sale of approximately 47 acres of land adjacent to one of our operating properties in raleigh north carolina for approximately 08 million 

equity in income of joint ventures increased approximately 17 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase was primarily due to an increase in earnings recognized during 2021 primarily relating to higher revenues from the stabilized operating properties owned by the funds the increase in 2021 was partially offset by a decrease in earnings related to one property held by one of the funds which completed construction in december 2020 and was under lease up through june 30 2021 at which time it reached stabilization we recognized our proportionate share of the loss while this property was in the leaseup phase of operations 

funds from operations “ffo” and adjusted ffo affo 

management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate supplementary measures of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies 

affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reits operating performance between periods or different companies our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo and affo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 



1 net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2020 includes an approximate 35 million noncash adjustment to retail straightline rent receivable and an approximate 148 million pandemic related impact the total pandemic related impact for the year ended december 31 2020 was comprised of 95 million related to the resident relief funds which were established in april 2020 of this amount approximately 91 million was paid to residents at our whollyowned communities and was recorded as a reduction to property revenues and approximately 13 million of resident relief funds paid to residents of the operating communities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures of which we recognized our ownership interest of 04 million in equity in income of joint ventures additionally we incurred approximately 45 million of pandemic expenses at our operating communities which included 28 million of bonuses paid to onsite employees who provided essential services during the pandemic and 17 million in other directlyrelated pandemic expenses we also incurred approximately 08 million related to the employee relief fund we established to help our employees impacted by the pandemic 

2 ffo diluted shares includes approximately 23 million weighted average share impact related to activity from our atm programs during the year ended december 31 2021 there was no atm activity during the yearended december 31 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

• extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable 

• managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt 

• maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios and 

• using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity 

our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 67 and 65 times for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income and other expenses after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense all of our properties were unencumbered at both december 31 2021 and 2020 our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 74 years at december 31 2021 

we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flow generated from operations other sources may include one or more of the following availability under our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity 

offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atm programs and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs over the next 12 months including 

  

• normal recurring operating expenses 

• current debt service requirements including debt maturities 

• recurring capital expenditures 

• reposition expenditures 

• funding of property developments redevelopments acquisitions and joint venture investments and 

• the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code 

factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws sources of financing the minimum reit dividend requirements our ability to complete asset purchases sales or developments the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds and our ability to access capital markets a variety of these factors among others could also be affected by the continuation of the pandemic 

cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

net cash from operating activities was approximately 5775 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to approximately 5193 million during the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was primarily due to the increase in property operations due to the growth attributable to our same store nonsame store and development and leaseup communities see further discussions of our 2021 operations as compared to 2020 in results of operations the increase was partially offset by lower cash inflows from operating accounts due to lower prepayment of rental income received from our residents higher interest payments on our unsecured debt and higher real estate tax payments in 2021 as compared to 2020 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2021 totaled approximately 8044 million as compared to 4296 million during the year ended december 31 2020 cash outflows during 2021 primarily related to the acquisition of four operating properties for approximately 6300 million and property development and capital improvements of approximately 4287 million these outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of three operating properties of approximately 2547 million cash outflows during 2020 primarily related to property development and capital improvements of approximately 4272 million and increases in nonreal estate assets of 75 million the increase in property development and capital improvements for 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to the acquisition of four land parcels in 2021 partially offset by a decrease in redevelopment activity and lower capital expenditures capitalized interest real estate taxes and other capitalized indirect costs the property development and capital improvements during 2021 and 2020 included the following 



net cash from financing activities totaled approximately 4214 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to approximately 3073 million during the year ended december 31 2020 cash inflows during 2021 primarily related to net proceeds of 7592 million from the issuance of approximately 54 million common shares from our atm programs these cash inflows were partially offset by approximately 3430 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders cash inflows during 2020 primarily related to net proceeds of approximately 7828 million from the issuance of 7500 million senior unsecured notes in april 2020 and a 400 million unsecured floatingrate term loan in october 2020 these cash inflows were partially offset by approximately 3334 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders the repayment of an unsecured floatingrate term 

loan of approximately 1000 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and net payment of 440 million of borrowings from our unsecured line of credit 

financial flexibility 

we have a 900 million unsecured credit facility which matures in march 2023 with two separate options to extend the facility for a period of sixmonths and may be expanded three times by up to an additional 500 million in the aggregate upon the satisfaction of certain conditions the interest rate on our unsecured credit facility is currently based upon libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under our credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 450 million or the remaining amount available under our credit facility our credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2021 and through the date of this filing 

our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to 500 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding on our 9000 million credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 148 million leaving approximately 8852 million available under our credit facility 

in august 2021 we created an atm share offering program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares and we may also enter into separate forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for an aggregate offering price of up to 5000 million the 2021 atm program in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2021 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our 900 million unsecured line of credit the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development activities and financing for acquisitions we issued approximately 26 million shares under our 2021 atm program during the year ended december 31 2021 and received approximately 4004 million in net proceeds as of december 31 2021 and through the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 976 million remaining available for sale under the 2021 atm program 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants and our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares at december 31 2021 we had approximately 1033 million common shares outstanding net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements and no preferred shares outstanding 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by fitch moodys and standard and poors which were a with stable outlook a3 with stable outlook and a with stable outlook respectively as of december 31 2021 we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility we believe scheduled repayments of debt during the next 12 months are manageable at approximately 3863 million which represents approximately 122 of our total outstanding debt and includes amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs of approximately 37 million see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities beyond 2022 interest payments related to the debt discussed above and as further discussed in note 9 will be approximately 1082 million for the year ended december 31 2022 and for the years ending 2023 through 2026 will be approximately 913 million 730 million 664 million and 664 million respectively and approximately 3769 million in the aggregate thereafter 

we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the five consolidated projects to be approximately 1994 million of this amount we expect to incur costs between approximately 150 million and 170 million during 2022 and to incur the remaining costs during 2023 additionally we expect to incur costs between approximately 150 million and 160 million related to the start of new development activities between approximately 62 million and 66 million of repositions redevelopment repurposes and revenue enhancing expenditures and between approximately 80 million and 84 million of additional recurring capital expenditures 

we anticipate meeting our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atm programs other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our annual taxable income in order to reduce the amount of income taxes our general policy is to distribute at least 100 of our taxable income in december 2021 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of 083 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 16 2021 this dividend was subsequently paid on january 18 2022 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2021 dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 332 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2021 

in the first quarter of 2022 the companys board of trust managers declared a first quarter dividend of 094 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of march 31 2022 future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2022 our annualized dividend rate for 2022 would be 376 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt at december 31 2021 our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately 5138 million as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

valuation of assets  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment indicators exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge we did not record any impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 or 2019 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date projected construction costs as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we believe the primary market risk we face is interest rate risk we seek to mitigate this risk by following established risk management policies which includes i maintaining prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt and ii extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable we also periodically use derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps with major financial institutions to manage a portion of this risk we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the table below summarizes our debt as of december 31 2021 and 2020 



in order to manage interest rate exposure we have utilized interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions these swaps which are settled upon issuance of the related debt are designated as cash flow hedges and the gains andor losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period the hedged interest payments affect earnings as of december 31 2021 we had no hedges outstanding 

we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at december 31 2021 or 2020 at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had a term loan outstanding of approximately 399 million and 397 million respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt listed in the table above would have been 100 basis points higher throughout 2021 and 2020 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 04 million for each period 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows holding other variables constant if interest rates would have been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2021 the fair value of our fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 1988 million

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2020 we owned interests in operated or were developing 174 multifamily properties comprised of 59104 apartment homes across the united states of the 174 properties seven properties were under construction and will consist of a total of 2254 apartment homes when completed we also own land holdings which we may develop into multifamily communities in the future 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet our longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature the following 

  

• strong economic growth leading to household formation and job growth which in turn should support higher demand for our apartments and 

• an attractive quality of life which may lead to higher demand and retention for our apartments and allow us to more readily increase rents 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities and to redevelop reposition and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atthemarket atm share offering programs other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver highquality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of new leases and lease renewals achieved 

operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections subject to restrictions of applicable law maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type such that lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer average lease terms of approximately fourteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures or partnerships including limited liability companies through which we own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land owned by the joint venture or partnership we account for three investment funds collectively the funds utilizing the equity method of accounting as of december 31 2020 we had two discretionary investment funds which are closed to future investments and a third fund which we formed in march 2015 and as amended may be utilized for future multifamily investments of up to 360 million see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes or on the rents realized at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate could adversely impact us 

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire assets and continue our development activities other weakened economic conditions including job losses high unemployment levels stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

• risks associated with the covid19 pandemic as discussed below 

• local conditions such as an oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area 

• declines in the financial condition of our residents which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some residents 

• declines in market rental rates 

• low mortgage interest rates and home pricing making alternative housing more affordable 

• government or builder incentives which enable home buyers to put little or no money down making alternative housing options more attractive 

• regional economic downturns including but not limited to business layoffs downsizing and increased unemployment which may impact one or more of our geographical markets and 

• increased operating costs if these costs cannot be passed through to our residents 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

our apartment leases are generally for a term of fourteen months or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities 

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude us from developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair market value of our land holdings which is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

risks associated with our operations 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread and impact have and continue to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in december 2019 covid19 was first reported in wuhan china and in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted financial markets and international trade and resulted in increased unemployment levels all of which negatively impacted the multifamily industry and the company’s business the outbreak has led governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states to impose measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our businesses in a number of ways including our residents’ ability or willingness to pay rents and the demand for multifamily communities within the markets we operate in some cases we have and may continue to restructure residents’ rent obligations which may be on terms not as favorable to us as those currently in place in the event of resident nonpayment default or bankruptcy we may incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing our property additionally local and national authorities may continue to expand and extend certain measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce contractual rental obligations upon our residents and tenants the restrictions inhibiting our employees’ ability to meet with existing and potential residents has disrupted and could in the future further disrupt our ability to lease apartments which has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our rental rate and occupancy levels 

for the safety of our employees as a result of covid19 we have also directed most of our personnel to work remotely and we have generally restricted onsite staff to only those personnel who perform essential activities which must be completed onsite our increased reliance on personnel working remotely pose challenges for our employees and our it systems and extended periods of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including cybersecurity and it systems management risks any of which could adversely impact our business operations 

the covid19 pandemic has also caused and is likely to continue to cause severe economic market and other disruptions worldwide we cannot assure you conditions will not continue to deteriorate as a result of the pandemic in addition the deterioration of economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may ultimately further decrease occupancy levels and market rents across our portfolio as residents reduce or defer their spending 

the situation surrounding the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and the potential for a material adverse impact on our operational and financial performance increases the longer the virus impacts activities in the united states and globally for this reason we are not able at this time to estimate to any degree of certainty the effect covid19 may have on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows all of which will depend on future developments including the duration of the outbreak business and workforce disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease  

moreover many of the other risk factors described within this form 10k may be more likely to impact us as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the responses to curb its spread 

development redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio in 2021 we expect to incur costs between approximately 220 million and 240 million related to the construction of seven consolidated projects additionally during 2021 we expect to incur costs between approximately 65 million and 75 million related to the start of new development activities between approximately 58 million and 62 million related to repositions and revenue enhancing expenditures of existing properties and between approximately 70 million and 74 million of additional recurring capital expenditures our development redevelopment and construction activities may also be exposed to a number of risks which may delay timely completion increase our construction costs andor decrease our profitability including the following 

  

• shelter in place stay at home or similar orders adopted by state and local authorities in response to covid19 which may require us to temporarily cease construction and have other adverse effects 

• inability to obtain or delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required permits and authorizations 

• disruptions in the supply of materials or labor increased materials and labor costs problems with contractors or subcontractors or other costs including those costs due to errors and omissions which occur in the design or construction process 

• inability to obtain financing with favorable terms 

• inability to complete construction and leaseup of a community on schedule 

• forecasted occupancy and rental rates may differ from the actual results and 

• the incurrence of costs related to the abandonment of development opportunities which we have pursued and subsequently deemed unfeasible 

our inability to successfully implement our development redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project to calculate the cost plus margin for the project fee but not to exceed a maximum amount and to assume the risk when these estimates may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions 

investments through joint ventures and investment funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including but not limited to the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us 

to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire a joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement we account for three investment funds collectively the funds utilizing the equity method of accounting as of december 31 2020 we had two discretionary investment funds and in march 2015 we completed the formation of a third fund with an unaffiliated third party which has not owned any properties since its formation the risks associated with our funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor include but are not limited to the following 

• one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of the funds and has unlimited liability for the thirdparty debts obligations and liabilities of the funds pursuant to partnership law 

• investors in the funds other than us may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the funds with or without cause and the funds’ advisory boards by a majority vote of their members may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the funds at any time for cause 

• while we have broad discretion to manage the funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the funds the investors or the funds advisory boards must approve certain matters and as a result we may be unable to make certain investments or implement certain decisions on behalf of the funds which we consider beneficial 

• our ability to dispose of all or a portion of our investments in the funds is subject to significant restrictions and 

• we may be liable if the funds fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to the following 

  

• we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties into our existing operations 

• our estimates of the costs if any of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate 

• the expected occupancy rental rates and operating expenses may differ from the actual results 

• we may not be able to obtain adequate financing and 

• we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us and may not achieve expected returns or other benefits as a result of integration challenges such as personnel and technology 

changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations and property values  

certain states and local municipalities have recently adopted rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations imposing restrictions on amounts of rent increases which may be charged there are a number of additional states and local municipalities in which we operate also considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider imposing rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations such laws and regulations could limit our ability to increase rents charge certain fees evict residents or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult to dispose of properties in certain circumstances the terms of laws and regulations recently enacted future laws and regulations which may be enacted as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such issues could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and could reduce the value of our operating properties 

failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future and the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we may be subject to federal and state income taxes for such year in addition we may not be able to requalify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years and may be subject to federal and state income taxes in those years as well this may also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which may adversely affect the value of our common shares 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders additionally in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational 

requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income 

tax laws may continue to change at any time and any such legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on us 

tax laws remain under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process at the internal revenue service the us department of treasury and by various state and local tax authorities future changes in tax laws including administrative interpretations enacted tax rates or new pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect us in a number of ways including making it more difficult or more costly for us to qualify as a reit 

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business 

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations including internet and cloudbased systems and applications we also use mobile devices social networking outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers and residents such uses and the ongoing advancement in technology give rise to potential cybersecurity risks with increasing sophistication including but not limited to security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of confidential information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property including residents and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations we are also expanding our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks and may be liable for the consequential litigation and remediation costs additionally the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective and there can be no complete assurance of prevention or anticipation of such incidents the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive data confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of residents potential liability and competitive disadvantage any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our thirdparty service providers are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and in certain instances we rely significantly on thirdparty service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner all of these third parties face potential risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases we do not directly control any of these parties information technology security operations or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats accordingly we are subject to any flaws in or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

we have significant debt which could have adverse consequences 

as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding debt of approximately 32 billion this indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to the following   

• our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions is increased and 

• our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and industry conditions is limited 

our unsecured credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the following 

  

• delay in resident lease commencements 

• decline in occupancy 

• failure of residents to make rental payments when due 

• the attractiveness of our properties to residents and potential residents 

• our ability to adequately manage and maintain our communities 

• competition from other available apartments and housing alternatives 

• changes in market rents 

• increases in operating expenses and 

• changes in governmental regulations such as eviction moratoriums rent control or stabilization laws regulating rental housing 

cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties minimum dividend requirements to our equity holders development redevelopment and other capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the risk our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

rising interest rates could both increase our borrowing costs thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and the amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and decrease our share price if investors seek higher yields through other investments  

we have an unsecured credit facility and an unsecured term loan bearing interest at variable rates on all amounts drawn we may incur mortgage debt or other additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

an environment of rising interest rates could also lead holders of our securities to seek higher yields through other investments which could adversely affect the market price of our shares one of the factors which may influence the price of our stock in public markets is the annual distribution rate we pay as compared with the yields on alternative investments 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

moody’s fitch and standard  poors the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and a with stable outlook respectively on our senior unsecured debt as of december 31 2020 these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined 

our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan are indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor many market participants anticipate that in the near future libor will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate and may cease being published altogether to address the potential for libor’s cessation the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york frbny in coordination with multiple other regulators and large industry participants convened the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” the arrc has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the preferred successor rate for libor we are closely monitoring the progress of the phaseout of libor and incorporating relatively standardized fallback language into our liborindexed debt documents for transitioning to an alternative index which is defined to be the index that becomes generally used by lenders and other market participants and a spread adjustment mechanism to prevent lenders from receiving a lower rate upon transition there is significant uncertainty with respect to how the phaseout will be implemented and what alternative index will be adopted which will ultimately be determined by the market as a whole it therefore remains uncertain how such changes will be implemented and the effects such changes would have on us and the financial markets generally these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing and on our financing costs 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing and amount of dividends from time to time 

general risk factors 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties 

we expect other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or achieve the expected profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

litigation risks could affect our business 

as an owner manager and developer of multifamily properties we may incur liability based on various conditions at our properties and the buildings thereon and we also have become and in the future may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us and not adequately covered by insurance could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses 

a certain number of our properties are located in areas which have experienced and may in the future experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather or other environmental events these adverse weather or natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property anticipated future revenue from the property and could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including but not limited to the following 

  

• operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors 

• investor interest in our property portfolio 

• the reputation and performance of reits 

• the attractiveness of reits as compared to other investment vehicles 

• the results of our financial condition and operations 

• the perception of our growth and earnings potential 

• minimum dividend requirements 

• increases in market interest rates which may lead purchasers of our common shares to demand a higher yield and 

• changes in financial markets and national and regional economic and general market conditions

in june 2020 we created an atthe market atm share offering program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares and we may also enter into separate forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for an aggregate offering price of up to 3627 million the 2020 atm program in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2020 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our 900 million unsecured line of credit the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development activities and financing for acquisitions 

the 2020 atm program permits the use of forward sales agreements which allows us to lock in a share price on the sale of common shares at the time the agreement is executed but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date if we enter into a forward sale agreement we expect the relevant forward purchasers will borrow from third parties and through the relevant sales agent acting in its role as forward seller sell a number of common shares equal to the number of shares underlying the agreement under this scenario we would not initially receive any proceeds from any sale of borrowed shares by the forward seller we expect to physically settle each forward sale agreement with the relevant forward purchaser on or prior to the maturity date of a particular forward sale agreement by issuing our common shares in return for the receipt of aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of common shares underlying the particular forward sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price however at our sole discretion we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a particular forward sale agreement in which case we may not receive any proceeds from the issuance of common shares and we will instead receive or pay cash in the case of cash settlement or receive or deliver common shares in the case of net share settlement during the year ended december 31 2020 and through the date of this filing we did not enter into any forward sale agreements nor were there any shares sold under the 2020 atm program as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3627 million remaining available for sale under the 2020 atm program

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities overall we focus on investing in markets characterized by highgrowth economic conditions strong employment and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments as of december 31 2020 we owned interests in operated or were developing 174 multifamily properties comprised of 59104 apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

impact of the coronavirus pandemic covid19 on our business 

covid19 has currently resulted in a widespread health crisis which has adversely affected international national and local economies and financial markets generally and has had an unprecedented effect on many industries including the multifamily industry the discussions below including without limitation statements with respect to outlooks of future operating performance and liquidity are subject to the future effects of covid19 and the responses to curb its spread which continue to evolve accordingly the full magnitude of the pandemic and its ultimate effect on our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity for future years is uncertain at this time 

additionally our property revenues and expenses have been and will likely continue to be impacted by covid19 for the three months ended december 31 2020 we collected approximately 986 of our same store scheduled rents and approximately 14 were delinquent our january collections are approximately 969 of our same store scheduled rents and approximately 31 are delinquent

net income attributable to common shareholders decreased approximately 957 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred a covid19 related impact of approximately 148 million comprised of 95 million related to the resident relief funds which were established in april 2020 of this amount approximately 91 million was paid to residents at our whollyowned communities and was recorded as a reduction to property revenues and approximately 13 million of resident relief funds paid to residents of the operating communities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures of which we recognized our ownership interest of 04 million in equity in income of joint ventures additionally we incurred approximately 45 million of covid19 expenses at our operating properties which included 28 million of bonuses paid to onsite employees who provided essential services during the pandemic and 17 million in other directlyrelated covid19 expenses during the year ended december 31 2020 we also incurred approximately 08 million related to the employee relief fund we established to help our employees impacted by covid19 which was recorded within general and administrative expenses 

in addition to the covid19 related expenses discussed above the decrease during the year ended december 31 2020 was also primarily due to a decrease of 495 million related to gains from operating property dispositions in 2019 higher depreciation expense of approximately 309 million and higher interest expense of approximately 108 million as compared to the same period in 2019 the decrease for the year ended december 31 2020 was partially offset by the approximate 120 

million loss on early retirement of debt in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the 02 million loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020 see further discussions of our 2020 operations as compared to 2019 in results of operations 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2020 reflect an increase in same store revenues of 11 as compared to 2019 these increases were primarily due to higher average rental rates which we believe was primarily attributable to our focus on highgrowth markets favorable demographics a manageable supply of new multifamily housing and in part many individuals choosing to rent versus buy the increase during the year ended december 31 2020 was partially offset by the impact of covid19 

challenges within the multifamily industry surfaced during 2020 due to covid19 factors adversely affecting demand for and rents received from our multifamily communities remained and continue to remain intense and pervasive across the united states overall weak consumer confidence high unemployment fears of a prolonged recession and governmentimposed moratoriums on our ability to collect rents andor evict nonpaying tenants among other factors have also persisted through the date of this filing based on our belief these conditions may continue we could have a decline in property revenues during fiscal year 2021 and beyond 

construction activity 

at december 31 2020 we had a total of seven projects under construction to be comprised of 2254 apartment homes initial occupancies of these seven projects are currently scheduled to occur within the next 27 months we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven projects to be approximately 3254 million the covid19 pandemic and efforts to curb its spread may adversely affect among other matters the timely completion and final project costs of some or all of our projects under development if for example we are required to temporarily cease construction experience delays in obtaining governmental permits and authorizations or experience disruption in the supply of or in the costs of materials or labor

future outlook 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities and to redevelop reposition and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atm programs other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 4204 million in cash and cash equivalents and 8880 million available under our 9000 million unsecured credit facility as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3627 million remaining available for sale under our 2020 atm program and do not have any debt maturing through the year ending 2021 additionally as of december 31 2020 and through the date of this filing 100 of our consolidated properties were unencumbered we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund new development redevelopment and other capital funding requirements we will however continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements 

property portfolio 

our multifamily property portfolio is summarized as follows 







1 refer to note 8 investments in joint ventures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our joint venture investments 

stabilized communities 

we generally consider a property stabilized once it reaches 90 occupancy during the year ended december 31 2020 stabilization was achieved at two consolidated operating properties as follows 





completed construction in leaseup 

at december 31 2020 we had two consolidated completed operating properties and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures had one completed operating property in leaseup as follows 



1 excludes leasing costs which are expensed as incurred 

2 property owned through an unconsolidated joint venture in which we own a 313 interest 

properties under development 

our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2020 included approximately 5642 million related to properties under development and land of this amount approximately 4446 million related to our projects currently under construction in addition we had approximately 1196 million primarily invested in land held for future development related to projects we currently expect to begin construction 

communities under construction at december 31 2020 we had seven consolidated properties in various stages of construction as follows 



1 the covid19 pandemic and efforts to curb its spread may adversely affect among other matters the timely completion and final project costs of some or all of our projects under development if for example we are required to temporarily cease construction experience delays in obtaining governmental permits and authorizations or experience disruption in the supply of or increases in the costs of materials or labor 

2 property in leaseup and was 26 leased at february 3 2021 

development pipeline communities  at december 31 2020 we had the following consolidated communities undergoing development activities 



1 represents our estimate of total costs we expect to incur on these projects however forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance results or events although we believe these expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment 

geographic diversification 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 our real estate assets by various markets excluding depreciation and investments in joint ventures were as follows 

  



results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio the leaseup of newly constructed properties acquisitions and dispositions where appropriate comparisons of income and expense for communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollarsperweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  



1 average monthly property revenue per apartment home for the year ended december 31 2020 includes approximately 91 million of resident relief funds paid to residents at our whollyowned communities who have experienced financial losses caused by covid19 and was recorded as a reduction to property revenues 

2 annualized total property expenses per apartment home includes approximately 45 million of directlyrelated covid19 expenses incurred at our operating properties for the year ended december 31 2020 

  management considers property net operating income noi to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs we define noi as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes noi is further detailed in the propertylevel noi table as seen below noi is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered an indication of cash available to fund cash needs additionally noi as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income to noi for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 are as follows

1 for 2020 same store communities are communities we owned and were stabilized since january 1 2019 excluding communities under redevelopment and properties held for sale nonsame store communities are stabilized communities not owned or stabilized since january 1 2019 including communities under redevelopment and excluding properties held for sale we define communities under redevelopment as communities with capital expenditures that improve a communitys cash flow and competitive position through extensive unit exterior building common area and amenity upgrades management believes same store information is useful as it allows both management and investors to determine financial results over a particular period for the same set of communities development and leaseup communities are nonstabilized communities we have developed since january 1 2019 excluding properties held for sale covid19 related impact relates to the resident relief funds which were established for our residents experiencing financial losses caused by covid19 and includes the amount we paid to residents at our whollyowned communities as an adjustment to property revenues the covid19 related impact also includes direct related expenses incurred at our operating properties as a result of the pandemic dispositionsother includes those communities disposed of or held for sale which are not classified as discontinued operations nonmultifamily rental properties expenses related to land holdings not under active development and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses 

same store analysis 

same store property noi decreased approximately 24 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 the decrease was due to an increase of approximately 123 million in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 partially offset by an increase of approximately 99 million in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 

the 123 million increase in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to higher real estate taxes of approximately 58 million as a result of increased property valuations at a number of our communities higher property insurance expenses of approximately 22 million as a 

result of higher premiums higher salary expenses of approximately 19 million higher utilities of approximately 16 million and higher repair and maintenance costs of approximately 08 million 

the 99 million increase in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to an increase of approximately 128 million in rental revenues primarily from a 16 increase in average rental rates of which approximately 62 million was recognized during the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to a 33 first quarter increase in average rental rates the increase during the year ended december 31 2020 was also due to an approximately 34 million increase in income from our bulk internet and other utility rebilling programs and an approximate 31 million higher net reletting and other rental income these increases for the year ended december 31 2020 were partially offset by lower occupancy of approximately 35 million higher bad debt expense of approximately 51 million due in part to covid19 and a decrease of approximately 08 million related to fee and other income due to waived late and other fees during covid19 

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis 

property noi from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 145 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 the increases were comprised of increases from nonsame store communities of approximately 152 million and partially offset by decreases from development and leaseup communities of approximately 07 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 the increase in property revenues and expenses from our nonsame store communities was primarily due to the acquisition of four operating properties during 2019 four operating properties reaching stabilization during 2019 and two operating properties reaching stabilization during the year ended december 31 2020 the slight decrease in property noi from our development and leaseup communities were primarily due to the timing of completion and partial leaseup of two development properties during the year ended december 31 2020 the following table details the changes described above relating to nonsame store and development and leaseup noi 



covid19 related impact analysis 

the direct covid19 related impact was approximately 136 million for the year ended december 31 2020 due to the resident relief funds and the covid19 directlyrelated expenses incurred at our operating properties in april 2020 we announced two resident relief funds for our residents experiencing financial losses caused by covid19 and the company paid approximately 91 million to approximately 7100 residents of our whollyowned communities which was recorded as a reduction to property revenues during the year ended december 31 2020 we also incurred approximately 45 million of directlyrelated covid19 expenses at our operating properties which included 28 million of bonuses paid to onsite employees who provided essential services during the pandemic and approximately 17 million of other directlyrelated covid19 expenses 

dispositionsother property analysis 

dispositionsother property noi decreased approximately 116 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower retail property noi of approximately 60 million which was primarily due to an approximate 35 million noncash retail straightline rent receivable adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of our collectability assessment and determining it was no longer probable certain leasing revenue would be collected from retail tenants and an approximate 18 million increase in retail bad debt expense the decrease was also due to approximately 49 million of property noi from the disposition of two consolidated operating properties in the fourth quarter of 2019 we had no operating property dispositions during the year ended december 31 2020 

nonproperty income

our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately 120 million and 217 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans as discussed below 

other expenses 



  not a meaningful percentage 

property management expenses which primarily represent regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations decreased approximately 11 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily related to lower incentive compensation expense and travel related expenses in 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease was partially offset by higher salary and benefit costs property management expenses were 23 and 25 of total property revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

fee and asset management expense from property management asset management construction and development activities at our joint ventures and our thirdparty construction projects decreased approximately 18 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower salaries and discretionary spending incurred in managing our joint ventures and construction activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 

general and administrative expenses increased approximately 04 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to higher salary and benefit costs higher professional expenses and higher information technology costs as compared to 2019 the increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and lower travel related expenses excluding deferred compensation plans general and administrative expenses were 51 of total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

interest expense increased approximately 108 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to the issuance of 600 million 367 senior unsecured notes in june 2019 the issuance of 300 million 341 senior unsecured notes in october 2019 and the issuance of 750 million 291 senior unsecured notes in april 2020 the increase was partially offset by the repayment of approximately 4393 million of secured conventional mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 52 in the first quarter of 2019 the redemption of our 250 million 478 senior unsecured notes due 2021 and the prepayment of an approximate 453 million 438 secured conventional mortgage note in october 2019 the increase was also partially offset by higher capitalized interest in 2020 resulting from higher average balances in our development pipeline and a decrease in interest expense recognized on our 100 million term loan which was repaid in october 2020 and had lower weighted average interest rates in 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase in 2020 was further offset by a decrease in interest expense recognized on our unsecured credit facility due to lower balances outstanding during 2020 as compared to 2019 

depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 309 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of four operating properties in 2019 the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions and the partial completion of redevelopments during 2020 and 2019 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the disposition of two operating properties in december 2019

other 



the loss on early retirement of debt for the year ended december 31 2020 related to the early retirement of our 100 million unsecured term loan which was scheduled to mature in 2022 this loss is primarily related to the applicable unamortized loan costs the loss for the year ended december 31 2019 related to the early redemption of our 250 million 478 senior notes due 2021 and the prepayment of a 453 million 438 secured conventional mortgage note due 2045 

the gain on sale for the year ended december 31 2020 was due to the sale of approximately 47 acres of land adjacent to one of our operating properties in raleigh north carolina for approximately 08 million the gain on sale in 2019 was due to the sale of two operating properties located in corpus christi texas in the fourth quarter 

equity in income of joint ventures decreased approximately 67 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in earnings due to the recognition of a 62 million proportionate share of gain in 2019 related to the sale of one operating property by one of the funds in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the approximate 13 million of resident relief funds paid to residents of the operating communities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2020 which was recorded as a reduction to property revenues we recognized our ownership interest of the resident relief funds of 04 million in equity in income of joint ventures the decrease in earnings was partially offset by lower interest expense recognized by operating properties owned by the funds due to lower weighted average interest rates on variable rate debt in 2020 as compared to 2019 

income tax expense increased approximately 09 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to an increase in state and local taxes and an increase in taxable income related to higher thirdparty construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary 

funds from operations “ffo” and adjusted ffo affo 

management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate supplementary measures of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies 

affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reits operating performance between periods or different companies our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo and affo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 



1 net income attributable to common shareholders includes an approximate 35 million noncash adjustment to retail straightline rent receivable and a 148 million covid19 related impact for the year ended december 31 2020 the total covid19 related impact for the year ended december 31 2020 was comprised of 95 million related to the resident relief funds which were established in april 2020 of this amount approximately 91 million was paid to residents at our whollyowned communities and was recorded as a reduction to property revenues and approximately 13 million of resident relief funds paid to residents of the operating communities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures of which we recognized our ownership interest of 04 million in equity in income of joint ventures additionally we incurred approximately 45 million of covid19 expenses at our operating communities which included 28 million of bonuses paid to onsite employees who provided essential services during the pandemic and 17 million in other directlyrelated covid19 expenses we also incurred approximately 08 million related to the employee relief fund we established to help our employees impacted by covid19 net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2019 included an approximate 120 million loss on early retirement of debt related to the redemption of our 478 senior notes due 2021 and the prepayment of a 438 secured conventional mortgage note due 2045 

liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

• extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable 

• managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt 

• maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios and 

• using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity 

our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 65 and 73 times for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income and other expenses after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense all of our properties were unencumbered at both december 31 2020 and 2019 our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 84 years at december 31 2020 

we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flow generated from operations other sources may include one or more of the following availability under our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atm programs and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2021 including 

  

• normal recurring operating expenses 

• current debt service requirements including debt maturities 

• recurring capital expenditures 

• reposition expenditures 

• funding of property developments redevelopments acquisitions and joint venture investments and 

• the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code 

factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws sources of financing the minimum reit dividend requirements our ability to complete asset purchases sales or developments the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds and our ability to access capital markets a variety of these factors among others could also be affected by covid19 

cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

net cash from operating activities was approximately 5193 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to approximately 5556 million during the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower cash inflows from operating accounts due to the timing of payments to vendors lower prepayment of rental income received from our residents and higher interest payments on our unsecured debt in 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease was also due to the covid19 impact on our property revenues and property expenses see further discussions of our 2020 operations as compared to 2019 in results of operations these decreases were partially offset by cash outflows related to the settlement of our forward interest rate swaps in 2019 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2020 totaled approximately 4296 million as compared to 7924 million during the year ended december 31 2019 cash outflows during 2020 primarily related to property development and capital improvements of approximately 4272 million and increases in nonreal estate assets of 75 

million these outflows were partially offset by a net decrease in notes receivable of 14 million cash outflows during 2019 primarily related to property development and capital improvements of approximately 4076 million the acquisition of four operating properties for approximately 4363 million and increases in nonreal estate assets of 172 million these outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of two operating properties of approximately 676 million and a net decrease in notes receivable of 14 million the increase in property development and capital improvements for 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to the timing and completion of four consolidated operating properties in 2019 and 2020 and the acquisition of development properties the property development and capital improvements during 2020 and 2019 included the following 



net cash from financing activities totaled approximately 3073 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to approximately 2207 million during the year ended december 31 2019 cash inflows during 2020 primarily related to net proceeds of approximately 7828 million from the issuance of 7500 million senior unsecured notes in april 2020 and a 400 million unsecured floatingrate term loan in october 2020 these cash inflows were partially offset by approximately 3334 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders the repayment of an unsecured floatingrate term loan of approximately 1000 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and net payment of 440 million of borrowings from our unsecured line of credit cash inflows during 2019 primarily related to net proceeds of approximately 8900 million from the issuance of 6000 million senior unsecured notes in june 2019 and 3000 million senior unsecured notes in october 2019 as well as net proceeds of 3532 million from the issuance of approximately 34 million common shares through an underwritten equity offering completed in february 2019 and approximately 02 million common shares through our 2017 atm program we also had net proceeds of 440 million of borrowings from our unsecured line of credit these cash inflows were partially offset by the repayment of approximately 4393 million of secured conventional mortgage debt in the first quarter of 2019 and the early redemption of our 250 million unsecured notes payable due 2021 and the prepayment of the approximate 453 million secured conventional mortgage note due 2045 and associated prepayment penalties in the fourth quarter of 2019 we also used approximately 3173 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders 

financial flexibility 

we have a 900 million unsecured credit facility which matures in march 2023 with two options to further extend the facility at our election for two additional sixmonth periods and may be expanded three times by up to an additional 500 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions the interest rate on our unsecured credit facility is based upon the libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under our credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 450 million or the remaining amount available under our credit facility our credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2020 and through the date of this filing 

our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to 500 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2020 we had approximately no borrowings outstanding on our 9000 million credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 120 million leaving approximately 8880 million available under our credit facility 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants and our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares at december 31 2020 we had approximately 974 million common shares outstanding net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements and no preferred shares outstanding 

in june 2020 we created the 2020 atm program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares and also enter into separate forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for an aggregate offering price of up to 3627 million in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2020 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our 900 million unsecured line of credit the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development activities and financing for acquisitions there were no shares sold under the 2020 atm program in the year ended december 31 2020 and no shares have been sold through the date of this filing as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3627 million remaining available for sale under the 2020 atm program 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s fitch and standard and poors which were a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and a with stable outlook respectively as of december 31 2020 we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility as of the date of this filing we did not have any debt maturing through the year ending december 31 2021 see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven consolidated projects to be approximately 3254 million of this amount we expect to incur costs between approximately 220 million and 240 million during 2021 and to incur the remaining costs during 2022 through 2023 additionally we expect to incur costs between approximately 65 million and 75 million related to the start of new development activities between approximately 58 million and 62 million of repositions and revenue enhancing expenditures and between approximately 70 million and 74 million of additional recurring capital expenditures the covid19 pandemic and efforts to curb its spread may adversely affect among other matters the timely completion and final project costs of some or all of our projects under development if for example we are required to temporarily cease construction experience delays in obtaining governmental permits and authorizations or experience disruption in the supply of or increases in the costs of materials or labor 

we anticipate meeting our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our 2020 atm program other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our annual taxable income in order to reduce the amount of income taxes our general policy is to distribute at least 100 of our taxable income in december 2020 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of 083 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 16 2020 this dividend was subsequently paid on january 15 2021 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2020 dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 332 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2020 

in the first quarter of 2021 the companys board of trust managers declared a first quarter dividend of 083 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of march 31 2021 future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2021 our annualized dividend rate for 2021 would be 332 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2020 

  



1 includes all available extension options amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs net of scheduled principal payments 

2 includes contractual interest payments for our senior unsecured notes and all available extension options the interest payments on our unsecured term loan with floating interest rates were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december 31 2020 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt at december 31 2020 our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately 5091 million as of december 31 2020 we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

our apartment leases are for an average term of approximately fourteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

valuation of assets  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment indicators exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date projected construction costs as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended december 31 2020 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we believe the primary market risk we face is interest rate risk we seek to mitigate this risk by following established risk management policies which includes i maintaining prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt and ii extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable we also periodically use derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps with major financial institutions to manage a portion of this risk we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the table below summarizes our debt as of december 31 2020 and 2019 



in order to manage interest rate exposure we have utilized interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions these swaps which are settled upon issuance of the related debt are designated as cash flow hedges and the gains andor losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period the hedged interest payments affect earnings as of december 31 2020 we had no hedges outstanding 

we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility under our unsecured credit facility at december 31 2020 and had approximately 440 million of borrowings outstanding at december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 and 2019 we also had term loans of approximately 397 million and 997 million respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt listed in the table above would have been 100 basis points higher throughout 2020 and 2019 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 04 million and 14 million respectively 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows holding other variables constant if interest rates would have been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2020 the fair value of our fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 2365 million

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2019  we owned interests in operated or were developing 172 multifamily properties comprised of 58315 apartment homes across the united states of the 172 properties eight properties were under construction and will consist of a total of 2208 apartment homes when completed we also own land holdings which we may develop into multifamily communities in the future 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet our longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature the following 

  

 subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities and to redevelop reposition and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atthemarket atm share offering programs other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver highquality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of new leases and lease renewals achieved 

operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type such that lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from twelve to fifteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures or partnerships including limited liability companies through which we own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land owned by the joint venture or partnership we account for three investment funds collectively the funds utilizing the equity method of accounting as of december 31 2019 we had two discretionary investment funds which are closed to future investments and a third fund which we formed in march 2015 and as amended may be utilized for future multifamily investments of up to 360 million see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes or on the rents realized at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property 

employees 

at december 31 2019  we had approximately 1650 employees including executive administrative and community personnel 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2019  we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries we will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate could adversely impact us  

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire assets and continue our development activities other weakened economic conditions including job losses high unemployment levels stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

 shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents  

our apartment leases are generally for a term of fifteen months or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income  

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities  

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude us from developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair market value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

risks associated with our operations 

development redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability  

we intend to continue to develop redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio in 2020  we expect to incur costs between approximately 220 million and 240 million related to the construction of seven consolidated projects additionally during 2020  we expect to incur costs between approximately 65 million and 75 million related to the start of new development activities between approximately 52 million and 56 million related to repositions and revenue 

enhancing expenditures of existing properties and between approximately 16 million and 20 million in extensive redevelopment expenditures of existing properties our development redevelopment and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

  

 our inability to successfully implement our development redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project to calculate the cost plus margin for the project fee but not to exceed a maximum amount and to assume the risk when these estimates may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions 

investments through joint ventures and investment funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor  

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including but not limited to the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire a joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement we account for three investment funds collectively the funds utilizing the equity method of accounting as of december 31 2019 we had two discretionary investment funds and in march 2015 we completed the formation of a third fund with an unaffiliated third party which did not own any properties in 2019 2018 or 2017 the risks associated with our funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor include but are not limited to the following 



competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties  

we expect other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or achieve the expected profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected  

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to the following 

  

 changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations and property values  

certain states and local municipalities have recently adopted rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations imposing restrictions on amounts of rent increases which may be charged based solely on market conditions there are a number of additional states and local municipalities in which we operate also considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider imposing rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations such laws and regulations could limit our ability to increase rents charge certain fees evict residents or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult to dispose of properties in certain circumstances the terms of laws and regulations recently enacted future laws and regulations which may be enacted as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such issues could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and could reduce the value of our operating properties 

failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences  

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future also the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we may be subject to federal and state income taxes for such year in addition we may not be able to requalify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years and may be subject to federal and state income taxes in those years as well this may also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which may adversely affect the value of our common shares 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders additionally in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income 

tax laws have recently changed and may continue to change at any time and any such legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on us  

tax laws remain under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process at the internal revenue service the us department of treasury and by various state and local tax authorities future changes in tax laws including to administrative interpretations enacted tax rates or new pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect us in a number of ways including making it more difficult or more costly for us to qualify as a reit 

litigation risks could affect our business  

as an owner manager and developer of multifamily properties we may incur liability based on various conditions at our properties and the buildings thereon and we also have become and in the future may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us and not adequately covered by insurance could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses  

a certain number of our properties are located in areas which have experienced and may in the future experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather or other environmental events these adverse weather or natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property anticipated future revenue from the property and could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the implementation of future enhancements to our new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business and operations  

we have completed the first phase of a multiyear implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system which replaced our previous financial accounting system this erp system maintains our books and records records transactions and provides important information relating to the operations of our business to our management the implementation of this erp system has required and will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources while we have invested and will continue to invest significant resources in planning and project management issues may arise during the implementation of future enhancements which may result in operational or financial reporting delays increased costs or other difficulties not presently contemplated any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of future enhancements to the erp system could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations including internet and cloudbased systems and applications we also use mobile devices social networking outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers and residents such uses and the ongoing advancement in technology give rise to potential cybersecurity risks with increasing sophistication including but not limited to security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of confidential information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property including residents and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations we are also expanding our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks and may be liable for the consequential litigation and remediation costs additionally the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective and there can be no complete assurance of prevention or anticipation of such incidents the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive data confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of residents potential liability and competitive disadvantage any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our thirdparty service providers are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and in certain instances we rely significantly on thirdparty service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner all of these third parties face potential risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases we do not directly control any of these parties information technology security operations or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats accordingly we are subject to any flaws in or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

we have significant debt which could have adverse consequences  

as of december 31 2019  we had outstanding debt of approximately 25 billion  this indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to the following   

 our unsecured credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured 

could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders  

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the following 

  

 cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties minimum dividend requirements to our equity holders development redevelopment and other capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt  

we are subject to the risk our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined  

our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan are indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor it is unclear whether libor will continue to be calculated or published as a reference ratebenchmark after 2021 to address the potential for libor’s cessation the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york frbny in coordination with multiple other regulators and large industry participants convened the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” the arrc has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the preferred successor rate for libor we are closely monitoring the progress of the phaseout of libor and incorporating relatively standardized fallback language into our liborindexed debt documents for transitioning to an alternative index which is defined to be the index that becomes generally used by lenders and other market participants and a spread adjustment mechanism to prevent lenders from receiving a lower rate upon transition there is significant uncertainty with respect to how the phaseout will be implemented and what alternative index will be adopted which will ultimately be determined by the market as a whole it therefore remains uncertain how such changes will be implemented and the effects such changes would have on us and the financial markets generally these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing and on our financing costs 

rising interest rates could both increase our borrowing costs thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and the amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and decrease our share price if investors seek higher yields through other investments  

we have an unsecured credit facility and an unsecured term loan bearing interest at variable rates on all amounts drawn we may incur mortgage debt or other additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates would adversely affect cash flow net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

an environment of rising interest rates could also lead holders of our securities to seek higher yields through other investments which could adversely affect the market price of our shares one of the factors which may influence the price of our stock in public markets is the annual distribution rate we pay as compared with the yields on alternative investments 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  

moody’s fitch and standard  poors the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and a with stable outlook respectively  on our senior unsecured debt as of december 31 2019 these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders  

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate  

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including but not limited to the following 

  

 the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations  

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements 

under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing and amount of dividends from time to time

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities overall we focus on investing in markets characterized by highgrowth economic conditions strong employment and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments as of december 31 2019  we owned interests in operated or were developing 172 multifamily properties comprised of 58315 apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

consolidated results 

net income attributable to common shareholders was approximately 2196 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 1561 million for the same period in 2018  the approximately 635 million  or 407 increase was primarily due to an increase from property operations relating to our existing operating newly developed and acquired operating communities the increase also related to gains recognized on dispositions in 2019 including two consolidated operating properties and our proportionate share of one operating property by one of our unconsolidated joint ventures these increases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense and a loss on early retirement of debt 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2019 reflect an increase in same store revenues of 37 as compared to 2018  these increases were primarily due to higher average rental rates which we believe was primarily attributable to improving job growth favorable demographics a manageable supply of new multifamily housing and in part to more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the continued low level of homeownership rates we believe the continued low levels of homeownership rates are mainly attributable to costs of obtaining mortgage loans as well as changing trends of certain agesectors having a higher propensity to rent all of which promote apartment rentals we also believe us economic and employment growth are likely to continue during 2020 and the supply of new multifamily homes will likely remain at manageable levels if economic conditions were to worsen or any of these factors were to adversely change our operating results could be adversely affected 

construction activity 

at december 31 2019  we had a total of eight projects under construction to be comprised of 2208 apartment homes including one development project to be comprised of 234 apartment homes owned by one of our unconsolidated discretionary investment funds in which we have a 313 ownership interest initial occupancies of these eight projects are currently scheduled to occur within the next 24 months excluding the project owned by one of the funds we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven projects to be approximately 3586 million

other 

 future outlook 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities and to redevelop reposition and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atm programs other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 232 million in cash and cash equivalents and 8471 million available under our 9000 million unsecured credit facility as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 2877 million remaining available for sale under our 2017 atm program and do not have any debt maturing through the year ending 2021 additionally as of december 31 2019 and through the date of this filing 100 of our consolidated properties were unencumbered we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund new development redevelopment and other capital funding requirements we will however continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements

results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio the leaseup of newly constructed properties acquisitions and dispositions where appropriate comparisons of income and expense for communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollarsperweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  



management considers property net operating income noi to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs we define noi as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes noi is further detailed in the propertylevel noi table as seen below noi is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered an indication of cash available to fund cash needs additionally noi as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation

year ended december 2019 compared to year ended december 2018 

same store property noi increased approximately 246 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018  the increase was due to an increase of approximately 305 million in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2019  partially offset by an increase of approximately 58 million in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2019  as compared to the same period in 2018  

the 305 million increase in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2019  as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to an increase of approximately 286 million in rental revenues primarily from a 34 increase in average rental rates and an approximately 19 million increase in income from our bulk internet rebilling program 

the 58 million increase in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2019  as compared to the same period in 2018  was primarily due to higher salary expenses of approximately 39 million higher property insurance expenses of approximately 10 million as a result of higher premiums higher real estate taxes of approximately 07 million as a result of higher property valuations and tax rates at a number of our communities and higher other miscellaneous property expenses of approximately 06 million these increases were partially offset by an approximate 04 million decrease related to lower repair and maintenance costs as compared to the same period in 2018  

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis 

property noi from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 260 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018  the increase was due to an increase of approximately 424 million in revenues for the year ended december 31 2019  partially offset by an increase of approximately 164 million in expenses for the year ended december 31 2019  as compared to the same period in 2018  the increases in property revenues and expenses from our nonsame store communities were primarily due to the acquisition of three operating properties in 2018 and four operating properties in 2019 and the stabilization of one operating property in 2018 and three operating properties in 2019  the increases in property revenues and expenses from our development and leaseup communities were primarily due to the timing of completion and partial leaseup of two properties during 2019  the following table details the changes described above relating to nonsame store and development and leaseup noi 



dispositionsother property analysis

fee and asset management expense from property management asset management construction and development activities at our joint ventures and our thirdparty construction projects increased approximately 13 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018  the increase was primarily due to higher expenses incurred as a result of an increase in capital projects at fund communities and an increase in thirdparty construction activity

our deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately 217 million in 2019 and a benefit of approximately 65 million in 2018  these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income loss related to these plans as discussed in the nonproperty income section above 

other 



the loss on early retirement of debt for the year ended december 31 2019 related to the early redemption of our 250 million  478 senior notes due 2021 and the prepayment of a 453 million  438 secured conventional mortgage note due 2045 

gain on sale of operating properties for the year ended december 31 2019 was due to the sale of two operating properties located in corpus christi texas in the fourth quarter 

equity in income of joint ventures increased approximately 69 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018  the increase was primarily due to the recognition of a 62 million proportionate share of the gain related to the sale of one operating property by one of the funds in december 2019 as well as increases in earnings from the operating properties owned by the funds 

income tax expense decreased approximately 03 million for the year ended december 31 2019  as compared to 2018  the decrease was primarily due to lower state income taxes which included an approximate 01 million state income tax refund the decrease was partially offset by an increase in taxable income related to our thirdparty construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary 

funds from operations “ffo” and adjusted ffo affo 

management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate supplementary measures of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies 

affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reits operating performance between periods or different companies our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo and affo for the years ended december 31 are as follows

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

 our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 73 and 64 times for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income and other expenses after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense all of our properties were unencumbered at december 31 2019 and approximately 896 and 800 of our properties were unencumbered at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 89 years at december 31 2019  

we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flow generated from operations other sources may include one or more of the following availability under our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atm programs and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2020 including 

  

 factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws sources of financing the minimum reit dividend requirements our ability to complete asset purchases sales or developments the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds and our ability to access capital markets 

cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  

net cash from operating activities was approximately 5556 million during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to approximately 5037 million during the year ended december 31 2018  the increase was primarily due to growth attributable to our same store nonsame store communities and development and leaseup communities and changes in our operating accounts these increases were partially offset by cash outflows related to the settlement of our forward interest rate swaps in 2019 as compared to cash inflows received in 2018 see further discussions of our 2019 operations as compared to 2018 in results of operations 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2019 totaled approximately 7924 million as compared to 6409 million during the year ended december 31 2018  cash outflows during 2019 primarily related to property development and capital improvements of approximately 4076 million  the acquisition of four operating properties for approximately 4363 million  and increases in nonreal estate assets of 172 million  these outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of two operating properties of approximately 676 million and a net decrease in notes receivable of 14 million  cash outflows during 2018 primarily related to property development and capital improvements of approximately 3592 million  the acquisition of three operating properties for approximately 2900 million  and increases in nonreal estate assets of 145 million  these outflows were partially offset by the sale of land of approximately 113 million and a net decrease in notes receivable of 95 million  the increase in property development and capital improvements for 2019  as compared to the same period in 2018  was primarily due to the acquisition of three development properties in 2019 as compared to one development property in 2018 the timing and completion of five consolidated operating properties in 2018 and 2019  and the completion of repositions at several of our operating properties the property development and capital improvements during 2019 and 2018  included the following 



net cash from financing activities totaled approximately 2207 million during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to net cash used of approximately 1970 million during the year ended december 31 2018  cash inflows during 2019 primarily related to net proceeds of approximately 8900 million from the issuance of 6000 million senior unsecured notes in june 2019 and 3000 million senior unsecured notes in october 2019 as well as net proceeds of approximately 3532 million from the issuance of approximately 34 million common shares through an underwritten equity offering completed in february 2019 and approximately 02 million common shares through our 2017 atm program we also had net proceeds of 440 million of borrowings from our unsecured line of credit these cash inflows were partially offset by the repayment of approximately 4393 million of secured conventional mortgage debt in the first quarter of 2019 and the early redemption of our 250 million unsecured notes payable due 2021 and the prepayment of the approximate 453 million secured conventional mortgage note due 2045 and associated prepayment penalties in the fourth quarter of 2019 we also used approximately 3173 million to pay 

distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders cash outflows during 2018 primarily related to the repayment of approximately 3800 million variable and fixed rate secured conventional mortgage notes approximately 2980 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders and approximately 147 million for the repurchase of our common shares and redemption of units these cash outflows during 2018 were partially offset by net proceeds of approximately 4955 million from the issuance of 4000 million senior unsecured notes and the issuance of a 1000 million unsecured floatingrate term loan 

financial flexibility 

in march 2019 we amended and restated our 600 million unsecured credit facility to among other things extend the maturity date from august 2019 to march 2023 with two options to further extend the facility at our election for two additional sixmonth periods and increase the facility from 600 million to 900 million which may be expanded three times by up to an additional 500 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions the interest rate on our unsecured credit facility is based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under our credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 450 million or the remaining amount available under our credit facility our credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2019 and through the date of this filing 

our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to 500 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2019  we had approximately 440 million of borrowings outstanding on our 9000 million credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 89 million  leaving approximately 8471 million available under our credit facility 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants and our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares at december 31 2019  we had approximately 972 million common shares outstanding net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements and no preferred shares outstanding 

in may 2017 we created an atthe market atm share offering program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3153 million the 2017 atm program in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2017 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development activities and financing for acquisitions as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 2877 million remaining available for sale under the 2017 atm program no additional shares under the 2017 atm program were sold subsequent to december 31 2019 through the date of this filing 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s fitch and standard and poors which were a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and a with stable outlook respectively  as of december 31 2019 we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility as of the date of this filing we did not have any debt maturing through the year ending december 31 2021 see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven consolidated projects to be approximately 3586 million  of this amount we expect to incur costs between approximately 220 million and 240 million during 2020 and to incur the remaining costs during 2021  additionally we expect to incur costs between approximately 65 million and 75 million related to the start of new development activities between approximately 52 million and 56 million of repositions and revenue enhancing 

expenditures between approximately 16 million and 20 million in redevelopment expenditures and between approximately 72 million and 76 million of additional recurring capital expenditures 

we anticipate meeting our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our 2017 atm program other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our annual taxable income in order to reduce the amount of income taxes our general policy is to distribute at least 100 of our taxable income in december 2019  we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of 080 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 16 2019  this dividend was subsequently paid on january 17 2020 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2019 dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 320 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2019  

in the first quarter of 2020 the companys board of trust managers declared a first quarter dividend of 083 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of march 31 2020 future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2020 our annualized dividend rate for 2020 would be 332 as compared to a dividend rate of 320 in 2019 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2019  

  



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt at december 31 2019  our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately 4969 million  as of december 31 2019  we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from twelve to fifteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

valuation of assets  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future 

undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we believe the primary market risk we face is interest rate risk we seek to mitigate this risk by following established risk management policies which includes i maintaining prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt and ii extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable we also periodically use derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps with major financial institutions to manage a portion of this risk we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the table below summarizes our debt as of december 31 2019 and 2018 



in order to manage interest rate exposure we have utilized interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions these swaps which are settled upon issuance of the related debt are designated as cash flow hedges and the gains andor losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period the hedged interest payments affect earnings in 2019 we settled all remaining outstanding forward interest rate swaps with a total notional value of 300 million resulting in a net cash payment of approximately 204 million in 2018 we settled five forward interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 400 million in connection with the issuance of 400 million senior unsecured debt in october 2018 which resulted in a cash receipt of approximately 159 million as of december 31 2019  we had no hedges outstanding 

at december 31 2019  we had approximately 440 million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility and did not have any amount outstanding at december 31 2018 at december 31 2019 and 2018 we also had a term loan of approximately 997 million and 996 million respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt listed in the table above would have been 100 basis points higher throughout 2019 and 2018 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 14 million and 10 million respectively 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows holding other variables constant if interest rates would have been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2019  the fair value of our fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 1714 million

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2018  we owned interests in operated or were developing 167  multifamily properties comprised of 56858  apartment homes across the united states of the 167  properties six  properties were under construction and will consist of a total of 1698  apartment homes when completed we also own land holdings which we may develop into multifamily communities in the future 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance  we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet our longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature the following 

  

 subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities and to redevelop reposition and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowing the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our 2017 atthemarket atm share offering program other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver highquality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of new leases and lease renewals achieved 

operations  we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from twelve  to fifteen  months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures or partnerships including limited liability companies through which we own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land owned by the joint venture or partnership we account for three investment funds collectively the funds utilizing the equity method of accounting as of december 31 2018 we have two discretionary investment funds which are closed to future investments and a third fund which we formed in march 2015 for future multifamily investments of up to 450 million see note 9 “investments in joint ventures” and note 15 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

employees 

at december 31 2018  we had approximately 1600 employees including executive administrative and community personnel 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2018  we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate could adversely impact us  

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire assets and continue our development activities other weakened economic conditions including job losses high unemployment levels stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

 shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents  

our apartment leases are generally for a term of fifteen  months or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income  

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities  

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude us from developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair market value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect us  

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac are potential significant lenders both to us and to buyers of our properties fannie mae and freddie mac have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities and any changes to their mandates further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of their key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on us and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings 

fannie maes and freddie macs regulator has set overall volume limits on most of fannie maes and freddie macs lending activities the regulator in the future could require fannie mae and freddie mac to focus more of their lending activities on small borrowers or properties the regulator deems affordable which may or may not include our assets which could also adversely impact us in addition the members of the current presidential administration and house and senate banking committees have proposed various reform plans for fannie mae and freddie mac and there is uncertainty regarding the impact of these actions on us and buyers of our properties 

risks associated with our operations 

development redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability  

we intend to continue to develop redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio in 2019 we expect to incur costs between approximately 205 million  and 225 million  related to the construction of six  consolidated projects additionally during 2019 we expect to incur costs between approximately 95 million  and 105 million  related to the start of new development activities between approximately 46 million  and 50 million  related to repositions and revenue enhancing expenditures of existing properties and between approximately 25 million  and 33 million  in extensive redevelopment expenditures of existing properties our development redevelopment and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

  

 our inability to successfully implement our development redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project to calculate the cost plus margin for the project fee but not to exceed a maximum amount and to assume the risk when these estimates may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions 

investments through joint ventures and investment funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor  

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including but not limited to the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire a joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement we account for three investment funds collectively the funds utilizing the equity method of accounting as of december 31 2018 we had two discretionary investment funds and in march 2015 we completed the formation of a third fund with an unaffiliated third party and it did not own any properties in 2018 2017 or 2016 the risks associated with our funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor include but are not limited to the following 

 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties  

we expect other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or achieve the expected profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected  

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to the following 

  

 failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences  

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future also the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders additionally in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income 

tax laws have recently changed and may continue to change at any time and any such legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on us  

tax laws remain under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process at the internal revenue service and the us department of treasury and by various state and local tax authorities as evidenced by the 2017 jobs act signed into law 

in december 2017 future changes in tax laws including to the administrative interpretations thereof or to the enacted tax rates or new pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect us in a number of ways including making it more difficult or more costly for us to qualify as a reit 

litigation risks could affect our business  

as an owner manager and developer of multifamily properties we may incur liability based on various conditions at our properties and the buildings thereon and we also have become and in the future may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us and not adequately covered by insurance could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses  

a certain number of our properties are located in areas that have experienced and may in the future experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather these adverse weather or natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property anticipated future revenue from the property and could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system and problems with the design or implementation of this system could interfere with our business and operations  

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a cloudbased enterprise resource planning erp system which is planned to be deployed in phases beginning in 2019 the new erp system will replace multiple current business systems and is being designed to improve processes across the company the new erp system will maintain books and records record transactions and provide important information of the operations of our business to our management the implementation of the new erp system has required and will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources while we have invested and will continue to invest significant resources in planning and project management implementation issues may arise during the course of implementation and it is possible we may experience delays increased costs and other difficulties not presently contemplated any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could have a materially adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations including internet and cloudbased systems and applications we also use mobile devices social networking outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers and residents such uses and the ongoing advancement in technology give rise to potential cybersecurity risks with increasing sophistication including but not limited to security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of confidential information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property including residents and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations we are also expanding our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks and may be liable for the consequential litigation and remediation costs additionally the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective and there can be no complete assurance of prevention or anticipation of such incidents the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive data confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of residents potential liability and competitive disadvantage any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our thirdparty service providers are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and in certain instances we rely significantly on thirdparty service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner all of these third parties face potential risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases we do not directly control any of these parties information technology security operations or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats accordingly we are subject to any flaws in or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

we have significant debt which could have adverse consequences  

as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding debt of approximately 23 billion  this indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to the following 

  

 the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facilities and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders  

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the following 

  

 cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties minimum dividend requirements to our equity holders development redevelopment and other capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt  

we are subject to the risk indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and make distributions to our shareholders furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined  

our unsecured credit facilities unsecured term loan and fair value of derivative instruments are indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor central banks around the world including the federal reserve have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for libor based on observable market transactions it is expected a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years the uk financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor has announced it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to libor through the end of 2021 but it will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond such date accordingly there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of such rates beyond 2021 the federal reserve bank of new york and various other authorities have commenced the publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to us dollar libor although the full impact of such reforms and actions together with any transition away from libor including the potential or actual discontinuance of libor publication remains unclear these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing including liborbased loans and on our financing costs 

rising interest rates could both increase our borrowing costs thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and the amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and decrease our share price if investors seek higher yields through other investments  

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have unsecured credit facilities and an unsecured term loan bearing interest at variable rates on all amounts drawn we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates would adversely affect cash flow net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

an environment of rising interest rates could also lead holders of our securities to seek higher yields through other investments which could adversely affect the market price of our shares one of the factors which may influence the price of our stock in public markets is the annual distribution rate we pay as compared with the yields on alternative investments 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations  

from timetotime we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements for debt instruments and future debt issuances these agreements involve risks such as the risk the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  

moody’s fitch and standard  poors the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and bbb with positive outlook respectively  on our senior unsecured debt as of december 31 2018 in february 2019 standard and poors upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a with stable outlook these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders  

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate  

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including but not limited to the following 

  

 the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations  

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing and amount of dividends from time to time

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities overall we focus on investing in markets characterized by highgrowth economic conditions strong employment and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments as of december 31 2018  we owned interests in operated or were developing 167  multifamily properties comprised of 56858  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2018  reflect an increase in same store revenues of 32  as compared to 2017  these increases were due to higher average rental rates which we believe was primarily attributable to improving job growth favorable demographics a manageable supply of new multifamily housing and in part to more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the continued low level of homeownership rates we believe the continued low levels of homeownership rates are mainly attributable to difficulties in obtaining mortgage loans as well as changing demographic trends which demonstrate certain generations having a higher propensity to rent both of which promote apartment rentals we also believe us economic and employment growth are likely to continue during 2019 and the supply of new multifamily homes will likely remain at manageable levels if economic conditions were to worsen our operating results could be adversely affected 

construction activity 

at december 31 2018  we had six  projects under construction comprised of 1698  apartment homes with stabilization expected to be completed within the next 42 months as of december 31 2018  we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the six  projects to be approximately 3352 million  

acquisitions 

operating properties    during the year ended   december 31 2018   we acquired the following operating properties 

 land in april 2018 we acquired approximately 18  acres of land in orlando florida for approximately 114 million  for the future development of a community with 360  whollyowned apartment homes which started construction during the quarter ended june 30 2018 

dispositions 

land  in september 2018 we sold approximately 141  acres of land adjacent to two development properties in phoenix arizona for approximately 115 million  

future outlook 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities and to redevelop reposition and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowing the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our 2017 atm program other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages   

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 344 million  in cash and cash equivalents and 6349 million  available under our 6450 million  unsecured credit facilities as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3128 million  remaining available for sale under our 2017 atm program we believe scheduled payments of debt in 2019 are manageable at 4373 million  which represents approximately 188 of our total outstanding debt and includes the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs net of scheduled principal payments of approximately 18 million  we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover nearterm debt maturities and new development redevelopment and other capital funding requirements we will however continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements 

property portfolio 

our multifamily property portfolio is summarized as follows 

  







 

stabilized communities 

we generally consider a property stabilized once it reaches 90 occupancy during the year ended december 31 2018  stabilization was achieved at one consolidated operating property as follows 



completed construction in leaseup 

at december 31 2018  we had three consolidated completed operating properties in leaseup as follows 

1 excludes leasing costs which are expensed as incurred 

properties under development and land 

our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2018  included approximately 2940 million  related to properties under development and land of this amount approximately 1863 million  related to our projects currently under construction in 

addition we had approximately 1077 million  primarily invested in land held for future development related to projects we currently expect to begin constructing during the next two years 

communities under construction at december 31 2018  we had six  consolidated properties in various stages of construction as follows 

 development pipeline communities  at december 31 2018  we had the following consolidated communities undergoing development activities 





geographic diversification 

at december 31 2018  and 2017  our real estate assets by various markets excluding depreciation and investments in joint ventures were as follows 

  



results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio the leaseup of newly constructed properties acquisitions and dispositions where appropriate comparisons of income and expense for communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollarsperweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  



 

management considers property net operating income noi to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs we define noi as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes noi is further detailed in the propertylevel noi table as seen below noi is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered an indication of cash available to fund cash needs additionally noi as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income to noi for the year ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  are as follows

 same store analysis 

year ended december 2018 compared to year ended december 2017 

same store property noi increased approximately 172 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the same period in 2017  this increase was due to an increase of approximately 251 million  in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  partially offset by an increase of approximately 79 million  in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the same period in 2017  

the 251 million  increase in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in same store rental revenues of approximately 222 million from our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2018  which was primarily due to a 28 increase in average rental rates for our same 

store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the same period in 2017  the increase in same store property revenue was also due to a 29 million increase in other property revenues primarily due to increases in income from our bulk internet rebilling program for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the same period in 2017  

the 79 million  increase in same store property expense for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the same period in 2017  was primarily due to an increase of approximately 59 million in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations and tax rates at a number of our communities approximately 20 million of higher salary expenses and 10 million of higher utility and bulk internet program expenses these increases were partially offset by an approximate 16 million decrease related to lower repair and maintenance costs as compared to the same period in 2017  

year ended december 2017 compared to year ended december 2016 

same store property noi increased approximately 111 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  this increase was due to an increase of approximately 225 million  in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  partially offset by an increase of approximately 114 million  in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  

the 225 million  increase in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  was due in part to an increase in same store rental revenues of approximately 164 million for the year ended december 31 2017  which was primarily due to a 29 increase in average rental rates for our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  the increase in same store property revenue was also due to an increase of approximately 61 million in other property revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  primarily due to increases in income from our bulk internet rebilling program and miscellaneous fee income 

the 114 million  increase in same store property expense for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to increased costs of approximately 44 million associated with our bulk internet and other utility rebilling programs and a 39 million increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations at a number of our communities these increases were partially offset by decreased property insurance expenses of approximately 18 million during the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016

other 



the 03 million loss on early retirement of debt during the year ended december 31 2017  related to the early retirement of our 307 million taxexempt secured note payable which was scheduled to mature in 2028 the loss is primarily related to the applicable unamortized loan costs 

for the year ended 2018 we sold approximately 141 acres of land adjacent to two development properties in phoenix arizona for 115 million which approximated its book value in 2017  we recognized a gain of approximately 432 million  related to the sale of one operating property which compares to an approximate 2949 million  gain recognized in 2016  related to the sale of one  dualphased property and six  other operating properties for the year ended 2016  we also sold 63  acres of land adjacent to an operating property in tampa florida for a gain of approximately 04 million

income tax decreased approximately 03 million in 2018 as compared to 2017 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our thirdparty construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary and a reduction in the effective tax rate following the enactment of the 2017 tax act the decrease in 2017  as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an approximate 05 million state income tax refund received in 2017  partially offset by an increase in taxable income related to our third party construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary 

funds from operations “ffo” and adjusted ffo affo 

management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate measures of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies 

affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reits operating performance between periods or different companies our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo and affo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

  

 

liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

 our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 64  58  and 55  times for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses and income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations approximately 896  800 and 783 of our properties were unencumbered at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 49  years at december 31 2018  

we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flow generated from operations other sources may include one or more of the following availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowing the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our 2017 atm program and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2019  including 

  

 factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing the minimum reit dividend requirements our ability to complete asset purchases sales or developments the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds and our ability to access capital markets

financial flexibility 

we have a 6000 million unsecured credit facility which matures in august 2019 with two sixmonth options to extend the maturity date at our election to august 2020 additionally we have the option to further increase our credit facility to 9000 million by either adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of the existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on this credit facility is based upon libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under this credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 3000 million or the remaining amount available under the credit facility our credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations on the date of this filing 

our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to 500 million  in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2018  we had no balances outstanding on our 6000 million  credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 101 million  leaving approximately 5899 million  available under our credit facility 

we also have a 450 million  unsecured shortterm borrowing facility which matures in may 2019 the interest rate is based on libor plus 095 at december 31 2018  we had no  balances outstanding on this unsecured shortterm borrowing facility leaving 450 million  available under this facility

in may 2017 we created an atthe market atm share offering program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3153 million  the 2017 atm program in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2017 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit or shortterm borrowing facilities the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development activities and financing for acquisitions as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3128 million  remaining available for sale under the 2017 atm program no additional shares under the 2017 atm program were sold subsequent to december 31 2018  through the date of this filing 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s fitch and standard and poors which were a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and bbb with positive outlook respectively  as of december 31 2018 in february 2019 standard and poors upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a with stable outlook we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility we believe scheduled payments of debt in 2019 are manageable at 4373 million  which represents approximately 188 of our total outstanding debt and includes amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs net of scheduled principle payments of approximately 18 million  see note 10 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the six  consolidated projects to be approximately 3352 million  of this amount we expect to incur costs between approximately 205 million  and 225 million  during 2019  and to incur the remaining costs during 2020  and 2021  additionally we expect to incur costs between approximately 95 million  and 105 million  related to the start of new development activities between approximately 46 million  and 50 million  of repositions and revenue enhancing expenditures between approximately 25 million  and 33 million  in redevelopment expenditures and between approximately 68 million  and 72 million  of additional recurring capital expenditures during 2019  

we anticipate meeting our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowings the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our 2017 atm program other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our annual taxable income in order to minimize paying income taxes our general policy is to distribute at least 100 of our taxable income in december 2018  we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of 077 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 17 2018  this dividend was subsequently paid on january 17 2019  and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2018  dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 308 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2018    

in the first quarter of 2019 the companys board of trust managers declared a first quarter dividend of 080 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of march 29 2019 future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2019 our annualized dividend rate for 2019 would be 320 as compared to a dividend rate of 308 in 2018 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2018  

  





offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt at december 31 2018  our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately 5107 million  of which our proportionate share was approximately 1598 million  as of december 31 2018  we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from twelve  to fifteen  months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

valuation of assets  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we believe the primary market risk we face is interest rate risk we seek to mitigate this risk by following established risk management policies which includes i maintaining prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt and ii extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable we also periodically use derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps with major financial institutions to manage a portion of this risk we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the table below summarizes our debt as of december 31 2018  and 2017 



in order to manage interest rate exposure we have utilized interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions these swaps which are settled upon issuance of the related debt are designated as cash flow hedges and the gains andor losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period the hedged interest payments affect earnings in 2018 we settled five forward interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 400 million in connection with the issuance of 400 million senior unsecured debt in october 2018 which resulted in a cash receipt of approximately 159 million as of december 31 2018 we have 300 million of forward interest rate swaps outstanding to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of expected debt issuances in 2019 

at december 31 2018 and 2017 we did not have any amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowings if interest rates on the variable rate debt listed in the table above would have been 100 basis points higher throughout 2018 and 2017 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 10 million and 18 million respectively 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows holding other variables constant if interest rates would have been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2018 the fair value of our fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 904 million

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2017  we owned interests in operated or were developing 162  multifamily properties comprised of 55143  apartment homes across the united states of the 162  properties seven  properties were under construction and will consist of a total of 2110  apartment homes when completed we also own land holdings which we may develop into multifamily communities in the future 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance  we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet our longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature the following 

  



subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop redevelop and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

we expect to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowing the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our 2017 atthemarket atm share offering program other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver highquality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of new leases and lease renewals achieved 

operations  we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six  to eighteen  months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures or partnerships including limited liability companies through which we own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land owned by the joint venture or partnership we currently have three discretionary investment funds the “funds” two of which are closed to future investments and the third of which we formed in march 2015 for future multifamily investments of up to 450 million see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

employees 

at december 31 2017  we had approximately 1600 employees including executive administrative and community personnel 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2017  we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate could adversely impact us  

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire assets and continue our development activities other weakened economic conditions including job losses high unemployment levels stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

 shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents  

our apartment leases are generally for a term of eighteen  months or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income  

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties condominiums singlefamily homes thirdparty providers of shortterm rentals and serviced apartments which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities  

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude us from developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair market value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect us  

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac are significant lenders both to us and to buyers of our properties fannie mae and freddie mac have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities and any changes to their mandates further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of their key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on us and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our 

borrowings fannie maes and freddie macs regulator has set overall volume limits on most of fannie maes and freddie macs lending activities the regulator in the future could require fannie mae and freddie mac to focus more of their lending activities on small borrowers or properties the regulator deems affordable which may or may not include our assets which could also adversely impact us in addition the members of the current presidential administration and house and senate banking committees have announced the reform of fannie mae and freddie mac is a priority and there is uncertainty regarding the impact of these actions on us and buyers of our properties 

risks associated with our operations 

development redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability  

we intend to continue to develop redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio in 2018 we expect to incur costs between approximately 140 million  and 160 million  related to the construction of seven  consolidated projects additionally during 2018 we expect to incur costs between approximately 45 million  and 55 million  related to the start of new development activities between approximately 37 million  and 41 million  related to repositions and revenue enhancing expenditures of existing properties and between approximately 28 million  and 32 million  in extensive redevelopment expenditures of existing properties our development redevelopment and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

  

 our inability to successfully implement our development redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project to calculate the cost plus margin for the project fee but not to exceed a maximum amount and to assume the risk when these estimates may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions 

investments through joint ventures and discretionary funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor  

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including but not limited to the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire a joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement the risks associated with our discretionary funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor include but are not limited to the following 



 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties  

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other multifamily reits will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or achieve the expected profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected  

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to the following 

  

 failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences  

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future also the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders additionally in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income 

tax laws have recently changed and may continue to change at any time and any such legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on us  

the 2017 tax act was signed into law on december 22 2017 the law includes significant changes to the us corporate income tax system including a federal corporate rate reduction from 35 to 21 for nonreit c corporations which may cause investors to perceive investments in reits to be less attractive than investments in the stock of nonreit c corporations the law also includes limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation which may result in our being 

required to pay higher dividends to continue to qualify as a reit at a time and in an amount that otherwise may not be in the best interest for us or our shareholders 

in addition tax laws remain under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process at the internal revenue service and the us department of treasury and by various state and local tax authorities changes to tax laws regulations or administrative interpretations which may be applied retroactively could adversely affect us in a number of additional ways including making it more difficult or more costly for us to qualify as a reit or decreasing real estate values generally 

we cannot predict the full impact of the 2017 tax act or whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us or our shareholders may be further changed any of these matters may significantly affect our liquidity and results of operations as well as the value of our shares 

litigation risks could affect our business  

as a publiclytraded owner manager and developer of multifamily properties we may incur liability based on various conditions at our properties and the buildings thereon and we also have become and in the future may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us and not adequately covered by insurance could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses  

a certain number of our properties are located in areas that have experienced and may in the future experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather these adverse weather or natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property anticipated future revenue from the property and could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers and residents such uses and the ongoing advancement in technology give rise to potential cybersecurity risks with increasing sophistication including but not limited to security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of confidential information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property including residents and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations we are also expanding our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks and may be liable for the consequential litigation and remediation costs additionally the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective and there can be no complete assurance of prevention or anticipation of such incidents the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive data confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of residents potential liability and competitive disadvantage any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our thirdparty service providers are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and in certain instances we rely significantly on thirdparty service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner all of these third parties face potential risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases we do not directly control any of these parties information technology security operations or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats accordingly we are subject to any flaws in or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

we have significant debt which could have adverse consequences  

as of december 31 2017  we had outstanding debt of approximately 22 billion  this indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to the following 

  

 the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facilities and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders  

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the following 

  

 cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties minimum dividend requirements to our equity holders development redevelopment and other capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt  

we are subject to the risk indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay amounts due on our debt and make distributions to our shareholders furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other 

remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined

rising interest rates could both increase our borrowing costs thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and the amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and decrease our share price if investors seek higher yields through other investments  

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have an unsecured credit facility bearing interest at variable rates on all amounts drawn we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates would adversely affect cash flow net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

an environment of rising interest rates could also lead holders of our securities to seek higher yields through other investments which could adversely affect the market price of our shares one of the factors which may influence the price of our stock in public markets is the annual distribution rate we pay as compared with the yields on alternative investments 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations  

from timetotime we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements for debt instruments and future debt issuances these agreements involve risks such as the risk the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  

moody’s fitch and standard  poors the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and bbb with stable outlook respectively  on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities overall we focus on investing in markets characterized by highgrowth economic conditions strong employment and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments as of december 31 2017  we owned interests in operated or were developing 162  multifamily properties comprised of 55143  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2017  reflect an increase in same store revenues of 29  as compared to 2016  these increases were due to higher average rental rates and increased other property income which we believe was primarily attributable to improving job growth favorable demographics a manageable supply of new multifamily housing and in part to more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the continued low level of homeownership rates all of which have resulted in higher rental rates we also believe the continued low levels of homeownership rates are mainly attributable to difficulties in obtaining mortgage loans as well as changing demographic trends both of which promote apartment rentals we also believe us economic and employment growth is likely to continue during 2018 and the supply of new multifamily homes will likely remain at manageable levels if economic conditions were to worsen our operating results could be adversely affected 

construction activity 

at december 31 2017  we had seven  projects under construction comprised of 2110  apartment homes with stabilization expected to be completed within the next 39 months as of december 31 2017  we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven  projects to be approximately 2823 million

future outlook

 same store analysis 

year ended december 2017 compared to year ended december 2016 

same store property noi increased approximately 111 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  this increase was due to an increase of approximately 225 million  in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  partially offset by an increase of approximately 114 million  in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  

the 225 million  increase in same store property revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016 was due in part to an increase in same store rental revenues of approximately 164 million for the year ended december 31 2017  which was primarily due to a 29 increase in average rental rates for our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  the increase in same store property revenue was also due to an increase of approximately 61 million in other property revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  primarily due to increases in income from our bulk internet rebilling program and miscellaneous fee income 

the 114 million  increase in same store property expense for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  was primarily due to increased costs of approximately 44 million associated with our bulk internet and other utility rebilling programs and a 39 million increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations at a number of our communities these increases were also due to higher property insurance expenses of approximately 18 million during the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  

year ended december 2016 compared to year ended december 2015 

same store property noi increased approximately 221 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  this increase was due to an increase of approximately 279 million  in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  partially offset by an increase of approximately 58 million  in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  

the 279 million  increase in same store property revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  was due in part to an increase in same store rental revenues of approximately 174 million for the year ended december 31 2016  which was primarily due to a 32 increase in average rental rates for our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the increase in same store property revenue was also due to an increase of approximately 105 million in other property revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  primarily due to increases in income from our bulk internet rebilling program and miscellaneous fee income 

the 58 million  increase in same store property expense for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to increased costs of approximately 55 million associated with our bulk internet and other utility rebilling programs and a 25 million increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations at a number of our communities these increases were partially offset by decreased property insurance expenses of approximately 30 million during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis 

property noi from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 210 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  the increase was due to an increase of approximately 335 million  in revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  partially offset by an increase of approximately 125 million  in expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  the increases in property revenues and expenses from our nonsame store communities were primarily due to the stabilization of four operating properties in 2016  and four operating properties in 2017  and the acquisition of one operating property in 2017 the increases in property revenues and expenses from our development and leaseup communities were primarily due to the timing of completion and partial lease up of one property during 2016  and 2017  and the partial leaseup of one property which was under construction at december 31 2017  

property noi from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 212 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the increase was due to an increase of approximately 333 million  in revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  partially offset by an increase of approximately 121 million  in expenses for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the increases in property revenues and expenses from our nonsame store communities were primarily due to the stabilization of five operating properties in 2015  and four operating properties in 2016  the increases in property revenues and expenses from our development and leaseup communities were primarily due to the completion and partial lease up of three properties during 2015  and two properties during 2016  and the partial leaseup of two properties which was under construction at december 31 2016

we incurred approximately 39 million of expenses at our whollyowned multifamily communities impacted by hurricanes harvey and irma in august and september 2017 respectively with no insurance recoveries anticipated during the year ended december 31 2017 

dispositionsother property analysis 

dispositionsother property noi decreased approximately 211 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  the decrease was primarily due to the disposition of one dualphased operating property and six other operating properties in 2016 and the disposition of one operating property in 2017  

dispositionsother property noi decreased approximately 128 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the decrease was primarily due to the disposition of three operating properties in 2015  and the disposition of one dualphase operating property and six other operating properties in 2016

 not a meaningful percentage 

fee and asset management income which represents income related to property management of our joint ventures and fees from thirdparty construction projects increased  approximately 13 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  and decreased approximately 01 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  the increase for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to an increase in higher thirdparty construction activity and higher fees earned on capital projects at fund communities the slight decrease for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to a 

decrease in development and construction fees earned due to the timing of the commencement and completion of the development of one community by one of our funds in 2015 partially offset by higher thirdparty construction activity 

interest and other income increased  approximately 08 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016 and increased approximately 16 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 2015 the increase for the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily due to higher interest income earned on investments in cash and cash equivalents due to maintaining higher average cash balances throughout the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016 the increase for 2016 was due to higher interest income earned on investments in cash and shortterm investments due to an increase in average cash balances and an increase in interest income earned due to higher average note receivable balances outstanding on our real estate secured loans to unaffiliated third parties in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 

our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately 166 million  in 2017  income of approximately 55 million  in 2016  and a loss of approximately 03 million  in 2015  these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense benefit related to these plans as discussed below the increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was also due to higher diversification of participants fully vested share awards into other equity securities in 2016 and 2017 

other expenses 

 not a meaningful percentage 

property management expenses which primarily represent regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations increased  approximately 06 million  for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016  and increased approximately 21 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 2015  the increase for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily related to higher salary and benefit costs higher professional expenses and higher education programs provided to our regional employees the increase for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses property management expenses were 29  of total property revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016 and were 28  of total property revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 

fee and asset management expense which represents expenses related to property management of our joint ventures and fees from thirdparty construction projects increased  approximately 01 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  and decreased  approximately 09 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  the slight increase  for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to higher expenses relating to an increase in thirdparty construction activity in 2017 as compared to 2016 the decrease  for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to lower professional fees incurred in managing our joint ventures and lower expenses incurred as a result of decreases in development and construction activity relating to the timing of one development community started and completed by one of the funds in 2015 the decrease  was partially offset by higher expenses relating to an increase in thirdparty construction activity in 2016 as compared to 2015 

general and administrative expenses increased  approximately 32 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  and increased  approximately 12 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  general and administrative expenses were 55  54  and 55  of total revenues excluding income loss on deferred 

compensation plans for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increase  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to higher salary and benefit costs 07 million of stormrelated expenses related to hurricanes harvey and irma in august and september 2017 and higher professional expenses the increase  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses due to higher deferred compensation amortization costs resulting from the accelerated vesting relating to certain trust managers and executive officers meeting the retirement eligibility and service requirements as defined in the 2011 share incentive plan of camden property trust and an increase in the value of awards granted in 2016 as compared to the value of awards which vested during the same period in 2015 

interest expense decreased  approximately 64 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  and decreased  approximately 42 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  the decrease  in interest expense in 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to the repayment of a 2468 million 583 senior unsecured note payable in may 2017 the decrease  was partially offset by lower capitalized interest during the year ended december 31 2017  resulting from lower average balances in our development pipeline 

the decrease  in interest expense in 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to the repayment of a 2500 million 508 senior unsecured note payable in june 2015 the decrease  was partially offset by lower capitalized interest during the year ended december 31 2016  resulting from lower average balances in our development pipeline and higher interest expense recognized on our variable rate debt due to higher weighted average interest rates in 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  

depreciation and amortization expense increased  approximately 138 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  and increased  approximately 92 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  the increase  in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the completion of units in our development pipeline the acquisition of one operating property in 2017 the completion of repositions and increases in capital improvements placed in service during 2017  and 2016  the increase  was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the disposition of one dualphased operating property and six other operating properties in 2016  and one operating property in 2017 

the increase  in depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions and increases in capital improvements placed in service during 2016 and 2015 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the disposition of one operating property during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the dispositions of one dualphased operating property and six other operating properties in 2016  

our deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately 166 million  in 2017 an expense of approximately 55 million  in 2016  and a benefit of approximately 03 million  in 2015  these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income loss related to these plans as discussed in the nonproperty income section above the increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was also due to higher diversification of participants fully vested share awards into other equity securities in 2016 and 2017 

other 



the 03 million loss on early retirement of debt during the year ended december 31 2017  related to the early retirement of our 307 million taxexempt secured note payable which was scheduled to mature in 2028 the loss on early retirement of debt primarily includes the applicable unamortized loan costs 

in 2017 we recognized a gain of approximately 432 million  related to the sale of one operating property which compares to an approximate 2949 million  gain recognized in 2016 related to the sale of one  dualphased property and six  other operating properties and an approximate 1040 million  gain recognized in 2015 related to the sale of three operating properties for the year ended 2016 we also sold 63  acres of land adjacent to an operating property in tampa florida for a gain of approximately 04 million  and for the year ended 2015 we also sold two  land holdings adjacent to operating properties in dallas and houston texas for a gain of approximately 03 million  

equity in income of joint ventures decreased  approximately 03 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  and increased approximately 10 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  the decrease in 2017 was primarily due to the recognition of approximately 04 million of expenses representing our share of ownership interest of hurricanerelated expenses incurred by the fund multifamily communities due to hurricanes harvey and irma in august and september 2017 the decrease in 2017 was also due to higher interest expense recognized by three operating properties owned by the funds which refinanced existing variable construction loans into permanent financing arrangements at higher rates these decreases were partially offset by an increase in earnings resulting from higher rental and other property revenues from the operating properties owned by the funds 

the increase in equity in income in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in earnings resulting from higher rental and other property revenues from the operating properties owned by the funds and the stabilization of one operating property owned by one of the funds during the first quarter of 2016 the increase was partially offset by higher real estate taxes as a result of increased property valuations at a number of the communities owned by the funds the increase was further offset by an increase in interest expense incurred during the year ended december 31 2016 resulting from interest capitalized during the year ended december 31 2015 while an operating property was under construction 

income tax expense decreased approximately 04 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016 and decreased approximately 03 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015 the decrease in 2017 was primarily due to an approximate 05 million state income tax refund received in 2017 partially offset by an increase in taxable income related to our third party construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower state tax rates in 2016 as compared to 2015 partially offset by an increase in taxable income related to our third party construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary 

funds from operations “ffo” and adjusted ffo affo 

management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate measures of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies 

affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reits operating performance between periods or different companies our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo and affo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

  

 

liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

 our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 58  55  and 52  times for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses and income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations approximately 800  783 and 799 of our properties were unencumbered at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 43  years at december 31 2017  

we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flow generated from operations other sources may include one or more of the following availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowing the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property 

dispositions equity issued from our 2017 atm program and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2018  including 

  

 factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing the minimum reit dividend requirements our ability to complete asset purchases sales or developments the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds and our ability to access capital markets 

cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  

net cash from operating activities was approximately 4347 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to approximately 4431 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  the decrease was primarily due to the disposition of 15 operating properties a retail center and approximately 196 acres of land classified as discontinued operations and the disposition of one dualphased operating property and six other operating properties during 2016 and one operating property during 2017  the decrease was also due to higher cash bonuses paid to employees in 2017 as compared to 2016 the decrease was partially offset by a growth in revenues attributable to increased rental rates at our same store communities and growth in the number of nonsame store properties resulting from eight operating properties reaching stabilization during 2016 and 2017  the timing of completion and partial leaseup of one operating property during 2016 and 2017 the partial leaseup of one property which was under construction at december 31 2017 and the acquisition of one operating property in 2017  see further discussions of our 2017 operations as compared to 2016 in results of operations 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2017  totaled approximately 1898 million  as compared to net cash from investing activities of approximately 6904 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  during 2017  we had cash outflows for property development and capital improvements of approximately 2991 million  during 2017 we also acquired an operating property located in atlanta georgia for approximately 583 million  and had increases of 20 million in a note receivable balance outstanding on a real estate secured loan to an unaffiliated third party these outflows were partially offset by cash receipts of 1000 million from the maturity of a shortterm investment and proceeds from the disposition of one operating property of 769 million  during 2016  we received approximately 6230 million from the sale of 15 operating properties a retail center and approximately 196 acres of land classified as discontinued operations as well as 5158 million from the sale of one dualphase operating property and six other operating properties and one land holding these cash inflows in 2016 were partially offset by cash outflows for property development and capital improvements of approximately 3430 million  the decrease in property development and capital improvements for 2017  as compared to the same period in 2016  was primarily due to the timing and completion of six consolidated operating properties in 2016 and 2017  partially offset by an increase in redevelopment expenditures relating to our reposition program at several of our operating properties the property development and capital improvements during 2017 and 2016  included the following 



during the year ended december 31 2016  cash outflows in investing activities also included the purchase of a shortterm investment for 1000 million and increases of 75 million in a note receivable balance outstanding on a real estate secured loans to an unaffiliated third party

the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  

net cash from operating activities was approximately 4431 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to approximately 4232 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  the increase was primarily due to higher net propertylevel noi primarily due to the growth in revenues attributable to increased rental rates from our same store communities and growth in the number of nonsame store properties resulting from the stabilization of nine operating properties in 2015 and 2016 the completion and partial leaseup of two operating properties in 2016 and the partial leaseup of two properties under construction at december 31 2016 the increase was also due to an approximate 100 million bonus paid to employees in 2015 relating to the restructuring of the funds in december 2014 the increase was partially offset by a decrease related to the disposition of 15 operating properties a retail center and approximately 196 acres of land classified as discontinued operations in 2016 as well as the disposition of three other operating properties in 2015 and the disposition of one dualphased operating property and six other operating properties in 2016 see further discussions of our 2016 operations as compared to 2015 in results of operations 

net cash from investing activities during the year ended december 31 2016  totaled approximately 6904 million  as compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately 2932 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  during 2016 we received approximately 6230 million net of expenses from the sale of 15 operating properties a retail center and approximately 196 acres of land classified as discontinued operations as well as approximately 5158 million net of expenses from the sale of one dualphased operating property and six other properties and one land holding these cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows for property development and capital improvements of approximately 3430 million  during 2016  as compared to approximately 4118 million  in 2015  primarily due to the completion of nine operating properties in 2015 and 2016 and the completion of repositions at several of our operating properties the expenditures related to property development and capital improvements during the years ended december 31 2016   and 2015  included the following 



during the year ended december 31 2016  cash outflows from investing activities also included the purchase of a shortterm investment for 1000 million during the year ended december 31 2015  cash outflows also included 138 million  relating to capital improvements and reposition expenditures from our discontinued operations these cash outflows were offset by proceeds of approximately 1450 million  from the sale of three operating properties and two land holdings 

net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately 9042 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to approximately 2732 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  during 2016 we had net payments of 2440 million  on our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings we also used approximately 6634 million  to pay distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders which included the 425 per common share special dividend payment made on september 30 2016 during 2015 we used 2500 million  to repay maturing unsecured notes payable and approximately 30 million  to pay principal amortization payments we also used approximately 2531 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders and approximately 95 million to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interests in two consolidated joint ventures the cash flows for 2015 were partially offset by net proceeds from our unsecured line of credit and other shortterm borrowings of 2440 million  

financial flexibility 

we have a 6000 million unsecured credit facility which matures in august 2019 with two sixmonth options to extend the maturity date at our election to august 2020 additionally we have the option to further increase our credit facility to 9000 million by either adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of the existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on this credit facility is based upon libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under this credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 3000 million or the remaining amount available under the credit facility our credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations on the date of this filing 

our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to 500 million  in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2017  we had no balances outstanding on our 6000 million  credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 134 million  leaving approximately 5866 million  available under our credit facility 

we also have a 450 million  unsecured shortterm borrowing facility which matures in may 2018 the interest rate is based on libor plus 095 at december 31 2017  we had no  balances outstanding on this unsecured shortterm borrowing facility leaving 450 million  available under this facility 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer from time to time common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares at december 31 2017  we had approximately 927 million  common shares outstanding net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements and no preferred shares outstanding 

in may 2017 we created an atthe market atm share offering program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3153 million  the 2017 atm program in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2017 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our 6000 million  unsecured line of credit the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development activities and financing for acquisitions as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3128 million  remaining available for sale under the 2017 atm program no additional shares under the 2017 atm program were sold subsequent to december 31 2017  through the date of this filing 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s fitch and standard and poors which are currently a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and bbb with stable outlook respectively  we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility we believe scheduled payments of debt in 2018  are manageable at approximately 1737 million  which represents approximately 79 of our total outstanding debt and includes amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs net of scheduled principal payments of approximately 13 million see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven  consolidated projects to be approximately 2823 million  of this amount we expect to incur costs between approximately 140 million  and 160 million  during 2018  and to incur the remaining costs during 2019  and 2020  additionally we expect to incur costs between approximately 45 million  and 55 million  related to the start of new development activities between approximately 37 million  and 41 million  of repositions and revenue enhancing expenditures between approximately 28 million  and 32 million  in redevelopment expenditures and between approximately 65 million  and 69 million  of additional recurring capital expenditures during 2018  

we anticipate meeting our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm 

borrowing the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from 2017 our atm program other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our annual taxable income in order to minimize paying income taxes our general policy is to distribute at least 100 of our taxable income in december   2017  we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of 075 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 15 2017  this dividend was subsequently paid on january 17 2018  and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2017  dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 300 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2017    

in the first quarter of 2018 the companys board of trust managers declared a first quarter dividend of 077 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of march 30 2018 future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2018 our annualized dividend rate for 2018 would be 308 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2017  

  



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt at december 31 2017  our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately 5145 million  of which our proportionate share was approximately 1610 million  as of december 31 2017  we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six  to eighteen  months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation  we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting investments acquired or created are evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities “vies” which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be a vie then the investment is evaluated for 

consolidation primarily using a voting interest model in determining if we have a controlling financial interest we consider factors such as ownership interests authority to make decisions kickout rights and participating rights we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined by gaap with respect to our investments occurs the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment 

asset impairment  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

cost capitalization  real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development capitalized interest is generally based on the weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized we begin capitalizing development construction and carrying costs when the development of the future real estate asset is probable and activities necessary to prepare the underlying real estate for its intended use have been initiated all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities the estimates used by management require judgment and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended december 31 2017  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2017  and 2016  



we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we utilize our unsecured credit facility and increase our variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 822 million the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately 18 million holding all other variables constant 

we currently use interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain indebtedness not for trading or speculative purposes during the year ended december 31 2017 we had three forward interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 2000 million  that become effective october 31 2018 to hedge a portion of anticipated future fixed rate debt issuances we expect to cash settle these contracts relating to these outstanding swaps upon the issuance of debt in 2018 and either pay or receive cash for the fair value of the swap at time of settlement the impact of settling our position assuming debt is issued as expected will be recognized over the life of the issued debt as an adjustment to interest expense 

derivative financial investments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements the company has agreements with derivative counterparties containing provisions where the company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the companys default on the indebtedness as of december 31 2017 the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position which excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements was approximately 05 million  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to securities exchange act exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e based on the evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our exchange act filings is accurately recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal controls there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d in rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act during our most recent fiscal quarter which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2016  we owned interests in operated or were developing 159  multifamily properties comprised of 55366  apartment homes across the united states of the 159  properties seven  properties were under construction and will consist of a total of 2573  apartment homes when completed we also own land holdings which we may develop into multifamily communities in the future 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance  we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet our longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature the following 

  



subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop redevelop and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we anticipate meeting our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atthemarket atm share offering program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver highquality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of new leases and lease renewals achieved 

operations  we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six  to eighteen  months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures or partnerships including limited liability companies through which we own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land owned directly by the joint venture or partnership we currently have three discretionary investment funds the “funds” two of which are closed to future investments and the third of which we formed in march 2015 for future multifamily investments of up to 450 million see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

employees 

at december 31 2016  we had approximately 1600 employees including executive administrative and community personnel 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2016  we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate could adversely impact us  

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire assets and continue our development activities other weakened economic conditions including job losses high unemployment levels stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

 shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents  

our apartment leases are generally for a term of eighteen  months or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income  

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities  

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair market value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect us  

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac are significant lenders both to us and to buyers of our properties fannie mae and freddie mac have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities and any changes to their mandates further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of their key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on us and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our 

borrowings fannie maes and freddie macs regulator has set overall volume limits on most of fannie maes and freddie macs lending activities the regulator in the future could require fannie mae and freddie mac to focus more of their lending activities on small borrowers or properties the regulator deems affordable which may or may not include our assets which could also adversely impact us in addition the members of the current presidential administration have announced restructuring and privatizing fannie mae and freddie mac is a priority of the current administration and there is uncertainty regarding the impact of this action on us and buyers of our properties 

risks associated with our operations 

development redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability  

we intend to continue to develop redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio in 2017 we expect to incur costs between approximately 150 million  and 170 million  related to the construction of seven  consolidated projects additionally during 2017 we expect to incur costs between approximately 20 million  and 30 million  related to the start of new development activities and between approximately 24 million  and 28 million  related to redevelopment of existing properties our development redevelopment and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

  

 our inability to successfully implement our development redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and to assume the risk when these estimates may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions 

investments through joint ventures and discretionary funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor  

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including but not limited to the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire a joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement the risks associated with our discretionary funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor include but are not limited to the following 



 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties  

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other multifamily reits will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or achieve the expected profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected  

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to the following 

  

 failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences  

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future also the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders additionally in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income 

tax laws and related interpretations may change at any time and any such legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on us  

tax laws are under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process at the internal revenue service and the us department of the treasury and by various state and local tax authorities changes to tax laws regulations or administrative interpretations which may be applied retroactively could adversely affect us in a number of ways including the following 

 

we cannot predict whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed any such change may significantly affect our liquidity and results of operations as well as the value of our shares 

litigation risks could affect our business  

as a publiclytraded owner developer and manager of multifamily properties we may incur liability based on various conditions at our properties and the buildings thereon and we also have become and in the future may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us and not adequately covered by insurance could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses  

certain of our properties are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including fires snow or ice storms windstorms tornadoes or hurricanes earthquakes flooding or other severe weather these adverse weather or natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future revenue from that property we could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers and residents such uses give rise to potential cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property including residents and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations we are also expanding our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive data confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of residents potential liability and competitive disadvantage any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our thirdparty service providers are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and in certain instances we rely significantly on thirdparty service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner all of these third parties face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases we do not directly control any of such parties information technology security operations or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats accordingly we are subject to any flaws in or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

we have significant debt which could have adverse consequences  

as of december 31 2016  we had outstanding debt of approximately 25 billion  this indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 

  

 the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facilities and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders  

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the following 

  

 cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties minimum dividend requirements to our equity holders development redevelopment and other capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt  

we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

rising interest rates could both increase our borrowing costs thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and the amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and decrease our share price if investors seek higher yields through other investments  

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have an unsecured credit facility bearing interest at variable rates on all amounts drawn we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates would adversely affect cash flow net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

an environment of rising interest rates could also lead holders of our securities to seek higher yields through other investments which could adversely affect the market price of our shares one of the factors which may influence the price of our stock in public markets is the annual distribution rate we pay as compared with the yields on alternative investments 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  

moody’s fitch and standard  poors the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and bbb with stable outlook respectively  on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders  

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate  

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including but not limited to the following 

  

 the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations  

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution 

requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing and amount of dividends from time to time

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities overall we focus on investing in markets characterized by highgrowth economic conditions strong employment and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments as of december 31 2016  we owned interests in operated or were developing 159  multifamily properties comprised of 55366  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2016  reflect an increase in same store revenues of 39  as compared to 2015  this increase was due to higher average rental rates and increased other property income which we believe were due to among other matters the continuation of improving economic conditions including job growth favorable demographics a manageable supply of new multifamily housing and in part to more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the moderating level of homeownership rates all of which have resulted in higher rental rates we believe us economic and employment growth is likely to continue during 2017  and the supply of new multifamily homes although increasing will likely remain at manageable levels if economic conditions were to worsen our operating results could be adversely affected 

construction activity 

at december 31 2016  we had seven  projects under construction to be comprised of 2573  apartment homes with stabilization expected to be completed within the next 42 months as of december 31 2016  we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven  projects to be approximately 2406 million  

acquisitions 

during the year ended december 31 2016  we acquired an aggregate of approximately of 46 acres of land located in denver colorado and charlotte north carolina for approximately 199 million all of the land parcels acquired in 2016 are currently in development as of   december 31 2016

results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio the leaseup of newly constructed properties acquisitions and dispositions where appropriate comparisons of income and expense for communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollarsperweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  



management considers property net operating income noi to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs we define noi as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes noi is further detailed in the propertylevel noi table as seen below noi is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or an indication of cash available to fund cash needs additionally noi as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income to noi for the year ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  are as follows

 same store analysis 

same store property noi increased approximately 221 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  this increase was due to an increase of approximately 279 million  in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  partially offset by an increase of approximately 58 million  in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  

the 279 million  increase in same store property revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015 was due in part to an increase in same store rental revenues of approximately 174 million for the year ended december 31 2016  which was primarily due to a 32 increase in average rental rates for our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the increase in same store property revenue was also due to an increase of approximately 105 million in other property revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  primarily due to increases in income from our bulk internet rebilling program and miscellaneous fee income 

the 58 million  increase in same store property expense for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  was primarily due to increased costs associated with our bulk internet rebilling program and a 25 million or 28 increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations at a number of our communities these increases were partially offset by decreased property insurance expenses during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  

same store property noi increased approximately 233 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  this increase was due to an increase of approximately 364 million  in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  partially offset by an increase of approximately 131 million  in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  

the 364 million  increase in same store property revenue during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  was due in part to an increase in same store rental revenues of approximately 265 million during the year ended december 31 2015  which was primarily due to a 41 increase in average rental rates for our same store portfolio during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  the increase in same store property revenue was also due to an increase of approximately 99 million in other property revenue during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  primarily due to increases in income from our bulk internet rebilling program and miscellaneous fee income 

the 131 million  increase in same store property expense during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to a 58 million or 66 increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations at a number of our communities as well as increased costs associated with our bulk internet rebilling program 

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis 

property noi from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 212 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the increase was due to an increase of approximately 333 million  in revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  partially offset by an increase of approximately 121 million  in expenses for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the increases in property revenues and expenses from our nonsame store communities were primarily due to the stabilization of five operating properties in 2015  and four operating properties in 2016  the increases in property revenues and expenses from our development and leaseup communities were primarily due to the completion and partial lease up of three properties during 2015  and two properties during 2016  and the partial leaseup of two properties which were under construction at december 31 2016  

property noi from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 256 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  the increase was due to an increase of approximately 423 million  in revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  partially offset by an increase of approximately 167 million  in expenses for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  the increases in property revenues and expenses from our nonsame store communities were primarily due to the stabilization of one operating property in 2014  and five operating properties in 2015  and the acquisition of one operating property in 2014  the increases in property revenues and expenses from our development and leaseup communities were primarily due to the completion and partial lease up of three properties in 2015  and the partial leaseup of one property which was under construction at december 31 2015  

dispositionsother property analysis 

dispositionsother property noi decreased approximately 128 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  the decrease was primarily due to the disposition of three operating properties in 2015  and the disposition of one dualphase operating property and six other operating properties in 2016  

dispositionsother property noi decreased approximately 188 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  the decrease was primarily due to the disposition of five operating properties in 2014  and three operating properties in 2015  

nonproperty income 

  

fee and asset management income which represents income related to property management of our joint ventures and fees from thirdparty construction projects decreased  approximately 01 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  and decreased approximately 28 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  the slight decrease for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to a decrease in development and construction fees earned due to the timing of the commencement and completion of the development of one community by one of our funds in 2015 partially offset by higher thirdparty construction activity the decrease for 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to lower development and construction fees earned due to the timing of development communities started and completed by our funds during 2014 and 2015 and our increase in ownership interest in two of the funds from 20 to 313 effective december 23 2014 we eliminate fee income provided by our funds to the extent of our ownership 

interest and other income increased  approximately 16 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015 and was relatively flat for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 2014 the increase for 2016 was due to higher interest income earned on investments in cash and shortterm investments due to an increase in average cash balances and an increase in interest income earned due to higher average note receivable balances outstanding on our real estate secured loans to unaffiliated third parties in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 

 our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately 55 million  in 2016  a loss of approximately 03 million  in 2015  and income of approximately 39 million  in 2014  these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense benefit related to these plans as discussed below 

other expenses 

property management expense which primarily represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations increased  approximately 21 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 2015  and increased approximately 10 million  for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 2014  these increases were primarily due to increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses property management expenses were 29  of total property revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  and were 28  of total property revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  

fee and asset management expense which represents expenses related to property management of our joint ventures and fees from thirdparty construction projects decreased  approximately 09 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  and decreased  approximately 06 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  the decrease  for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to lower professional fees incurred in managing our joint ventures 

and lower expenses incurred as a result of decreases in development and construction activity relating to the timing of one development community started and completed by one of the funds in 2015 the decrease  was partially offset by higher expenses relating to an increase in thirdparty construction activity in 2016 as compared to 2015 the decrease  for 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to lower expenses directly related to lower net revenues resulting from our change in ownership interest in two of the funds effective december 23 2014 

general and administrative expenses increased  approximately 12 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  and decreased  approximately 48 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  general and administrative expenses were 54  55  and 64  of total revenues excluding income loss on deferred compensation plans for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increase  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses due to higher deferred compensation amortization costs resulting from the accelerated vesting relating to certain trust managers and executive officers meeting the retirement eligibility and service requirements as defined in the 2011 share incentive plan of camden property trust and an increase in the value of awards granted in 2016 as compared to the value of awards which vested during the same period in 2015 

the decrease  in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014 was primarily due to approximately 100 million in onetime bonuses paid to employees in 2014 relating to the restructuring of the funds in december 2014 excluding the 100 million onetime bonus paid in 2014 general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 52 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 which was primarily related to an increase in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses partially offset by a slight decrease in professional fees 

interest expense decreased  approximately 42 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  and increased  approximately 24 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  the decrease  in interest expense in 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to the repayment of a 2500 million 508 senior unsecured note payable in june 2015 the decrease  was partially offset by lower capitalized interest during the year ended december 31 2016  resulting from lower average balances in our development pipeline and higher interest expense recognized on our variable rate debt due to higher weighted average interest rates in 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  

the increase  in interest expense in 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to increased interest expense from the issuance of a 2500 million 368 senior unsecured note payable in september 2014 and lower capitalized interest of approximately 29 million during the year ended december 31 2015 resulting from lower average balances in our development pipeline the increase  in 2015 was also due to an increase in interest expense relating to borrowings on our unsecured credit facility and unsecured shortterm borrowing facility as compared to the same period in 2014 the increase  in 2015 was partially offset by the repayment of a 2500 million 508 senior unsecured note payable in june 2015 and the repayment of two secured notes payable in april and september of 2014 

depreciation and amortization expense increased  approximately 92 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  and increased  approximately 189 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  the increase  in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions and increases in capital improvements placed in service during 2016  and 2015  the increase  was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the disposition of one operating property during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the dispositions of one dualphased operating property and six other operating properties in 2016  

the increase  in depreciation and amortization expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions increases in capital improvements placed in service during 2014 and 2015  and the acquisition of one operating property in october 2014 the increase  was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the dispositions of five operating properties in 2014 and three operating properties in 2015 

our deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately 55 million  in 2016 a benefit of approximately 03 million  in 2015  and an expense of 39 million  in 2014  these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income loss related to these plans as discussed in the nonproperty income section above 

other 



during the year ended december 31 2016  we recognized an approximate 2949 million  gain related to the sale of one  dualphased property and six  other operating properties during the year ended december 31 2015  we recognized an approximate 1040 million  gain related to the sale of three operating properties for the year ended 2016 we also sold 63  acres of land adjacent to an operating property in tampa florida for a gain of approximately 04 million  and for the year ended 2015 we sold two  land holdings adjacent to operating properties in dallas and houston texas for a gain of approximately 03 million  

during the year ended december 31 2014  we recognized an approximate 1557 million gain related to the sales of five operating properties and the sale of approximately 293 acres located adjacent to current operating and development communities for a gain on the sale of land of approximately 36 million the 12 million impairment associated with land holdings in 2014 reflects the difference between the land holdings carrying value and the sales price 

equity in income of joint ventures increased  approximately 10 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  and decreased approximately 09 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  the increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in earnings resulting from higher rental and other property revenues from the operating properties owned by the funds and the stabilization of one operating property owned by one of the funds during the first quarter of 2016 the increase was partially offset by higher real estate taxes as a result of increased property valuations at a number of the communities owned by the funds the increase was further offset by an increase in interest expense incurred during the year ended december 31 2016 resulting from interest capitalized during the year ended december 31 2015 while a property was under construction 

the decrease in equity in income of joint ventures in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the recognition of a 36 million proportionate share of the gain relating to the sale of two operating properties by the funds in 2014 the decrease was partially offset by an increase in earnings resulting from our increase in ownership interest in two of the funds from 20 to 313 effective december 23 2014 the decrease was further offset by an increase in earnings resulting from higher rental income from the stabilized operating properties owned by the funds and two operating properties owned by the funds reaching stabilization during the third quarter of 2014 

funds from operations “ffo” and adjusted ffo affo 

management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate measures of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies 

affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reits operating performance between periods or different companies our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo and affo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

  

1 the gain in 2014 represents our proportionate share of the gain on sale of two operating properties sold by the funds in 2014 

liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

 our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 55  52  and 50  times for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses and income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations approximately 783  799 and 795 of our properties were unencumbered at december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 49  years at december 31 2016  

we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand shortterm investments and cash flow generated from operations other sources may include one or more of the following availability under our unsecured credit facility 

proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm program and other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2017  including 

  

 factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets and interest rates changes in sources of financing the satisfaction of reit dividend requirements our ability to complete asset purchases sales or developments the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds and our ability to access capital markets 

cash flows

financial flexibility 

we have a 6000 million unsecured credit facility which matures in august 2019 with two sixmonth options to extend the maturity date at our election to august 2020 additionally we have the option to further increase our credit facility to 9000 million by either adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of the existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on this credit facility is based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under this credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 3000 million or the remaining amount available under the credit facility our credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations on the date of this filing 

our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to 500 million  in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2016  we had no balances outstanding on our 6000 million  credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 127 million  leaving approximately 5873 million  available under our credit facility 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer from time to time common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares at december 31 2016  we had approximately 875 million  common shares outstanding net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements and no preferred shares outstanding 

in november 2014 we created an atthemarket share offering program the atm program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to  3313 million  in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us we intend to use the net proceeds from any future sales under the atm program for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development redevelopment and investment projects and financing for acquisitions as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3153 million  remaining available for sale under the atm program 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s fitch and standard and poors which are currently a3 with stable outlook a with stable outlook and bbb with stable outlook respectively  we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility we believe payments of debt in 2017  are manageable at approximately 2760 million  which represents approximately 111 of our total outstanding debt and includes scheduled principal amortization of approximately 12 million see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven  consolidated projects to be approximately 2406 million  of this amount we expect to incur costs between approximately 150 million  and 170 million  during 2017  and to incur the remaining costs during 2018  and 2019  additionally we expect to incur costs between approximately 20 million  and 30 million  related to the start of new development activities between approximately 24 million  and 28 million  of additional redevelopment expenditures and between approximately 60 million  and 64 million  of additional recurring capital expenditures during 2017  

we anticipate meeting our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our annual taxable income in order to minimize paying income taxes our general policy is to distribute at least 100 of our taxable income in september 2016 our board of trust managers also declared a special dividend of 425 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of september 23 2016 which was paid on september 30 2016 the special dividend consisted of gains on dispositions of assets completed in 2016 and enabled us to distribute 100 of our taxable income we also paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units in december 2016 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of 075 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 16 2016 this dividend was subsequently paid on january 17 2017 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units excluding the special dividend and aggregated with previous 2016  dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 300 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2016    

in the first quarter of 2017 the companys board of trust managers maintained the 075 quarterly dividend rate per common share future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2017 our annualized dividend rate for 2017 would be 300 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2016  

  



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt at december 31 2016  our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately 5187 million  of which our proportionate share was approximately 1624 million  as of december 31 2016  we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six  to eighteen  months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation  we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting investments acquired or created are evaluated based on the 

accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities “vies” which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be a vie then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model in determining if we have a controlling financial interest we consider factors such as ownership interests authority to make decisions kickout rights and participating rights we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined by gaap with respect to our investments occurs the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment 

asset impairment  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

cost capitalization  real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development capitalized interest is generally based on the weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized we begin capitalizing development construction and carrying costs when the development of the future real estate asset is probable and activities necessary to prepare the underlying real estate for its intended use have been initiated all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities the estimates used by management require judgment and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended december 31 2016  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk derivatives are not entered into for speculative purposes 

the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2016  and 2015  



we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we utilize our unsecured credit facility and increase our variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 992 million the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately 21 million holding all other variables constant

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2015  we owned interests in operated or were developing 180  multifamily properties comprised of 62649  apartment homes across the united states of the 180  properties eight  properties were under construction and when completed will consist of a total of 2857  apartment homes we also own land holdings which we may develop into multifamily communities in the future 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance  we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature the following 

  

 1 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop redevelop and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

we expect to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we anticipate meeting our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash flow generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowings proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atthemarket atm share offering program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver highquality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of new leases and lease renewals achieved 

operations  we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to fifteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures or partnerships including limited liability companies through which we own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land owned directly by the joint venture or partnership we currently have three discretionary investment funds the “funds” two of which are closed to future investments and the third of which we formed in march 2015 for future multifamily investments of up to 450 million see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present communities or any newly developed or acquired community as well as in the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2015  we had approximately 1750 employees including executive administrative and community personnel our employee headcount has historically not varied significantly throughout the year 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2015  we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate could adversely impact us  

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development activities other weakened economic conditions including job losses high unemployment levels stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

 shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents  

our apartment leases are generally for a term of fifteen months or less as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income  

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities  

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair market value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect us  

there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac through their lender originator networks fannie mae and freddie mac are significant lenders both to us and to buyers of our properties fannie mae and freddie mac have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities and any changes to their mandates further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of their key personnel could have a significant impact on us and may among other things lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings fannie maes and freddie macs regulator has set overall volume limits on most of fannie maes and freddie macs lending activities the regulator in the future could require fannie mae and freddie mac to focus more of their lending activities on small borrowers or properties the regulator deems affordable which may or may not include our assets which could also adversely impact us 

risks associated with our operations 

development redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability  

we intend to continue to develop redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio in 2016 we expect to incur costs between approximately 190 million and 210 million related to the construction of eight consolidated projects additionally during 2016 we expect to incur costs between approximately 45 million and 55 million related to the start of new development activities and between approximately 19 million and 23 million related to redevelopment of existing properties our development redevelopment and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

  

 our inability to successfully implement our development redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and to assume the risk these estimates may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions 

investments through joint ventures and discretionary funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor  

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partner may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

the risks associated with our discretionary funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor include but are not limited to the following 

 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties  

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other multifamily reits will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or achieve the expected profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected  

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including but not limited to the following 

  

 tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences  

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

  

 we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders additionally in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income 

if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis from time to time we dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as section 1031 exchanges intermediary agents of section 1031 exchange transactions typically handle large sums of money in trusts misappropriation of funds by one of these agents could have a material negative impact on our results of operations additionally misappropriation of funds could result in the disposal of the property not qualifying for a tax deferred basis and adversely affect our financial condition it is also possible the qualification of a transaction as a section 1031 exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable in such case our taxable income and earnings and profits would increase which could increase the dividend income to our shareholders by reducing any return of capital they received in some circumstances we may be required to pay additional dividends or in lieu of additional dividends corporate income tax possibly including interest and penalties as a result we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional dividends or taxes and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available to distribute to our shareholders in addition if a section 1031 exchange were later to be determined to be taxable we may be required to amend our tax returns for the applicable year in question including any information reports we sent our shareholders 

litigation risks could affect our business  

as a publiclytraded owner developer and manager of multifamily properties we may incur liability based on various conditions at our properties and the buildings thereon and we also have become and in the future may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us and not adequately covered by insurance could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage  

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets by similar types of owners we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductible provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a catastrophic loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers and residents such uses give rise to potential cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property including residents and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations we are also expanding our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive data confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of residents potential liability and competitive disadvantage any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our thirdparty service providers are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and in certain instances we rely significantly on thirdparty service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner all of these third parties face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases we do not directly control any of such parties information technology security operations or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats accordingly we are subject to any flaws in or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

we have significant debt which could have adverse consequences  

as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding debt of approximately 27 billion  this indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 

  

 the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facilities and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders  

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including but not limited to the following 

  

 cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our adjusted taxable income this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties minimum dividend requirements to our equity holders development redevelopment and other capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt  

we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other 

remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk  

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have an unsecured credit facility and an unsecured shortterm borrowing facility bearing interest at variable rates on all amounts drawn on the facilities we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  

moody’s fitch and standard  poors the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of baa1 with positive outlook bbb with positive outlook and bbb with stable outlook respectively on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders  

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate  

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including but not limited to the following 

  

 the form timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations  

the form timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing and amount of dividends from time to time

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as of december 31 2015  we owned interests in operated or were developing 180  multifamily properties comprised of 62649  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2015  reflect an increase in same store revenues of 52  as compared to 2014  we believe this increase was due to the continuation of improving economic conditions including job growth favorable demographics a manageable supply of new multifamily housing and in part to more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the moderating level of homeownership rates all of which have resulted in higher rental rates and average occupancy levels we believe us economic and employment growth is likely to continue during the remainder of 2016  and the supply of new multifamily homes although increasing will likely remain at manageable levels if economic conditions were to worsen our operating results could be adversely affected 

construction activity 

at december 31 2015  we had eight  projects under construction to be comprised of 2857  apartment homes with initial occupancy scheduled to occur within the next 23 months as of december 31 2015  we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the eight  projects to be approximately 3101 million  

acquisitions 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we acquired three land parcels comprised of 581 acres of land located in phoenix arizona los angeles california and gaithersburg maryland for approximately 591 million 

dispositions 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we sold three operating properties comprised of 1376  apartment homes located in austin texas and tampa and brandon florida for approximately 1474 million  and we recognized a gain of approximately 1040 million  relating to these property sales we also sold two land holdings adjacent to operating properties in dallas and houston texas for approximately 11 million  and recognized a gain of approximately 03 million  

future outlook 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop redevelop and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise we expect to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we anticipate meeting our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowings proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm share offering program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 106 million  in cash and cash equivalents 2250 million  outstanding on our 600 million unsecured credit facility 190 million outstanding on our 40 million unsecured shortterm borrowing facility and as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3153 million  remaining available for sale under our 2014 atm program we believe payments on debt maturing in 2016  are manageable at approximately 190 million  which represents approximately 07 of our total outstanding debt and consists of amounts outstanding under our unsecured shortterm borrowing facility we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover nearterm debt maturities and new development redevelopment and other capital funding requirements we will however continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  increased approximately 315 million  or 45  from 2013  same store rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  increased approximately 271 million or 45 from 2013  primarily due to a 40 increase in average rental rates and an increase in average occupancy for our same store portfolio from 953 in 2013 to 958 in 2014 we believe the increase to rental revenue was due in part to the continuation of the improving economic conditions including job growth favorable demographics a manageable supply of new multifamily housing and more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the moderating level of homeownership rates all of which have resulted in higher rental rates and average occupancy levels additionally there was a 44 million increase in other property revenue during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  primarily due to increases in miscellaneous income combined with ancillary income from our utility rebilling programs 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 142 million  or 51  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  the increase was primarily due to a 58 million or 66 increase in real estate taxes as a result of increased property valuations at a number of our communities as well as increased costs associated with our bulk internet rebilling program 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 97 million  or 38  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  the increase was primarily due to a 43 million or 57 increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations and property tax rates at a number of our communities the increase was also due to higher salaries and benefits primarily due to higher medical costs the increase was also due to higher utility expenses and higher repairs and maintenance costs and partially offset by a 11 million decrease in property insurance expenses due to lower selfinsured losses and premiums for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis 

property revenues and property expenses from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 423 million  and 167 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  these increases in revenues and expenses in our nonsame store communities for 2015  as compared to 2014  were primarily due to the stabilization of one operating property in 2014 and five operating properties in 2015 and the acquisition of one operating property in 2014 these increases in revenues and expenses from our development and leaseup communities for 2015  as compared to 2014  were primarily due to the completion and partial lease up of three properties in 2015 and the partial lease up of one property which was under construction at december 31 2015 

property revenues and property expenses from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 262 million  and 107 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  these increases in our nonsame store communities for 2014  as compared to 2013  were primarily due to the acquisition of one operating property in 2014 and three operating properties in 2013 these increases were also due to revenues and expenses recognized in 2014 related to the stabilization of one operating property and 75 units at one of our consolidated operating properties in 2014 and the stabilization of three operating properties and an additional 75 units at one of our consolidated operating properties in 2013 the increases in revenues and expenses from our development and leaseup communities for 2014  as compared to 2013  were primarily due to the completion and partial lease up of two properties in 2014 and the partial lease up of four properties which were under construction at december 31 2014 

the following table details the impact of the foregoing on our revenues and expenses 



dispositionsother property analysis 

dispositionsother property revenues decreased approximately 333 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  and decreased approximately 26 million for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  the decrease in 2015  was primarily due to the disposition of five operating properties in 2014 and three operating properties in 2015 the decrease in 2014  was primarily due to a 09 million decrease in revenue from dispositions due to the timing of completion of the disposition of five operating properties in 2014 the decrease was also due to a lower below market lease amortization of approximately 09 million due to the timing of completion of the acquisition of operating properties in 2012 and 2013 below market leases are generally amortized over approximately six months upon completion of an acquisition which reflects the remaining average term of acquired leases the decrease was also due to a decrease in other income of approximately 08 million for the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from our nonmultifamily rental properties 

dispositionsother property expenses decreased approximately 144 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  and decreased approximately 07 million for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  the decrease in 2015  was primarily due to the disposition of five operating properties in 2014 and three operating properties in 2015 the decrease in 2014  was primarily due to lower property taxes expensed on land holdings on which we initiated development activities in the fourth quarter of 2013 as we start capitalizing expenses including property taxes on development properties at such time 

nonproperty income 

  

fee and asset management income which represents income related to property management of our joint ventures and fees from thirdparty construction projects decreased approximately 28 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  and decreased approximately 19 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  the decrease for 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to lower development and construction fees earned due to the timing of development communities started and completed by our funds during 2014 and 2015 and our increase in ownership interest in two of the funds from 20 to 313 effective december 23 2014 we eliminate fee income provided by our funds to the extent of our ownership the decrease for 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to the sale of 18 operating properties by three of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013 and 2014 this decrease was also due to lower construction fees resulting from a reduced level of thirdparty construction activities and lower development and construction fees earned due to the timing of development communities started and completed by our funds during 2013 and 2014 

  

our deferred compensation plans recognized a loss of approximately 03 million  in 2015  and recognized income of approximately 39 million  and 83 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively the net income loss for each period was related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and was directly offset by the expense benefit related to these plans as discussed below 

other expenses 

  

property management expense which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations   increased approximately 11 million  for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 2014  and increased approximately 09 million  for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 2013  these increases were primarily due to increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses property management expenses were 27  of total property revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  and 28  of total property revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 

fee and asset management expense which represents expenses related to property management of our joint ventures and fees from thirdparty construction projects decreased approximately 06 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  and decreased approximately 04 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  the decrease for 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to lower expenses directly related to lower net revenues resulting from our change in ownership interest in two of the funds effective december 23 2014 

the decrease in fee and asset management expense for 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to decreases in expenses relating to the sale of 18 operating properties by three of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013 and 2014 the decrease for 2014 as compared to 2013 was also due to lower expenses relating to the timing of communities started and completed by the funds during 2013 and 2014 

general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 48 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  and increased approximately 104 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  general and administrative expenses were 51  60  and 51  of total revenues excluding income loss on deferred compensation plans for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the decrease in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to approximately 100 million in onetime bonuses paid to employees in 2014 relating to the restructuring of the funds in december 2014 excluding the 100 million onetime bonus in 2014 general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 52 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 which was primarily related to an increase in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses partially offset by a slight decrease in professional fees 

the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to approximately 100 million in onetime bonuses paid to employees relating to the restructuring of the funds in december 2014 excluding this onetime bonus general and administrative expenses were 48 of total revenues excluding income on deferred compensation plans for the year ended december 31 2014 

interest expense increased approximately 24 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  and decreased approximately 49 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  the increase in interest expense in 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to increased interest expense from the issuance of 250 million 368 senior unsecured note payable in september 2014 and lower capitalized interest of approximately 29 million during the year ended december 31 2015 resulting from lower average balances in our development pipeline the increase in 2015 was also due to an increase in interest expense relating to borrowings on our unsecured credit facility and unsecured shortterm 

borrowing facility as compared to the same period in 2014 the increase in 2015 was partially offset by the repayment of 250 million 508 senior unsecured notes payable in june 2015 and the repayment of two secured notes payable in april and september of 2014 

the decrease in interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher capitalized interest in 2014 of approximately 65 million resulting from higher average balances in our development pipeline the decrease was also due to the repayment of a secured note payable in april 2014 the repayment of a secured note payable in january 2013 and a net decrease in interest expense relating to the repayment in december 2013 of 200 million 545 senior unsecured notes payable which was partially offset by the concurrent issuance of 250 million 436 senior unsecured notes payable the decrease was also partially offset by an increase in interest expense relating to borrowings on our unsecured credit facility in 2014 as compared to 2013 and the issuance in september 2014 of 250 million 368 senior unsecured notes payable 

depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 197 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  and increased approximately 211 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions increases in capital improvements placed in service during 2014 and 2015 and the acquisition of one operating property in october 2014 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the dispositions of five operating properties in 2014 and three operating properties in 2015 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the acquisition of three operating properties during 2013 and one operating property during 2014 the increase was also due to the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions during 2013 and 2014 and increases in capital improvements placed in service during 2013 and 2014 

our deferred compensation plans recognized a benefit of approximately 03 million in 2015 and recognized expenses of approximately 39 million and 83 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively the net expense benefit for each period was related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and was directly offset by the income loss related to these plans as discussed in the nonproperty income above 

other 

  

the gain on sale of operating properties including land for the year ended december 31 2015 was due to the sale of three operating properties located in austin texas and tampa and brandon florida for a total gain on sale of operating properties of approximately 1040 million the gain was also due to the sale of two land holdings adjacent to operating properties in dallas and houston texas for a total gain on sale of land of approximately 03 million 

the gain in 2014 was due to the sale of five operating properties located in atlanta georgia dallas texas orlando and tampa florida and charlotte north carolina for a total gain on sale of operating properties of approximately 1557 million the gain was also due to the sale of approximately 293 acres located adjacent to current operating and development communities in dallas and houston texas and atlanta georgia for a total gain on sale of land of approximately 36 million the gain in 2013 was due to the sale of approximately 37 acres located adjacent to current development communities in atlanta georgia and houston texas for a total gain on sale of approximately 07 million 

the 12 million impairment associated with land holdings in 2014 reflects an impairment charge to the carrying value of a land parcel located in dallas texas the impairment charge recognized in june 2014 represented the difference between the land holdings carrying value and the fair value based upon the sales contract on this land parcel which was sold in july 2014 

equity in income of joint ventures decreased approximately 09 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  and decreased approximately 178 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  the decrease in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to a 36 million proportionate share of the gain relating to the sale of two operating properties by the funds in 2014 the decrease was partially offset by an increase in earnings resulting from our increase in ownership interest in two of the funds from 20 to 313 effective december 23 2014 the decrease was further offset by an increase in earnings resulting from higher rental income from the stabilized operating properties owned by 

the funds and two operating properties owned by the funds reaching stabilization during the third quarter of 2014 in 2014 we recognized our proportionate share of losses while these two properties were in the leaseup phase of operations 

the decrease in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily related to recognizing a 163 million proportionate share of the gain relating to the sale of 16 operating properties by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013 additionally as a result of achieving certain performance measures as set forth in the joint venture agreement we recognized a promoted equity interest of approximately 51 million related to one of these unconsolidated joint ventures the decrease was also due to the sale of two operating properties during the first quarter of 2014 the decrease in 2014 was partially offset by a 36 million proportionate gain relating to the sale of the two operating properties in the first quarter 2014 the decrease in earnings was further offset by higher rental income recognized by the stabilized operating joint venture properties during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 

funds from operations “ffo” and adjusted ffo affo 

management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate measures of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses associated with previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies 

affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reits operating performance between periods or different companies our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo and affo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

 our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 52  50 and 46 times for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses and income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations approximately 799  

795 and 776 of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 57  years at december 31 2015  

we also expect to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations other sources may include one or more of the following availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2016  including 

  

 factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing the minimum reit dividend requirements our ability to complete asset purchases sales or developments the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets 

cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  

net cash from operating activities was approximately 4232 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to approximately 4185 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  the increase was primarily due to an increase related to higher net propertylevel revenues partially offset by propertylevel expenses primarily due to the growth in revenues directly attributable to increased rental rates from our same store communities and growth in nonsame store properties primarily relating to the acquisition of one operating property in 2014 the stabilization of one operating property in 2014 and five operating properties in 2015 the completion and partial leaseup of three operating properties during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the partial leaseup of one property under construction at december 31 2015 see further discussions of our operations as compared to 2014 in results of operations these increases in net cash from operating activities were partially offset by the disposition of five operating properties in 2014 and three operating properties in 2015 the decrease was also due to an approximate 100 million onetime bonus paid to employees in 2015 relating to the restructuring of the funds in december 2014 as well as the timing of the first interest payment relating to the 250 million 368  unsecured notes issued in september 2014 which was made in the first quarter of 2015 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2015  totaled approximately 2933 million  as compared to approximately 3259 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  cash outflows for property development and capital improvements were approximately 4256 million  during 2015  as compared to approximately 5033 million  during 2014  primarily due to the completion of nine operating properties in 2014 and 2015 and the completion of repositions at several of our operating properties the property development and capital improvements during the years ended december 31 2015   and 2014  included the following 



during the year ended december 31 2015  cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of approximately 1450 million  from the sale of three operating properties and two land holdings additional cash outflows for the year ended december 31 2014  related to the acquisition of one operating property for approximately 623 million  net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2014  was partially offset by cash inflows of approximately 2377 million  from the sale of five operating properties and four land holdings in 2014 and the distributions received from our joint ventures of approximately 64 million  relating to the sale of two operating properties in february 2014 

net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately 2732 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 435 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  during 2015 we used 2500 million  to repay maturing unsecured notes payable and approximately 30 million  to pay principal amortization payments we also used approximately 2531 million  to pay distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders and approximately 95 million  to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interests in two fully consolidated joint ventures the cash flows for the year ended december 31 2015  were partially offset by proceeds net of payments from our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings of 2440 million  during 2014  we received net proceeds of approximately 2481 million  from the issuance in september 2014 of 250 million unsecured notes payable and net proceeds of approximately 662 million  from the issuance of approximately 09 million common shares from our atm program the cash inflows during 2014  were partially offset by approximately 2365 million  used for distributions paid to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders approximately 323 million  used to repay maturing secured mortgage notes payable and approximately 40 million  used for principal amortization payments 

financial flexibility 

in august 2015 we replaced our 500 million unsecured credit facility with an amended and restated facility which extended the maturity date from september 2015 to august 2019 with two sixmonth options to extend the maturity date at our election to august 2020 and increased the availability to 600 million  with the option to further increase it to 900 million by either adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of the existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate on this credit facility is based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under this credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 300 million or the remaining amount available under the credit facility this credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations on the date of this filing 

our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to 50 million  in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2015 we had approximately 2250 million  outstanding on our 600 million  credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 94 million  leaving approximately 3656 million  available under our credit facility 

in may 2015 we entered into a 40 million unsecured shortterm borrowing facility which matures in may 2016 the interest rate is based upon libor plus 105  at december 31 2015 we had approximately 190 million outstanding on this unsecured shortterm borrowing facility 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer from time to time common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares at december 31 2015  we had approximately 869 million  common shares outstanding net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements and no preferred shares outstanding 

in november 2014 we created an atm share offering program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3313 million the 2014 atm program in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us we intend to use the net proceeds from any future sales under the 2014 atm program for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowings the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development redevelopment and investment projects and financing for acquisitions as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3153 million  remaining available for sale under the 2014 atm program 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s fitch and standard and poors which are currently baa1 with positive outlook bbb with positive outlook and bbb with stable outlook respectively we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowings we believe payments on debt maturing in 2016  are manageable at approximately 190 million  which represents approximately 07 of our total outstanding debt and consists of amounts outstanding under our unsecured shortterm borrowing facility see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the eight  consolidated projects to be approximately 3101 million  of this amount we expect to incur costs between approximately 190 million and 210 million during 2016 and to incur the remaining costs during 2017 and 2018 additionally we expect to incur costs between approximately 45 million and 55 million related to the start of new development activities between approximately 19 million and 23 million of additional redevelopment expenditures and between approximately 62 million and 66 million of additional recurring capital expenditures during 2016 

we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowings proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages we evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our annual taxable income in order to minimize paying income taxes our general policy is to distribute at least 100 of our taxable income in december 2015 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of 070 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 17 2015 the dividend was subsequently paid on january 15 2016 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2015  dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 280 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2015  

in the first quarter of 2016 the companys board of trust managers increased the quarterly dividend rate from 070 to 075 per common share future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2016 our annualized dividend rate for 2016 would be 300   

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2015

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt at december 31 2015  our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately 5270 million  of which our proportionate share was approximately 1649 million  as of december 31 2015  we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation  we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting investments acquired or created are evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities “vies” which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be a vie then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate entities if we are the general partner of a limited partnership or manager of a limited liability company we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners or nonmanaging members as the case may be to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners or nonmanaging members as the case may be overcome the presumption of control by us we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined by gaap with respect to our investments occurs the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment 

asset impairment  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future discounted and undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

cost capitalization  real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development capitalized interest is generally based on the weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt expenditures directly related to the development and 

improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized we begin capitalizing development construction and carrying costs when the development of the future real estate asset is probable and activities necessary to prepare the underlying real estate for its intended use have been initiated all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities the estimates used by management require judgment and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended december 31 2015  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk derivatives are not entered into for speculative purposes 

the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2015  and 2014  prior year amounts reflect the retrospective application of our adoption of asu 201503 as supplemented by asu 201515 as more fully described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements 



we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we utilize our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings and increase our variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 1364 million the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately 45 million holding all other variables constant

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2014  we owned interests in operated or were developing 181  multifamily properties comprised of 63163  apartment homes across the united states of the 181  properties 13  properties were under construction and when completed will consist of a total of 4215  apartment homes we also own land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance  we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature the following 

  

 1 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to look for opportunities to develop and acquire existing communities we continually evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities develop 

we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity positions by generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations availability under our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atthemarket share offering program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of new leases and lease renewals achieved 

operations  we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to fifteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or land owned directly by the joint venture we currently have two discretionary investment funds the “funds” both of which are closed to future investments additionally the investors in the funds have agreed to the terms of a new fund in which our investment will be 20 for additional multifamily investments of up to 450 million including leverage of approximately 70 of the estimated value of the underlying real estate although there can be no assurance we will consummate this transaction see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present communities or any newly developed or acquired community as well as in the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2014  we had approximately 1780 employees including executive administrative and community personnel our employee headcount has historically not varied significantly throughout the year 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2014  we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate could adversely impact us  

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development activities other weakened economic conditions including job losses high unemployment levels stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

 shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents  

our apartment leases are generally for a term of fifteen months or less as these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income  

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities  

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

we could be negatively impacted by the elimination of fannie mae or freddie mac  

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily real estate we and other multifamily companies have utilized fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in may 2014 the us senate banking committee approved legislation to wind down fannie mae and freddie mac and redesign the us mortgage finance system which legislation has to date not been acted on in the broader senate a final decision by the government to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce their role in the mortgage market or otherwise restructure the us mortgage finance system may adversely affect interest rates capital availability and the development and potential sales of multifamily communities 

risks associated with our operations 

development redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability  

we intend to continue to develop redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio in 2015 we expect between approximately 250 million and 270 million will be incurred on the construction of 12 consolidated projects additionally we expect to incur between approximately 80 million and 100 million of costs related to the start of new development activities and between approximately 21 million and 25 million of additional redevelopment expenditures during 2015 our development redevelopment and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

  

 our inability to successfully implement our development redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and to assume the risk these estimates may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions 

investments through joint ventures and discretionary funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor  

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partner may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

the risks associated with our discretionary funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor include the following 

 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties  

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other multifamily reits will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected  

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including the following 

  

 tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences  

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

  

 we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage  

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets by similar types of owners we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from 

floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductible provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a catastrophic loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers and residents such uses give rise to potential cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property including residents and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations we are also expanding our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of residents potential liability and competitive disadvantage any of which could result in a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

we have significant debt which could have important adverse consequences  

as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding debt of approximately 27 billion  this indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

  

 the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders  

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including the following 

  

 6 

cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties dividend payment rates to our equity holders development redevelopment and other capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt  

we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk  

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  

moody’s fitch and standard  poors the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of baa1 with stable outlook bbb with positive outlook and bbb with stable outlook respectively on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders  

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as of december 31 2014  we owned interests in operated or were developing 181  multifamily properties comprised of 63163  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2014  reflect an increase in same store revenues of 45  as compared to 2013  we believe this increase was due to the continuation of improving economic conditions including job growth favorable demographics a manageable supply of new multifamily housing and more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the moderating level of homeownership rates all of which have resulted in higher rental rates and average occupancy levels we believe us economic and employment growth is likely to continue during the remainder of 2015  and the supply of new multifamily homes although increasing will likely remain at manageable levels if economic conditions were to worsen our operating results could be adversely affected 

construction activity 

at december 31 2014  we had a total of 13  projects under construction to be comprised of 4215  apartment homes including one development project to be comprised of 266  apartment homes owned by one of the discretionary funds the funds in which we currently have a 313 interest with initial occupancy scheduled to occur within the next 28 months excluding the projects owned by one of the funds as of december 31 2014  we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of 12  consolidated projects to be approximately 3712 million  

acquisitions 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we acquired one operating property comprised of 276  apartment homes located in atlanta georgia for approximately 626 million  we also acquired two land parcels comprised of 105 acres of land located in houston texas and rockville maryland for approximately 394 million 

fund restructuring 

in december 2014 the partnership agreements for each of the funds were amended resulting in the extension of the term of each fund to december 31 2026 in addition our ownership interests in the funds were increased from 20 to 313 effective december 23 2014 

dispositions 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we sold five operating properties comprised of 1847  apartment homes located in atlanta georgia dallas texas orlando and tampa florida and charlotte north carolina for approximately 2183 million  and we recognized a gain of approximately 1557 million  relating to these property sales we also sold four land holdings comprised of an aggregate of approximately 293 acres located adjacent to current operating and development communities in dallas and houston texas and atlanta georgia for approximately 237 million  and we recognized a gain of approximately 36 million  relating to these land sales we also recognized a 12 million impairment charge related to one of the land parcels sold in dallas texas in june 2014 which represented the difference between the land holdings carrying value and the fair value based upon the sales contract in february 2014 each of the funds sold an operating property comprised of an aggregate of 558  apartment homes one of the operating properties was located in san antonio texas and the other operating property was in houston texas our proportionate share of the gains on these two transactions was approximately 36 million  

in january 2015 we sold two operating properties comprised of 1116  apartment homes located in tampa florida and austin texas for approximately 1144 million  

future outlook 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop and acquire existing communities we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise we also intend to continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 1539 million  in cash and cash equivalents no  balances outstanding on our 500 million unsecured line of credit and as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3153 million  remaining available for sale under our 2014 atm program we believe debt maturing in 2015  is manageable at 2518 million  which represents approximately 9 of our total outstanding debt and includes scheduled principal amortizations of approximately 18 million we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover nearterm debt maturities and new development redevelopment and other capital funding requirements we will however continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements

same store analysis 

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  increased approximately 315 million  or 45  from 2013  same store rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  increased approximately 271 million or 45 from 2013  primarily due to a 40  increase in average rental rates and an increase in average occupancy for our same store portfolio from 953  in 2013  to 958  in 2014  we believe the increase to rental revenue was due to the continuation of improving economic conditions including job growth favorable demographics a manageable supply of new multifamily housing and more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the moderating level of homeownership rates all of which have resulted in higher rental rates and average occupancy levels additionally there was a 44 million increase in other property revenue during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  primarily due to increases in miscellaneous income combined with ancillary income from our utility rebilling programs 

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  increased approximately 302 million  or 51  from 2012  same store rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  increased approximately 273 million or 53 from 2012  primarily due to a 51 increase in average rental rates and a slight increase in average occupancy for our same store portfolio from 953 in 2012 to 954 in 2013 we believe the increase to rental revenue was due in part to the continuation of the improving economic conditions favorable demographics and a manageable supply of new multifamily housing additionally there was a 29 million increase in other property revenue during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  primarily due to increases in various items of miscellaneous income combined with ancillary income from our utility rebilling programs 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 97 million  or 38  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  the increase was primarily due to a 43 million or 57 increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations and property tax rates at a number of our communities the increase was also due to higher salaries and benefits primarily due to higher medical costs the increase was also due to higher utility expenses and higher repairs and maintenance costs and partially offset by a 11 million decrease in property insurance expenses due to lower selfinsured losses and premiums for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 68 million  or 31  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  the increase was due to a 65 million or 109 increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations and property tax rates at a number of our communities the increase was also due to a 25 million increase in property insurance expenses due to higher insurance premiums and claims for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 2012 these increases were partially offset by lower repairs and maintenance costs and decreased medical benefit costs 

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis 

property revenues and property expenses from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 262 million  and 107 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  these increases in revenues and expenses in our nonsame store communities for 2014  as compared to 2013  were primarily due to the acquisition of one operating property in 2014 and three operating properties in 2013 these increases were also due to revenues and expenses recognized in 2014 related to the stabilization of one operating property and 75 units at one of our consolidated operating properties in 2014 and the stabilization of three operating properties and an additional 75 units at another one of our consolidated operating properties in 2013 the increases in revenues and expenses from our development and leaseup communities for 2014  as compared to 2013  were primarily due to the completion and partial lease up of two properties in 2014 and the partial lease up of four properties which were under construction at december 31 2014 

property revenues and property expenses from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 604 million  and 225 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  these increases in 2013  as compared to 2012  were primarily due to revenues and expenses recognized in 2013  related to the acquisition of seven operating properties in 2012  the acquisition of three operating properties in 2013  and the acquisition of one previously unconsolidated joint venture community in december 2012 these increases were also due to revenues and expenses recognized in 2013  related to the stabilization of four operating properties in 2012  and three operating properties and 75 units at one of our consolidated operating properties in 2013 and increases in revenues and expenses at our other nonsame store communities 

the following table details the impact of the foregoing on our revenues and expenses 



dispositionother property analysis 

dispositionother property revenues decreased approximately 26 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and were relatively flat in 2013  as compared to 2012  the decrease in 2014  was primarily due to a 09 million decrease in revenue from dispositions due to the timing of completion of the disposition of five operating properties in 2014 the decrease was also due to a lower below market lease amortization of approximately 09 million due to the timing of completion of the acquisition of operating properties in 2012 and 2013 below market leases are generally amortized over approximately six months upon completion of an acquisition which reflects the remaining average term of acquired leases the decrease was also due to a decrease in other income of approximately 08 million for the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from our nonmultifamily rental properties 

dispositionother property expenses decreased approximately 07 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and were relatively flat in 2013  as compared to 2012  the decrease in 2014  was primarily due to lower property taxes expensed on land holdings on which we initiated development activities in the fourth quarter of 2013 as we start capitalizing expenses including property taxes on development properties at such time 

nonproperty income 

  

 not a meaningful percentage 

fee and asset management income which represents income related to property management of our joint ventures and thirdparty construction projects decreased approximately 19 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and decreased approximately 07 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  the decrease for 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to the sale of 18 operating properties by three of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013 and 2014 this decrease was also due to lower construction fees resulting from a reduced level of thirdparty construction activities and lower development and construction fees earned due to the timing of development communities started and completed by our funds during 2013 and 2014 the decrease for 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to the sale of 23 operating properties by three unconsolidated joint ventures during 2012  and 2013  and our acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture community in december 2012 this decrease was partially offset by higher construction fees due to an increase in thirdparty construction activities 

interest and other income loss decreased approximately 04 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and increased approximately 19 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  the decrease during 2014  as compared to 2013  and the increase during 2013  as compared to 2012  were primarily due to approximately 10 million recognized in the second quarter of 2013  from the release of a deed restriction on a parcel of land 

sold to an unaffiliated third party in 2006 the increase during 2013 as compared to 2012 was also due to losses of approximately 08 million recognized in 2012  relating to nondesignated derivatives 

our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately 39 million  83 million  and 48 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in the deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans as discussed below 

other expenses 

  

property management expense which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations increased approximately 09 million  for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 2013  and was relatively flat in 2013  as compared to 2012  the increase for 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses property management expenses were 27  28  and 31  of total property revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

fee and asset management expense which represents expenses related to property management of our joint ventures and thirdparty construction projects decreased approximately 04 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and decreased approximately 09 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  the decrease for 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to decreases in expenses relating to the sale of 18 operating properties by three of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013 and 2014 the decrease for 2014  as compared to 2013  was also due to lower expenses related to the timing of communities started and completed by the funds during 2013  and 2014  

the decrease in fee and asset management expense for 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to the sale of 23 operating properties by three of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2012  and 2013  and our acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture community in december 2012  the decrease was also due to lower expenses related to management of development communities due to the timing of communities started and completed by our funds during 2012  and 2013  and lower internal acquisition costs in 2013 the decrease was partially offset by higher expenses related to an increase in thirdparty construction activities during 2013  as compared to 2012  

general and administrative expenses increased approximately 104 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and increased approximately 31 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  general and administrative expenses were 60  51  and 53  of total revenues excluding income on deferred compensation plans for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to approximately 100 million in onetime bonuses paid to employees relating to the restructuring of the funds in december 2014 excluding this onetime bonus general and administrative expenses were 48 of total revenues excluding income on deferred compensation plans for the year ended december 31 2014 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses due to salary increases and higher deferred compensation amortization costs resulting from an increase in the value of awards granted in 2012 and 2013 as compared to the value of awards which vested during the year ended december 31 2012 the increase was also due to increases in professional and consulting fees of approximately 15 million and the net costs of approximately 02 million relating to the retirement of an executive officer in july 2013 

interest expense decreased approximately 49 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and decreased approximately 61 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  the decrease in interest expense in 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to higher capitalized interest in 2014 of approximately 64 million resulting from higher average balances in our development pipeline the decrease was also due to the repayment of a secured note payable in april 2014 the repayment of a secured note payable in january 2013 and a net decrease in interest expense relating to the repayment in december 2013 of 200 million 545 senior unsecured notes payable which was partially offset by the concurrent issuance of 250 million 427 senior unsecured notes payable the decrease was also partially offset by an increase in interest expense relating to borrowings on our line of credit in 2014 as compared to 2013 and the issuance in september 2014 of 250 million 359 senior unsecured notes payable 

the decrease in interest expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to the repayment of one secured and one senior unsecured notes payable in 2013 and four secured and one senior unsecured notes payable in 2012 the decrease was also due to higher capitalized interest of approximately 30 million during 2013 due to higher average balances in our development pipeline these decreases were partially offset by interest expense related to a secured note payable assumed in connection with the acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture in december 2012 the issuance of 350 million senior unsecured notes payable in december 2012 and the issuance of 250 million senior unsecured notes payable in december 2013 

depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 212 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and increased approximately 197 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the acquisition of three operating properties during 2013 and one operating property during 2014 the increase was also due to the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions during 2013 and 2014 and increases in capital improvements placed in service during 2013 and 2014 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to the acquisition of three operating properties in 2013 the acquisition of seven operating properties in 2012 and the acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture community in december 2012 the increase was also due to the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions during 2013 and an increase in capital improvements placed in service in 2012 and 2013 these increases were partially offset by lower amortization of inplace leases relating to the acquisition of nine previously unconsolidated joint venture communities in january 2012 which were amortized through july 2012 

our deferred compensation plans incurred expenses of approximately 39 million  83 million  and 48 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in the deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income related to these plans as discussed in nonproperty income above

gain on sale of operating properties including land for the year ended december 31 2014 was due to the sale of five operating properties located in atlanta georgia dallas texas orlando and tampa florida and charlotte north carolina for a total gain on sale of operating properties of approximately 1557 million the gain was also due to the sale of approximately 293 acres located adjacent to current operating and development communities in dallas and houston texas and atlanta georgia for a total gain on sale of land of approximately 36 million the gain in 2013 was due to the sale of approximately 37 acres located adjacent to current development communities in atlanta georgia and houston texas for a total gain on sale of approximately 07 million 

in january 2012 we acquired the remaining 80  ownership interests in 12 previously unconsolidated joint ventures not previously owned by us resulting in these entities being whollyowned in december 2012 we acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in another previously unconsolidated joint venture our acquisitions resulted in a gain of approximately 

574 million which represented the difference between the fair market value of our previously owned equity interests and the cost basis 

the 12 million impairment associated with land holdings in 2014 reflects an impairment charge to the carrying value of a disposed land parcel located in dallas texas which represented the difference between the land holdings carrying value and the fair value based upon the sales contract 

equity in income of joint ventures decreased approximately 178 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and increased approximately 47 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  the decrease in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily related to recognizing a 163 million proportionate share of the gain relating to the sale of 16 operating properties by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013 additionally as a result of achieving certain performance measures as set forth in the joint venture agreement we recognized a promoted equity interest of approximately 51 million related to one of these unconsolidated joint ventures the decrease was also due to the sale of two operating properties during the first quarter of 2014 the decrease in 2014 was partially offset by a 36 million proportionate gain relating to the sale of the two operating properties in the first quarter 2014 the decrease in earnings was further offset by higher rental income recognized by the stabilized operating joint venture properties during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 

the increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to recognizing a 163 million proportionate share of the gain relating to the sale of 16 operating properties by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013 additionally as a result of achieving certain performance measures as set forth in the joint venture agreement we recognized a promoted equity interest of approximately 51 million related to one of these unconsolidated joint ventures the increase was also due to an increase in earnings recognized during 2013 relating to higher rental income from the stabilized operating joint venture properties these increases were partially offset by recognizing a 174 million proportionate share of the gain relating to the sale of seven operating properties by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2012 these increases were also partially offset by our acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture in december 2012 

we had income tax expense of approximately 19 million  18 million  and 12 million  for the tax years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the 06 million  increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was due to increases in taxable income related to higher construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary and increases in state income taxes relating to certain acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2013 

funds from operations “ffo” 

management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” excluding gains or losses associated with previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

 our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 50  47 and 40 times for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations approximately 795  776 and 765 of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered at december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 63  years at december 31 2014  

we also intend to continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations other sources include availability under our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2015  including 

  

 factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing our ability to complete asset purchases sales or developments the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets 

cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  

net cash from operating activities was approximately 4185 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to approximately 4043 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  the increase was primarily due to growth in property revenues directly attributable to increased rental rates and higher occupancy from our same store communities and growth in nonsame store revenues primarily relating to the acquisition of one operating property in 2014 and three operating properties in 2013 the increase in nonsame store revenues is also related to the stabilization of one property during 2014 and three operating properties during 2013 these increases in revenues were partially offset by the increase in property expenses from our same store and nonsame store communities which include the property expenses of one operating property acquired in 2014 and three operating properties acquired in 2013 and the stabilization of one property during 2014 and three operating properties during 2013 for a further discussion of our 2014 operations as compared to 2013 see “results of operations” these increases in net cash from operating activities were partially offset by the disposition of 12 operating properties in 2013 and the timing of receipts in working capital accounts 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2014  totaled approximately 3259 million  as compared to approximately 2590 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  cash outflows for property development and capital improvements were approximately 5033 million  during 2014  as compared to approximately 3568 million  during 2013  primarily due to the addition of three development communities added in 2014 and three development communities added in the fourth quarter of 2013 the property development and capital improvements during the years ended december 31 2014   and 2013  included the following 



cash outflows during the year ended december 31 2014  also related to the acquisition of one operating property for approximately 623 million  net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2014  was partially offset by cash inflows of approximately 2377 million  from the sale of five operating properties and four land holdings in 2014 and the distributions received from our joint ventures of approximately 64 million relating to the sale of two operating properties in february 2014 additional cash outflows for the year ended december 31 2013  related to the acquisition of three operating properties for approximately 2241 million  and increases in nonreal estate assets of approximately 175 million  net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2013  was partially offset by cash inflows of 

approximately 3294 million  from the sale of 12 operating properties and two land holdings in 2013 and 113 million  from distributions from our joint ventures which included 88 million from two unconsolidated joint ventures relating to the sale of 16 operating properties in 2013 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately 435 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 1542 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  during 2014 we received net proceeds of approximately 2481 million from the issuance in september 2014 of 250 million unsecured notes payable and net proceeds of approximately 662 million from the issuance of approximately 09 million common shares from our atm program the cash inflows during 2014 were partially offset by approximately 2365 million used for distributions paid to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders approximately 323 million used to repay maturing secured mortgage notes payable approximately 40 million used for principal amortization payments and approximately 31 million of deferred financing costs during 2013 we used approximately 2261 million  to repay maturing secured and unsecured notes payable and approximately 42 million  to pay principal amortization we also used approximately 2201 million  to pay distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders the cash flows for the year ended december 31 2013  were partially offset by proceeds of approximately 2495 million  relating to the issuance in december 2013 of 250 million unsecured notes payable net proceeds of approximately 400 million  from the issuance of 06 million shares from our atm program and proceeds of approximately 25 million  from common share options exercised during the period 

financial flexibility 

we have a 500 million unsecured credit facility which matures in september 2015 with an option to extend at our election to september 2016 additionally we have the option to increase this credit facility to 750 million by either adding additional banks to the credit facility or obtaining the agreement of the existing banks in the credit facility to increase their commitments the interest rate is based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 250 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations on the date of this filing 

our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2014  we had no  shortterm balances outstanding no balances outstanding on our 500 million unsecured line of credit and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 64 million  leaving approximately 4936 million  available under our unsecured line of credit 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer from time to time common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares at december 31 2014  we had approximately 866 million  common shares outstanding net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements and no preferred shares outstanding 

in november 2014 we created an atm share offering program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3313 million the 2014 atm program in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us the net proceeds for the year ended december 31 2014  were used for general corporate purposes which included funding for development redevelopment and capital improvement projects we intend to use the net proceeds from the remaining 2014 atm program for general corporate purposes which may include reducing future borrowings under our 500 million unsecured line of credit the repayment of other indebtedness the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities funding for development redevelopment and investment projects and financing for acquisitions as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3153 million  remaining available for sale under the 2014 atm program 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s fitch and standard and poors which are currently baa1 with stable outlook bbb with positive outlook and bbb with stable outlook respectively we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit or other shortterm borrowings during the remainder of 2015  approximately 2518 million  of debt which represents approximately 9 of our total outstanding debt and includes scheduled principal amortizations of approximately 18 million is scheduled to mature see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of 12  consolidated projects to be approximately 3712 million  of this amount we expect between approximately 250 million and 270 million will be incurred during 2015 and the remaining costs will be incurred during 2016 and 2017 additionally we expect to incur between approximately 80 million and 100 million of costs related to the start of new development activities between approximately 21 million and 25 million of additional redevelopment expenditures and between approximately 61 million and 65 million of additional other capital expenditures during 2015 

we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowings proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages we evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains in december 2014 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of 066 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 17 2014 the dividend was subsequently paid on january 16 2015 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2014  dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 264 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2014  

in the first quarter of 2015 the companys board of trust managers increased the quarterly dividend rate from 066 to 070 per common share future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2015 our annualized dividend rate for 2015 would be 280   

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2014  

  



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt at december 31 2014 our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately 5236 million  of which our proportionate share was approximately 1639 million  as of december 31 2014  we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation  we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting investments acquired or created are evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities “vies” which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be a vie then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate entities if we are the general partner in a limited partnership or manager of a limited liability company we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners nonmanaging members to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined by gaap with respect to our investments occurs the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment accordingly we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 

acquisitions of real estate  upon acquisition of real estate we determine the fair value of tangible and intangible assets which includes land buildings asifvacant furniture and fixtures the value of inplace leases including above and below market leases and acquired liabilities in estimating these values we apply methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of incomeproducing property upon the acquisition of a controlling interest of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture such joint venture is consolidated and our initial equity investment is remeasured to fair value at the date the controlling interest is acquired estimates of fair value of acquired debt are based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to significant management judgment and a change in purchase price allocations could result in a material difference in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements we believe the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are critical 

asset impairment  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future discounted and undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

cost capitalization  real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs 

including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized we begin capitalizing development construction and carrying costs when the development of the future real estate asset is probable and activities necessary to get the underlying real estate ready for its intended use have been initiated all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities the estimates used by management require judgment and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended december 31 2014 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk derivatives are not entered into for speculative purposes 

the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2014  and 2013  

  



we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility and other shortterm borrowings to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility and other shortterm borrowings and increase our variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 1409 million the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately 21 million holding all other variables constant 

we have entered into and may enter into in the future interest rate swaps interest rate caps and treasury locks to protect ourselves against fluctuations in the rates of our floating rate debt or future debt issuances in connection with the repayment of the 500 million loan in june 2011 we discontinued the hedging relationship on the 500 million interest rate swap on may 31 2011 upon repayment of the loan which eliminated the probable future variable monthly interest payments being hedged we recognized a noncash charge of approximately 298 million which included the accelerated reclassification of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this swap this interest rate swap matured in october 2012 and settled the changes in fair value of this swap were marked to market through earnings in other income and other expense during 2012 we recorded a net loss of approximately 07 million related to this derivative instrument through the settlement date

financial information about segments 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as each of our communities has similar economic characteristics residents amenities and services our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment see our consolidated financial statements and notes included thereto in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for certain information required by item 1 

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2013  we owned interests in operated or were developing 184  multifamily properties comprised of 64328  apartment homes across the united states of the 184  properties 14  properties were under construction and when completed will consist of a total of 4354  apartment homes additionally we are adding a subsequent phase to a stabilized community which will consist of 75  apartment homes and we own land holdings we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance  we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature one or more of the following 

  

 subject to market conditions we intend to continue to look for opportunities to develop and acquire existing communities we continually evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities develop 

we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity positions by generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atthemarket share offering program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby increasing our operating revenues and reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of lease renewals achieved 

operations  we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to fifteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or land owned directly by the joint venture we currently have two discretionary investment funds the “funds” both of which were closed to future investment as of december 31 2013 see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as with condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present communities or any newly developed or acquired community as well as in the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2013  we had approximately 1780 employees including executive administrative and community personnel our employee headcount has historically not varied significantly throughout the year 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2013  we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact us 

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption as particularly experienced in recent years although the economy has been gradually improving there can be no assurance capital and credit markets will continue to improve in the near future in the event of renewed market disruption or volatility we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development activities other weakened economic conditions including job losses high unemployment levels stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

 shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

our apartment leases are for a term of fifteen months or less as these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities 

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which precludes our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

we could be negatively impacted by the elimination of fannie mae or freddie mac 

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily real estate we and other multifamily companies have utilized fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in june 2013 a bipartisan group of senators proposed an overhaul of the housing finance system which would wind down fannie mae and freddie mac within five years in august 2013 president obama announced his support for this legislation a final decision by the government to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce their role in the mortgage market may adversely affect interest rates capital availability and the development of multifamily communities 

compliance or failure to comply with laws including those requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act “ada” the fair housing amendments act of 1988 “fhaa” and other federal state and local laws rules and regulations generally require public accommodations and apartment homes be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features which increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further costs and obligations or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we may incur unanticipated expenses which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations to comply with ada fhaa and other federal state and local laws or in connection with lawsuits brought by the government or private litigants 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

risks associated with our operations 

development redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio with 2014 development starts expected in the range of 150 to 300 million and 2014 redevelopment expenditures in the range of 55 to 75 million our development redevelopment and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

  

 our inability to successfully implement our development redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and thirdparties including nonconsolidated subsidiaries the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and to assume the risk these estimates may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in various jurisdictions 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including the following 

  

 4 

 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties 

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other multifamily reits will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets by similar types of owners we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductible provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a catastrophic loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

investments through joint ventures and discretionary funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partner may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

the risks associated with our discretionary funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor and which as of december 31 2013 were closed for future investments include the following 

 tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

  

 we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders 

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business and our relationships with residents 

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers and our residents such uses give rise to potential cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including residents and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations we are also expanding our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of thirdparties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of residents potential liability and competitive disadvantage any of which could result in a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

litigation risks could affect our business 

as a large publiclytraded owner of multifamily properties we are at risk of becoming involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including the following 

  

 6 

 cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

we have significant debt which could have adverse consequences 

as of december 31 2013  we had outstanding debt of approximately 25 billion  this indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

  

 the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties dividend payment rates to our equity holders development redevelopment and other capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

moody’s standard  poors and fitch the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of baa1 bbb and bbb respectively each with stable outlooks on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a thirdparty were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate 

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including the following 

  

 the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing andor amount of dividends from time to time

the properties 

our properties typically consist of midrise buildings or two and three story buildings in a landscaped setting and provide residents with a variety of amenities most of the properties have one or more swimming pools and a clubhouse and many have exercise room facilities and controlledaccess gates many of the apartment homes offer additional amenities common to multifamily rental properties 

operating properties including properties held through unconsolidated joint ventures 

the 170  operating properties in which we owned interests and operated at december 31 2013  averaged 948  square feet of living area per apartment home for the year ended december 31 2013  no single operating property accounted for greater than 16  of our total revenues our operating properties had a weighted average occupancy rate of approximately 95  for each of the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  and an average annual rental revenue per apartment home of 1157  and 1045  for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively resident lease terms generally range from six to fifteen months 151  of our operating properties have over 200 apartment homes with the largest having 930  apartment homes our operating properties have an average age of 12  years calculated on the basis of investment dollars our operating properties were constructed and placed in service as follows

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development redevelopment acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as of december 31 2013  we owned interests in operated or were developing 184  multifamily properties comprising 64328  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2013  reflect an increase in rental revenue as compared to 2012  we believe this increase was primarily due to the continuation of improving economic conditions including with respect to job growth favorable demographics and a manageable supply of new multifamily housing which have resulted in increases in realized rental rates and stable average occupancy levels same store revenues increased 51  in 2013  and 65 in 2012  we believe us economic and employment growth is likely to continue during 2014  and the supply of new multifamily homes although increasing will likely remain at manageable levels however we believe significant risks to the economy remain and while there have been increases in employment levels in the majority of our markets the unemployment rate remains at higher than historical levels if economic conditions were to worsen our operating results could be adversely affected 

construction activity 

during the year ended december 31 2013  we completed construction of three development projects including one community containing 276 units owned by one of our discretionary funds in which we have a 20 ownership interest and 75 units at one of our consolidated operating properties as of december 31 2013  two of these projects reached stabilization at december 31 2013  we had a total of 14  projects under construction comprised of 4354  units including two development projects comprised of 566  units owned by one of our discretionary funds in which we have a 20 interest with initial occupancy scheduled to occur within the next 24 months additionally we are adding a subsequent phase to a stabilized community which will consist of 75  apartment homes excluding the projects owned by our discretionary funds as of december 31 2013  we estimate the additional costs to complete the construction of 13  consolidated projects to be approximately 5412 million  

acquisitions 

during the year ended december 31 2013  we acquired three operating properties comprised of 1118  apartment homes located in houston texas tempe arizona and atlanta georgia for approximately 2250 million  we also acquired three land parcels comprised of approximately 388  acres of land located in scottsdale chandler and tempe arizona for approximately 258 million  in january 2014 we acquired approximately 29  acres of land located in houston texas for approximately 156 million

same store analysis 

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  increased approximately 302 million  or 51  from 2012  same store rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  increased approximately 273 million or 53 from 2012  primarily due to a 51 increase in average rental rates and a slight increase in average occupancy for our same store portfolio from 953 in 2012 to 954 in 2013 we believe the increase to rental revenue was due in part to the continuation of the improving economic conditions favorable demographics and a manageable supply of new multifamily housing additionally there was a 29 million increase in other property revenue during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  primarily due to increases in various items of miscellaneous income combined with ancillary income from our utility rebilling programs 

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2012  increased approximately 374 million  or 65  from 2011  same store rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 increased approximately 322 million or 65 from 2011  primarily due to a 57 increase in average rental rates and a 06 increase in average occupancy for our same store portfolio we believe the increase to rental revenue was due in part to a gradually improving economy favorable demographics a modest supply of new multifamily housing and a decline in home ownership rates additionally there was a 52 million increase in other property revenue during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  primarily due to increases in revenues from ancillary income from our utility rebilling programs and miscellaneous fees and charges 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 68 million  or 31  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  the increase was due to a 65 million or 109 increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations and property tax rates at a number of our communities the increase was also due to a 25 million increase in property insurance expenses due to higher insurance premiums and claims for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 2012 these increases were partially offset by lower repairs and maintenance costs and decreased medical benefit costs 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 48 million  or 22  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the increase was primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes as a result of increasing property valuations and property tax rates at a number of our communities offset partially by refunds received on successful protests of prior year tax assessments the increase was also due to an increase in salaries and benefit expenses due to increases in salaries and incentive compensation and higher medical benefit costs 

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis 

property revenues and property expenses from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 604 million and 225 million for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  respectively the increases in 2013  as compared to 2012 were primarily due to revenues and expenses recognized in 2013  related to the acquisition of seven operating properties in 2012 the acquisition of three operating properties in 2013 and the acquisition of one previously unconsolidated joint venture community in december 2012 these increases were also due to revenues and expenses recognized in 2013 related to four operating properties reaching stabilization in 2012 and three operating properties and 75 units at one of our consolidated operating properties reaching stabilization in 2013 the remaining increases related to increases in revenues and expenses at our other nonsame store communities 

property revenue and property expenses increased approximately 605 million and 226 million for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  respectively the increases in 2012 as compared to 2011 were primarily due to increases in revenues and expenses recognized in 2012 related to the acquisition of nine previously unconsolidated joint venture communities in january 2012 and one previously unconsolidated joint venture community in december 2012 the increases in revenues and expenses were also due to revenues and expenses related to the acquisition of seven properties in 2012 four properties in our development pipeline reaching stabilization and the completion and partial leaseup of two properties in our development pipeline in 2012 

the following table details the impact in our revenues and expenses as discussed above 



other property analysis 

other property revenues were relatively flat in 2013  as compared to 2012  and increased approximately 11 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the increase in 2012  was primarily due to revenues of approximately 14 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from above and below market lease amortization related to our 2012 acquisitions 

other property expenses were relatively flat in 2013  as compared to 2012  and decreased approximately 11 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the decrease in 2012  was primarily related to decreases in property taxes expensed on four land holdings for projects which were approved during 2012  and the second half of 2011 for development activities as a result we started capitalizing expenses including property taxes on these development projects 

nonproperty income 

  

 not a meaningful percentage 

fee and asset management income decreased approximately 07 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  and increased approximately 24 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the decrease for 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to the sale of 23 operating properties by three unconsolidated joint ventures during 2012  and 2013  and our acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture community in december 2012 the decrease was partially offset by higher construction fees due to an increase in thirdparty construction activity the increase for 2012  as compared to 2011  was primarily related to an increase in property management development and construction fees due to acquisitions completed and development communities started by our funds during 2011 and 2012  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in property management fees due to our acquisition of 12 previously unconsolidated joint venture communities in january 2012 and the sale of seven operating properties by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2012  

interest and other income loss increased approximately 19 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  and decreased approximately 54 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the increase during 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to approximately 10 million recognized in the second quarter of 2013  from the release of a deed restriction on a parcel of land sold to an unaffiliated thirdparty in 2006 the increase was also due to losses of approximately 08 million recognized in 2012  relating to nondesignated derivatives the decrease during 2012  as compared to 2011  was primarily due to a 43 million gain recognized in 2011 relating to the sale of an availableforsale investment and an increase in losses recognized on nondesignated hedges of approximately 06 million during the year ended december 31 2012  

our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately 83 million  48 million  and 68 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in the deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans as discussed below 

other expenses 

  

property management expense which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations was relatively flat in 2013  as compared to 2012  and increased approximately 11 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the increase for 2012  as compared to 2011  was primarily due to higher salaries benefits and incentive compensation for our property management personnel and was partially offset by a decrease in administrative costs property management expenses were 28  31  and 35  of total property revenues for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

fee and asset management expense which represents expenses related to thirdparty construction projects and property management of our joint ventures decreased approximately 09 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  and increased approximately 07 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the decrease for 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to a decrease in expenses relating to the sale of 23 operating properties by three of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013  and 2012  and our acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture community in december 2012  the decrease was also due to lower expenses related to management of development communities due to the timing of communities started and completed by our funds during 2012  and 2013  and lower internal acquisition costs in 2013 due to the closing of the investment period for future operating properties in one of our discretionary funds during the second quarter of 2012  these decreases were partially offset by higher expenses related to an increase in thirdparty construction activity during 2013  as compared to 2012  

the increase in fee and asset management expense for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily related to an increase in expenses related to the management of acquisitions completed and development communities started by our funds during 2011 and 2012 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in expenses resulting from our acquisition of 12 previously unconsolidated joint venture communities in january 2012 and the sale of seven operating properties by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2012 

general and administrative expenses increased approximately 31 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  and increased approximately 21 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  general and administrative expenses were 51  53  and 58  of total revenues excluding income on deferred compensation plans for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses due to salary increases and higher deferred compensation amortization costs resulting from an increase in the value of awards granted in 2012 and 2013 as compared to the value of awards which were fully vested during the year ended december 31 2012  the increase was also due to increases in professional and consulting fees of approximately 15 million and the net costs of approximately 02 million relating to the retirement of an executive officer in july 2013 the increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation expenses an increase in professional fees and an increase in expensed costs related to our acquisitions completed in 2012 these increases were partially offset by approximately 21 million in onetime bonuses awarded to all nonexecutive employees in the first quarter of 2011 

interest expense decreased approximately 61 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  and decreased approximately 82 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the decrease in interest expense in 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to the repayment of one secured and one senior unsecured notes payable in 2013 and four secured and one senior unsecured notes payable in 2012 the decrease was also due to higher capitalized interest of 

approximately 30 million during 2013 due to higher average balances in our development pipeline these decreases were partially offset by interest expense related to a secured note payable assumed in connection with the acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture in december 2012 the issuance of 350 million senior unsecured notes payable in december 2012 and the issuance of 250 million senior unsecured notes payable in december 2013 

the decrease in interest expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the repayment of our 500 million term loan and two unsecured notes payable during the first half of 2011 the repayment of four secured and one senior unsecured notes payable in 2012 and higher capitalized interest of approximately 37 million as compared to 2011 due to higher average balances in our development pipeline these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our issuance of 500 million senior unsecured notes payable in june 2011 and our issuance of 350 million senior unsecured notes payable in december 2012 

depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 197 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  and increased approximately 292 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to the acquisition of three operating properties in 2013 the acquisition of seven operating properties in 2012 and the acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture community in december 2012 the increase was also due to the completion of units in our development pipeline the completion of repositions during 2013 and an increase in capital improvements placed in service in 2012 and 2013 these increases were partially offset by lower amortization of inplace leases relating to the acquisition of nine previously unconsolidated joint venture communities in january 2012 which were amortized through july 2012 the increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the acquisition of seven operating properties in 2012 and the acquisition of nine previously unconsolidated joint venture communities in january 2012 the increases were also due to the completion of units in our development pipeline and an increase in capital improvements placed in service throughout 2011 and 2012 

amortization of deferred financing costs decreased approximately 23 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the decrease for 2012 was due to lower amortization of financing costs as a result of an amendment to our 500 million credit facility in september 2011 which extended the maturity date three years the decrease was also due to lower amortization and the writeoff of approximately 05 million of unamortized loan costs associated with the repayment of the 500 million term loan in june 2011 this decrease was partially offset by higher amortization of financing costs associated with the issuance of 500 million senior unsecured notes payable in june 2011 

our deferred compensation plans incurred expenses of approximately 83 million  48 million  and 68 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in the deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income related to these plans as discussed in nonproperty income above 

other 

  

 in january 2012 we acquired the remaining 80  ownership interests in 12 previously unconsolidated joint ventures not previously owned by us resulting in these entities being whollyowned in december 2012 we acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in another previously unconsolidated joint venture our acquisitions resulted in a gain of approximately 574 million which represented the difference between the fair market value of our previously owned equity interests and the cost basis 

gain on sale of properties including land totaled approximately 07 million  and 47 million  for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2011 respectively the gain in 2013 was due to the sale of two land holdings comprised of an aggregate of approximately 37 acres located adjacent to current development communities in atlanta georgia and houston texas for approximately 66 million the gain in 2011 was due to the sale of two of our land development properties located in washington dc and austin texas to one of the funds 

gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests totaled approximately 11 million  for the year ended december 31 2011 due to the sale of our ownership interests in three unconsolidated joint ventures in march 2011 

the loss on discontinuation of hedging relationship during the year ended december 31 2011 was due to the discontinuation of a cash flow hedge associated with the repayment of our 500 million term loan in june 2011 

equity in income of joint ventures increased approximately 47 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  and increased approximately 145 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to recognizing a 163 million proportionate share of the gain relating to the sale of 16 operating properties by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013 additionally as a result of achieving certain performance measures as set forth in the joint venture agreement we recognized a promoted equity interest of approximately 51 million related to one of these unconsolidated joint ventures the increase was also due to an increase in earnings recognized during 2013 relating to higher rental income from the stabilized operating joint venture properties these increases were partially offset by recognizing a 174 million proportionate share of the gain relating to the sale of seven operating properties by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2012 these increases were also partially offset by our acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture in december 2012 

the increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to recognizing a 174 million gain relating to our proportionate share of the gain on the sale of seven operating properties by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2012 the increase was also due to an increase in earnings recognized in 2012 relating to 18 acquisitions of operating properties completed by the funds during 2011 these increases were partially offset by our acquisition of 12 previously unconsolidated joint venture communities in january 2012 these increases were further offset by recognizing a 64 million gain relating to our proportionate share of the gain on the sale of four operating properties by one of our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2011 

we had current income tax expense of approximately 18 million  12 million  and 22 million  for the tax years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the 06 million  increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was due to increases in taxable income related to higher construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary and increases in state income taxes relating to certain acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2013 the 10 million  decrease in income tax expense during 2012 as compared to 2011 was due to income taxes from the gain recognized on the sale of our availableforsale investment during the first quarter of 2011 by a taxable reit subsidiary 

funds from operations “ffo” 

management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” excluding gains or losses associated with previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to diluted ffo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

 our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 47 40 and 32 times for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations approximately 776 765 and 717 of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered at december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 69  years at december 31 2013  

we also intend to continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations other sources include availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under 

our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2014  including 

  

 factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing our ability to complete asset purchases sales or developments the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets 

cash flows 

the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 4043 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to approximately 3243 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  the increase was primarily due to growth in property revenues directly attributable to increased rental rates from our same store communities and the growth in nonsame store revenues primarily relating to the acquisition of seven operating properties in 2012 the acquisition of three operating properties in 2013 and the acquisition of one previously unconsolidated joint venture community in the fourth quarter of 2012 the increase in nonsame store revenues also related to the stabilization of four operating properties in 2012 and three operating properties in 2013 the increases in revenues were partially offset by the increase in property expenses from our same store and nonsame store communities which included the property expenses of the 10 operating properties acquired in 2012 and 2013 the previously unconsolidated joint venture acquired in 2012 and the stabilization of seven operating properties in 2012 and 2013 see further discussions of our 2013  operations as compared to 2012  in our “results of operations” the increase in net cash from operating activities was also due to changes in working capital account balances partially offset by a decrease in property revenues and expenses due to the disposition of 12 operating properties in 2013 and 11 operating properties in 2012 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2013  totaled approximately 2590 million  as compared to approximately 5277 million  used during the year ended december 31 2012  cash outflows for property development and capital improvements were approximately 3568 million  during 2013  as compared to approximately 2907 million  during 2012  due primarily to an increase in redevelopment expenditures relating to our reposition program in 2013  as compared to 2012  the property development and capital improvements during the years ended december 31 2013   and 2012  respectively included the following

cash outflows were partially offset by inflows of 2269 million  from the sale of 11 operating properties and 174 million  relating to distributions from our joint ventures which included 142 million in distributions of investments from two unconsolidated joint ventures relating to the sale of seven operating properties in 2012

financial flexibility 

we have a 500 million unsecured credit facility which matures in september 2015 with an option to extend at our election to september 2016 additionally we have the option to increase this credit facility to 750 million by either adding additional banks to the credit facility or obtaining the agreement of the existing banks in the credit facility to increase their commitments the interest rate is based upon libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 250 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations on the date of this filing 

our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2013  we had no  balances outstanding on our 500 million unsecured line of credit and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 113 million  leaving approximately 4887 million  available under our unsecured line of credit as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit from time to time we may borrow using an unsecured overnight borrowing facility our use of shortterm borrowings does not decrease the amount available under our unsecured line of credit at december 31 2013  we had no  shortterm borrowings outstanding 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer from time to time common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares 

in may 2012 we created an atm program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 300 million the “2012 atm program” in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us we intend to use the net proceeds from the 2012 atm program for general corporate purposes which may include funding for development and acquisition activities the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities reducing future borrowings under our 500 million unsecured line of credit or other shortterm borrowings and the repayment of other indebtedness the net proceeds for the year ended december 31 2013  were used for general corporate purposes which included funding for development redevelopment and capital improvement projects as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 827 million  remaining available for sale under the 2012 atm program 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s standard and poors and fitch which are currently baa1 bbb and bbb respectively each with stable outlooks as well as by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies 

however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit or other shortterm borrowings during 2014  approximately 354 million  of debt including scheduled principal amortizations of approximately 31 million  is scheduled to mature see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

we estimate the additional costs to complete the construction of 13  consolidated projects to be approximately 5412 million  of this amount we expect between approximately 360 million and 370 million will be incurred during 2014 and the remainder of the costs to be incurred during 2015 additionally we also expect to incur between approximately 55 million and 75 million of additional redevelopment expenditures and between approximately 56 million and 60 million of additional other capital expenditures during 2014 

we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through a combination of cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility or other shortterm borrowings proceeds from property dispositions the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement equity issued from our atm program other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages we evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities develop 

in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains in december 2013 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of 063 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 17 2013 the dividend was subsequently paid on january 17 2014 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2013  dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 252 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2013  

in the first quarter of 2014 the companys board of trust managers increased the quarterly dividend rate from 063 to 066 per common share future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming dividend distributions for the remainder of 2014 are similar to those declared for the first quarter 2014 the annualized dividend rate for 2014 would be 264 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2013  

  



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt at december 31 2013 our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately 5307 million of which our proportionate share was approximately 1061 million as of december 31 2013  we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation  we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated thirdparties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting investments acquired or created are evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities “vies” which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be a vie then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate entities if we are the general partner in a limited partnership or manager of a limited liability company we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners nonmanaging members to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined by gaap with respect to our investments occurs the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment accordingly we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 

acquisitions of real estate  upon acquisition of real estate we determine the fair value of tangible and intangible assets which includes land buildings asifvacant furniture and fixtures the value of inplace leases including above and below market leases and acquired liabilities in estimating these values we apply methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of incomeproducing property upon the acquisition of a controlling interest of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture such joint venture is consolidated and our initial equity investment is remeasured to fair value at the date the controlling interest is acquired estimates of fair value of acquired debt are based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to significant management judgment and a change in purchase price allocations could result in a material difference in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements we believe the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are critical 

asset impairment  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future discounted and undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

cost capitalization  real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized we begin capitalizing development construction and carrying costs when the development of the future real estate asset is probable and activities 

necessary to get the underlying real estate ready for its intended use have been initiated all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities the estimates used by management require judgment and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk derivatives are not entered into for speculative purposes 

the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2013  and 2012  

  



we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility and other shortterm borrowings to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility and other shortterm borrowings and increase our variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 1324 million the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately 21 million holding all other variables constant 

we have entered into and may enter into in the future interest rate swaps and caps to protect ourselves against fluctuations in the rates of our floating rate debt in connection with the repayment of the 500 million loan in june 2011 we discontinued the hedging relationship on the 500 million interest rate swap on may 31 2011 upon repayment of the loan which eliminated the probable future variable monthly interest payments being hedged we recognized a noncash charge of approximately 298 million which included the accelerated reclassification of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this swap this interest rate swap matured in october 2012 and settled the changes in fair value of this swap were marked to market through earnings in other income and other expense during 2012 we recorded a net loss of approximately 07 million related to this derivative instrument through the settlement date

financial information about segments 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as each of our communities has similar economic characteristics residents amenities and services our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment see our consolidated financial statements and notes included thereto in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for certain information required by item 1 

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2012  we owned interests in operated or were developing 202  multifamily properties comprising 68620  apartment homes across the united states of these 202  properties nine  properties were under development and when completed will consist of a total of 2845  apartment homes in addition we own land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance  we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations 

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature one or more of the following 

  

 subject to market conditions we intend to continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities expand our development pipeline and complete selective dispositions we have two discretionary investment funds the “funds” both of which were closed to future investment as of december 31 2012  

we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity positions by generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through cash flows generated from operations available cash balances draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atthemarket share offering program the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement and secured mortgages 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby reducing our operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to our residents and we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of lease renewals achieved 

operations  we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to fifteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to help ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or land owned directly by the joint venture see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as with condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present communities or any newly developed or acquired community as well as in the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2012  we had approximately 1825 employees including executive administrative and community personnel our employee headcount has historically not varied significantly throughout the year 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2012  we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

risks associated with capital markets credit markets and real estate 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact us 

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption as particularly experienced in the latter half of 2008 through most of 2010 during which spreads on prospective debt financings fluctuated and made it more expensive to borrow money in the event of renewed market disruption or volatility we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development pipeline other weakened economic conditions including job losses and high unemployment rates could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

  

 shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of fifteen months or less as these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities 

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which precludes our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility 

we intend to continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets which may no longer meet our investment objectives when we decide to sell an asset we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers in a timely manner as real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly especially when market conditions are poor these factors may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and may also limit our ability to utilize sales proceeds as a source of liquidity which would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt in addition the provisions of the code relating to reits limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of property unless we own the property 

through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we have held the property less than two years and this limitation may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to shareholders 

we could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac 

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily real estate we and other multifamily companies have utilized fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in february 2011 the obama administration released a report calling for the winding down of the role fannie mae and freddie mac play in the mortgage market a final decision by the government to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce their role in the mortgage market may adversely affect interest rates capital availability and the development of multifamily communities 

compliance or failure to comply with laws including those requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act “ada” the fair housing amendments act of 1988 “fhaa” and other federal state and local laws rules and regulations generally require public accommodations and apartment homes be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features which increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further costs and obligations or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we may incur unanticipated expenses which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations to comply with ada fhaa and other federal state and local laws or in connection with lawsuits brought by the government or private litigants 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

risks associated with our operations 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio with annual development starts expected in the range of 250 to 400 million our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

  

 our inability to successfully implement our development and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties including nonconsolidated subsidiaries the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and to assume the risk these estimates may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further 

trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statutes of repose in various jurisdictions 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including the following 

  

 with respect to acquisitions of operating properties we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us and may not achieve expected returns or other benefits as a result of integration challenges such as personnel and technology 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties 

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other multifamily reits will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets by similar types of owners we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductible provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a catastrophic loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

investments through joint ventures and discretionary funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partner may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

the risks associated with our discretionary funds which we manage as the general partner and advisor and which as of december 31 2012  were closed for future investments include the following 

 5 

 tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

  

 we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders perpetual preferred unit holders and noncontrolling interest holders 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology could have a negative impact to our business andor financial condition 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks a failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation andor subject us to possible financial liabilities any of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

litigation risks could affect our business 

as a large publiclytraded owner of multifamily properties we are at risk of becoming involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including the following 

  

 6 

 cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

we have significant debt which could have important adverse consequences 

as of december 31 2012  we had outstanding debt of approximately 25 billion  this indebtedness could have important consequences including 

  

 the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties dividend payment rates to our equity holders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

moody’s fitch and standard  poors the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of baa1 bbb and bbb respectively with stable stable and positive outlooks respectively on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate 

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including the following 

  

 the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing andor amount of dividends from time to time

the properties 

our properties typically consist of midrise buildings or two and three story buildings in a landscaped setting and provide residents with a variety of amenities most of the properties have one or more swimming pools and a clubhouse and many have whirlpool spas weight room facilities and controlledaccess gates many of the apartment homes offer additional amenities common to multifamily rental properties 

operating properties including properties held through unconsolidated joint ventures 

the 193  operating properties in which we owned interests and operated at december 31 2012  averaged 937  square feet of living area per apartment home for the year ended december 31 2012  no single operating property accounted for greater than 16  of our total revenues our operating properties had a weighted average occupancy rate of approximately 95   for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  and an average annual rental revenue per apartment home of 1045  and 970  for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively resident lease terms generally range from six to fifteen months 176  of our operating properties have over 200 apartment homes with the largest having 904  apartment homes our operating properties have an average age of 12  years calculated on the basis of investment dollars our operating properties were constructed and placed in service as follows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report historical results and trends which might appear in the consolidated financial statements should not be interpreted as being indicative of future operations 

we consider portions of this report to be “forwardlooking” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 both as amended with respect to our expectations for future periods forwardlooking statements do not discuss historical fact but instead include statements related to expectations projections intentions or other items relating to the future forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performances results or events although we believe the expectations reflected in our forwardlooking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance our expectations will be achieved any statements contained herein which are not statements of historical fact should be deemed forwardlooking statements reliance should not be placed on these forwardlooking statements as they are subject to known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors beyond our control and could differ materially from our actual results and performance 

factors that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those contemplated by forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

  

 20 

 these forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report and we assume no obligation to update or supplement forwardlooking statements because of subsequent events 

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as of december 31 2012  we owned interests in operated or were developing 202  multifamily properties comprising 68620  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2012  reflect an increase in rental revenue as compared to 2011  which we believe was primarily due to a gradually improving economy favorable demographics a modest supply of new multifamily housing and a decrease in home ownership rates which have resulted in increases in realized rental rates and average occupancy levels same store revenues increased 65  in 2012  following a 55 increase in 2011  we believe us economic and employment growth will continue during 2013  and the supply of new multifamily homes although increasing will continue to be below historical levels however we believe significant risks to the economy remain prevalent and while there have been increases in employment levels in the majority of our markets the unemployment rate remains at higher than historical levels if economic conditions in the united states were to worsen our operating results could be adversely affected 

development activity 

during the year ended december 31 2012  we completed construction of seven development projects including one community containing 244 units owned by one of our discretionary funds in which we have a 20 ownership interest as of december 31 2012  five of these projects reached stabilization at december 31 2012  we had a total of nine  development projects under construction containing 2845  units including two development projects containing 576  units owned by one of our discretionary funds with initial occupancy expected within the next 24 months excluding the development projects owned by one of our discretionary funds we have remaining expected costs to complete of approximately 3539 million  on the seven consolidated projects under construction as of december 31 2012  

acquisitions 

during the year ended december 31 2012  we acquired twenty operating properties in nine transactions totaling approximately 7702 million including the assumption of approximately 2988 million  in secured debt thirteen of these operating properties were owned by former unconsolidated joint ventures in which we acquired the remaining ownership interests we also acquired approximately 226  acres of land in four transactions for approximately 336 million and intend to utilize these land holdings for development of multifamily apartment communities we funded these acquisitions through cash generated from operations proceeds from our atthemarket share offering programs “atm programs” proceeds from an equity offering completed in january 2012 proceeds from a debt offering completed in december 2012 and proceeds from property dispositions 

during the year ended december 31 2012  one of our discretionary funds acquired one operating property and two land holdings totaling 187  acres which it intends to utilize for development of multifamily apartment communities 

dispositions 

during the year ended december 31 2012  we sold eleven operating properties consisting of 3213  units for approximately 2332 million and recognized a gain of approximately 1151 million  on these transactions during january 2013 we sold one operating property consisting of 770 units 

during the year ended december 31 2012  two of our unconsolidated joint ventures sold seven operating properties consisting of 2406 units for approximately 2328 million our proportionate share of the gains on these transactions was approximately 174 million  

future outlook 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to look for opportunities to expand our development pipeline and acquire existing communities we continually evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities develop we also intend to continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through cash flows generated from operations available cash balances draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions equity issued from our atm program the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement and secured mortgages 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 267 million  in cash and cash equivalents and no balances outstanding on our 500 million unsecured line of credit as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 1236 million  remaining available for sale under our atm program we believe payments on debt maturing in 2013  are manageable at 2292 million  which represents approximately 9 of our total outstanding debt and includes scheduled principal amortizations of approximately 34 million in january 2013 we repaid a 261 million secured conventional mortgage note which was scheduled to mature in april 2013 we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover nearterm debt maturities and new development funding requirements we will however continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements 

property portfolio 

our multifamily property portfolio is summarized as follows

during january 2013 we sold one operating property camden live oaks consisting of 770 apartment homes 

stabilized communities 

we generally consider a property stabilized once it reaches 90 occupancy at the beginning of a period during the year ended december 31 2012  stabilization was achieved at four recently completed consolidated development properties and one completed development property owned by one of our unconsolidated joint ventures as follows 



1 property owned through an unconsolidated joint venture in which we own a 20 interest 

development and leaseup properties 

at december 31 2012  we had two consolidated completed properties in leaseup as follows 



our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2012  included approximately 3345 million  related to properties under development and land of this amount approximately 1961 million  related to our projects currently under development in addition we had approximately 1384 million  primarily invested in land held for future development which included approximately 859 million  related to projects we expect to begin constructing during the next two years and approximately 525 million  invested in land tracts for which we may develop in the future 

communities under construction at december 31 2012  we had seven consolidated properties and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures had two properties in various stages of construction as follows 

  



 development pipeline communities  at december 31 2012  we had the following communities undergoing development activities 

  

1 represents our best estimate of the total costs we expect to incur on these projects however forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance results or events although we believe these expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

land holdings at december 31 2012  we had the following land tracts 



geographic diversification 

at december 31 2012  and 2011  our real estate assets by various markets excluding depreciation investments in joint ventures and properties held for sale were as follows 

  



results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio the leaseup of newly constructed properties acquisitions and dispositions where appropriate comparisons of income and expense for communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollarsperweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2012  increased approximately 389 million  or 65  from 2011  same store rental revenues increased approximately 336 million for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  primarily due to a 57 increase in average rental rates and a 06 increase in average occupancy for our same store portfolio from 947 in 2011 to 953 in 2012 during the year ended december 31 2012  average rental rates on new leases were 39 higher than expiring lease rates and average renewal rates were 79 higher than expiring lease rates we believe the increase to rental revenue was due in part to a gradually improving economy favorable demographics a modest supply of new multifamily housing and a decline in home ownership rates additionally there was a 53 million increase in other property revenue during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  primarily due to increases in miscellaneous fees and charges and revenues from ancillary income from our utility rebilling programs 

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2011  increased approximately 296 million  or 56  from 2010  same store rental revenues increased approximately 239 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010  primarily due to a 46 increase in average rental rates and a 07 increase in average occupancy for our same store portfolio during the year ended december 31 2011  average rental rates on new leases were 37 higher than expiring lease rates and average renewal rates were 80 higher than expiring lease rates we believe the increase to rental revenue was due in part to the continued decline in home ownership rates and the limited supply of new rental housing additionally there was a 57 million increase in other property revenue during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 2010  primarily due to increases in revenues from our utility rebilling programs and miscellaneous fees and charges 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 50 million  or 22  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2011  the increase was due to a 19 million or 3 increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations and property tax rates at a number of our communities offset partially by refunds received on successful protests of prior year tax assessments the increase was also due to a 30 million or 55 increase in salaries and benefit expenses due to increases in salaries and incentive compensation and higher medical benefit costs utility expenses including costs associated with our utility rebilling programs increased approximately 02 million during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the same period in 2011  excluding the expenses associated with our utility rebilling programs same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2012  increased approximately 47 million or 22 as compared to 2011  

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 64 million  or 31  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 2010  the increase was primarily due to increases in utility expenses relating to costs associated with our utility rebilling programs higher water costs increased salaries and benefits due to increases in annual compensation and higher medical benefit costs and higher repairs and maintenance expenses the increase was also due to slightly higher real estate taxes as a result of increasing property valuations and property tax rates at a number of our communities excluding the expenses associated with our utility rebilling programs same store property expenses for 2011  increased approximately 54 million or 28 from 2010

four properties in our development pipeline reaching stabilization and the partial leaseup of two properties in our development pipeline during 2012 the increase in 2011  as compared to 2010 was primarily due to approximately 71 million of expenses recognized during 2011  related to three joint venture communities we consolidated during the second half of 2010 and the completion and partial leaseup of two properties in our development pipeline during 2011  

other property analysis

nonproperty income

our deferred compensation plans earned income of approximately 48 million  68 million  and 116 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in the deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans as discussed below

funds from operations “ffo” 

management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” excluding gains or losses associated with previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or as compared to different companies 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to diluted ffo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

  

 our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 40 32 and 26 times for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations at december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  approximately 765 717 and 711 respectively of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 70  years at december 31 2012  

we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which are generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations other sources include available cash balances the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from dispositions equity issued from our atm program the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement and secured mortgages 

we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2013  including 

  

 factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing our ability to complete asset purchases or sales the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets 

cash flows 

certain sources and uses of cash such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures and repurchases of debt and common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon among other factors market conditions the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 3243 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to approximately 2448 million  during the year ended december 31 2011  the increase was primarily due to growth in property revenues directly attributable to increased rental and occupancy rates from our same store communities and the growth in nonsame store communities as we consolidated twelve joint ventures in the first quarter of 2012 and one unconsolidated joint venture in december 2012 the increase in nonsame store revenues also related to acquisitions of seven operating properties completed in 2012 this increase in revenues was partially offset by the increase in property expenses from our same store and nonsame store communities related to the above noted activity see further discussions of our 2012  operations as compared to 2011  in our “results of operations” 

net cash used by investing activities during the year ended december 31 2012  totaled approximately 5277 million  as compared to approximately 1874 million  during the year ended december 31 2011  cash outflows for property development and capital improvements were approximately 2907 million  during 2012  as compared to approximately 2278 million  during 2011  due primarily to an increase in construction and development activity in 2012  as compared to 2011  the property development and capital improvements during 2012  included expenditures for new development including land of approximately 1696 million  capitalized interest real estate taxes and other capitalized indirect costs of approximately 203 million  approximately 377 million  related to redevelopment expenditures and approximately 630 million  of other capital expenditures the property development and capital improvements during 2011  included expenditures for new development including land of approximately 1453 million  capitalized interest real estate taxes and other capitalized indirect costs of approximately 142 million  approximately 145 million  related to redevelopment expenditures and approximately 537 million  of other capital expenditures

net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately 1749 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 1729 million  used during the year ended december 31 2011  during 2012  we received net proceeds of approximately 6934 million  from the issuance of 112 million shares from our atm programs and through an equity offering 

completed in january 2012 cash inflows during 2012  also included proceeds of approximately 3463 million   relating to issuance of 350 million unsecured notes payable completed in december 2012 and proceeds of approximately 130 million  from common share options exercised during the period the inflow during 2012  was partially offset by approximately 2726 million used to repay the mortgage debt of twelve former joint ventures we acquired in january 2012 and 2950 million  used to repay maturing secured and unsecured notes payable cash inflows during this period were also offset by approximately 1000 million  used to redeem our perpetual preferred units and approximately 1890 million  used for distributions paid to common shareholders perpetual preferred unit holders and noncontrolling interest holders during 2011  we used approximately 6276 million  to repay our outstanding 500 million term loan and maturing secured and unsecured notes we also used approximately 1522 million  during this period for distributions paid to common shareholders perpetual preferred unit holders and noncontrolling interest holders the cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of approximately 4957 million  provided from the issuance of two series of unsecured notes completed in june 2011 net proceeds of approximately 1066 million  from the issuance of 17 million common shares under our atm programs and net proceeds of approximately 114 million  provided from common share options exercised during the period 

financial flexibility 

we have a 500 million unsecured credit facility which matures in september 2015 with an option to extend at our election to september 2016 additionally we have the option to increase this credit facility to 750 million by either adding additional banks to the credit facility or obtaining the agreement of the existing banks in the credit facility to increase their commitments the interest rate is based upon libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 250 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations 

our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2012  we had no balances outstanding on our 500 million unsecured line of credit however we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 110 million  leaving approximately 4890 million  available under our unsecured line of credit as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit from time to time we may borrow using an unsecured overnight borrowing facility our use of shortterm borrowings does not decrease the amount available under our unsecured line of credit 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec which allows us to offer from time to time an unlimited amount of common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants on may 11 2012 the shareholders of the company approved an amendment to our amended and restated declaration of trust to increase our total number of authorized shares from 1100 million to 1850 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 1750 million common shares and 100 million preferred shares 

in may 2012 we created an atm program through which we can but have no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 300 million the “2012 atm program” in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us we intend to use the net proceeds from the 2012 atm program for general corporate purposes which may include funding for development activities financing for acquisitions the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities reducing future borrowings under our 500 million unsecured line of credit and the repayment of other indebtedness as of the date of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 1236 million  remaining available for sale under the 2012 atm program 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s fitch and standard and poors which are currently baa1 bbb and bbb respectively with stable stable and positive outlooks respectively as well as by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit during 2013  approximately 2292 million  of debt including scheduled principal amortizations of approximately 34 million is scheduled to mature in january 2013 we repaid a 261 million secured third party note payable which was scheduled to mature in april 2013 see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 

we intend to incur approximately 3539 million  of additional expected costs to complete our consolidated communities under construction of this amount we expect approximately 2007 million will be incurred during 2013 and the remainder of the costs to be incurred during 2014 additionally we also expect to incur between approximately 50 million and 60 million of additional redevelopment expenditures and 60 million and 64 million of additional other capital expenditures during 2013 

we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through cash flows generated from operations available cash balances draws on our unsecured credit facility and proceeds from property dispositions we continually evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities develop we also intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through equity issued from our atm program the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement and secured mortgages 

in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains in december 2012 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of 056 per share to our common shareholders of record as of december 17 2012 the dividend was subsequently paid on january 17 2013 we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2012  dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 224 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2012  

in the first quarter of 2013 the companys board of trust managers increased the quarterly dividend rate from 056 to 063 per common share future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations the companys financial condition and capital requirements distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers assuming dividend distributions for the remainder of 2013 are similar to those declared for the first quarter 2013 the annualized dividend rate for 2013 would be 252 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2012  

  



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured third party debt as of december 31 2012  we have no outstanding guarantees related to loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

use of estimates  in the application of gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures our more significant estimates include estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets and estimates related to the valuation of our investments in joint ventures these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

principles of consolidation  we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting investments acquired or created are continuously evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities “vies” which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be a vie then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate entities if we are the general partner in a limited partnership or manager of a limited liability company we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners nonmanaging members to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined by gaap with respect to our investments occurs the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment accordingly we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 

asset impairment  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future discounted and undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which maximize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective 

in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

cost capitalization  real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized we begin capitalizing development construction and carrying costs when the development of the future real estate asset is probable and activities necessary to get the underlying real estate asset ready for its intended use have been initiated all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities the estimates used by management require judgment and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk derivatives are not entered into for speculative purposes 

the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2012  and 2011  

  



we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility and increase our variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 1403 million the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately 21 million holding all other variables constant 

we have entered into and may enter into in the future interest rate swaps and caps to protect ourselves against fluctuations in the rates of our floating rate debt in connection with the repayment of the 500 million loan in june 2011 we discontinued the hedging relationship on the 500 million interest rate swap on may 31 2011 upon repayment of the loan which eliminated the probable future variable monthly interest payments being hedged we recognized a noncash charge of approximately 298 million which included the accelerated reclassification of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this swap this interest rate swap matured in october 2012 and settled the changes in fair value of this swap were marked to market through earnings in other income and other expense during 2012 we recorded a net loss of approximately 07 million related to this derivative instrument through the settlement date

financial information about segments 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as each of our communities has similar economic characteristics residents amenities and services our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment see our consolidated financial statements and notes included thereto in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for certain information required by item 1 

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2011 we owned interests in operated or were developing 206 multifamily properties comprising 69794 apartment homes across the united states of these 206 properties ten properties were under development and when completed will consist of a total of 2797 apartment homes in addition we own land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 

operating and business strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations 

  

we try to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation these markets generally feature one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

 subject to market conditions we intend to continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities expand our development pipeline and complete selective dispositions we have two discretionary investment funds the “funds” one of which is closed to future investment and the other of which will close to future investment at the earlier of april 2012 or at such time as 90 of its committed capital is invested subject to certain exceptions 

we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity positions by generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through available cash balances the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from dispositions of property and secured mortgage notes equity issued from our 2011 atthemarket share offering program and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby reducing operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to our residents we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases occupancy levels and level of lease renewals achieved 

operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each propertys seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to fifteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to ensure timely response to residents changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or land owned directly by the joint venture see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

  

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as with condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present communities or any newly developed or acquired community as well as at the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2011 we had approximately 1885 employees including executive administrative and community personnel our employee headcount does not vary significantly throughout the year 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2011 we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

risks associated with real estate real estate capital and credit markets 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact us 

the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption as particularly experienced in the latter half of 2008 through most of 2010 during which spreads on prospective debt financings fluctuated and made it more difficult to borrow money in the event of renewed market disruption and volatility we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development pipeline other weakened economic conditions including job losses and high unemployment rates could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of fifteen months or less as these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities 

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which precludes our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income 

difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility 

we intend to continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets which may no longer meet our investment objectives when we decide to sell an asset we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers in a timely manner as real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly especially when market conditions are poor these factors may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and may also limit our ability to utilize sales proceeds as a source of liquidity which would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt in addition the provisions of the code relating to reits limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of property unless we own the property through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we have held the property less than two years and this limitation may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to shareholders 

we could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac 

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans there have been discussions of reducing or eliminating fannie mae and freddie mac and a final decision by the government to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce their acquisitions or guarantees of apartment loans may adversely affect interest rates capital availability and the development of multifamily communities 

compliance or failure to comply with laws including those requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act “ada” the fair housing amendments act of 1988 “fhaa” and other federal state and local laws rules and regulations generally require public accommodations and apartment homes be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features which increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further costs and obligations or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we may incur unanticipated expenses which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations to comply with ada fhaa and other federal state and local laws or in connection with lawsuits brought by the government or private litigants 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents realized 

  

risks associated with our operations 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio and expect increased levels of development activity in 2012 our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our inability to successfully implement our development and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and thirdparties including nonconsolidated subsidiaries the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and to assume the risk the time and costs associated with its performance may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild nonconforming work further trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statutes of repose in various jurisdictions 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

 with respect to acquisitions of operating properties we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us and may not achieve expected returns or other benefits as a result of integration challenges such as personnel and technology 

  

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties 

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other multifamily reits will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets by similar types of owners we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductible provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a catastrophic loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

investments through joint ventures involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours possess the ability to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partner may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

we face risks associated with investments in and management of discretionary funds 

we have formed the funds which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and advisor each of the funds has total capital commitments of 1875 million or 375 million in the aggregate we have committed to invest 20 of the total equity interest in each of the funds up to 75 million in the aggregate as of december 31 2011 one of the funds was closed for future investments we have contributed approximately 330 million to this fund and it had a combined equity capital investment of 1650 million at december 31 2011 as of december 31 2011 our capital contribution to the remaining open fund was approximately 237 million and it had a combined equity capital investment of approximately 1184 million there are risks associated with the investment in and management of the funds including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

 

  

  

 we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders perpetual preferred unit holders and noncontrolling interest holders 

we depend on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

changes in litigation risks could affect our business 

as a large publiclytraded owner of multifamily properties we may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including the following 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

we have significant debt which could have important adverse consequences 

as of december 31 2011 we had outstanding debt of approximately 24 billion this indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

 the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indentures under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

  

we may incur losses on interest rate hedging arrangements 

historically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with changes in interest rates and we may continue to do so in the future although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they may also reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness which is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent which the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other additionally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

moody’s and standard  poor’s the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of baa1 and bbb respectively with stable outlooks on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate 

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing andor amount of dividends from time to time

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as of december 31 2011 we owned interests in operated or were developing 206 multifamily properties comprising 69794 apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 

property operations 

our results for the year ended december 31 2011 reflect an increase in rental revenue as compared to 2010 which we believe was primarily due to a gradually improving economy favorable demographics a modest supply of new multifamily housing and a decrease in home ownership rates which have resulted in increases in realized rental rates and average occupancy levels same store revenues increased 55 as compared to 2010 we believe economic and employment conditions will improve slightly during 2012 and the supply of new multifamily homes will continue to be modest however we believe significant risks to the economy remain prevalent and while there has been a slight increase in employment levels in the majority of our markets the unemployment rate remains at higher than historical levels if economic conditions in the united states were to worsen our operating results could be adversely affected 

development activity 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we began construction on eight development projects including two development projects in our discretionary funds in which we own a 20 ownership interest the “funds” these eight projects contain 2190 units with initial occupancy expected throughout 2012 and 2013 at december 31 2011 we had a total of ten development projects under construction containing 2797 units with initial occupancy expected between 2011 and 2013 excluding the two fund development projects containing 520 units we have remaining anticipated construction expenditures of approximately 1800 million on the eight consolidated projects under construction as of december 31 2011

geographic diversification 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 our investments in various geographic areas excluding depreciation investments in joint ventures and properties held for sale were as follows 

 

 results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio the leaseup of newly constructed properties acquisitions and dispositions where appropriate comparisons of income and expense on communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollarsperweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

 

  

   

propertylevel operating results 

the following tables present the propertylevel revenues and propertylevel expenses excluding discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 and for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 

 

 same store communities are communities we owned and which were stabilized as of january 1 2010 nonsame store communities are stabilized communities we have acquired developed or redeveloped after january 1 2010 development and leaseup communities are nonstabilized communities we have acquired or developed after january 1 2010 other includes results from nonmultifamily rental properties and expenses primarily relating to land holdings not under active development 

 

 same store communities are communities we owned and which were stabilized as of january 1 2009 nonsame store communities are stabilized communities we have acquired developed or redeveloped after january 1 2009 development and leaseup communities are nonstabilized communities we have developed or acquired after january 1 2009 other includes results from nonmultifamily rental properties and expenses primarily relating to land holdings not under active development 

same store analysis 

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 increased approximately 310 million or 55 from 2010 same store rental revenues increased approximately 253 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to a 46 increase in average rental rates and a 07 increase in average occupancy for our same store portfolio during the year ended december 31 2011 average rental rates on new leases were 36 higher than expiring lease rates and average renewal rates were 79 higher than expiring lease rates we believe the increases to rental revenue were due in part to the continued decline in home ownership rates and the limited supply of new rental housing additionally there was a 57 million increase in other property revenue during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in revenues from our utility rebilling programs and miscellaneous fees and charges 

  

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased approximately 110 million or 20 from 2009 same store rental revenues decreased approximately 114 million or 24 from 2009 primarily due to a 23 decline in average rental rates partially offset by a slight increase in average occupancy the decline in average rental rates was due to the continuation of the recession through the first quarter of 2010 offset by improving rental rates and slight improvements in average occupancy levels for the last three quarters of 2010 which we believe is due in part to the continued decline in home ownership rates and the limited supply of new rental housing the decrease was also partially offset by a 04 million increase in other property revenue primarily due to increases in revenue from our utility rebilling programs 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 69 million or 30 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to increases in utility expenses relating to costs associated with our utility rebilling programs mentioned above and higher water costs increased salaries and benefits due to increases in annual compensation and higher medical benefit costs and higher repairs and maintenance expenses the increase was also due to slightly higher real estate taxes as a result of increasing property valuations and property tax rates at a number of our communities excluding the expenses associated with our rebilling programs same store property expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 increased approximately 56 million or 27 as compared to 2010 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 07 million or 03 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase was primarily due to expenses related to our utility rebilling programs discussed above higher salaries and increases in property insurance and repair and maintenance costs these increases were partially offset by lower real estate taxes as a result of declining rates and valuations at a number of our communities excluding the expenses associated with our utility rebilling programs same store property expenses for 2010 decreased approximately 10 million or 05 from 2009 

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis

other property analysis 

other property revenues increased approximately 08 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 and decreased 05 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in 2011 was primarily related to increases in rental income from our nonmultifamily rental properties as compared to 2010 the decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to lower rental income from our nonmultifamily rental properties 

other property expenses decreased approximately 10 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased 16 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 the decrease in 2011 was primarily related to decreases in property taxes expensed on land holdings for projects which were approved during 2011 and the second half of 2010 for development activities as a result we started 

  

capitalizing expenses including property taxes on these development projects the increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily related to increases in property taxes expensed on land holdings for eight projects for which we decided in 2009 to postpone development as a result we ceased capitalization of expenses including property taxes 

nonproperty income 

 

 fee and asset management income increased approximately 18 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased approximately 02 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase for 2011 was primarily due to an increase in property management development and construction fees due to acquisitions by our funds during 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010 the increase was partially offset by a decrease due to our consolidation of three joint venture communities during the second half of 2010 which were previously accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting the increase was further offset by a decrease in construction fees due to a reduction in thirdparty construction activities during 2011 as compared to 2010 

the increase in fee and asset management income for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily related to an increase in thirdparty construction activities offset by decreases in development and construction fees earned on our development joint ventures as compared to 2009 due to the completion of construction activities during 2009 and 2010 the increase was further offset by decreases in fees earned on our stabilized joint ventures due to declines in property revenues 

interest and other income decreased approximately 39 million for 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased approximately 58 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 interest income decreased approximately 12 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 and decreased approximately 09 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 the decreases were primarily due to a decline in interest income on our mezzanine loan portfolio due to lower balances of outstanding mezzanine loans due in part to the conversion of mezzanine loans into additional equity interests in certain of our joint ventures in 2010 and 2009 

other income decreased approximately 28 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased approximately 67 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 the changes between periods were due to approximately 27 million recognized in 2010 relating to the expiration of an indemnification provision in an operating joint venture agreement which expired in january 2010 and approximately 42 million recognized in 2010 as a result of the dissolution of a joint venture and purchase by our joint venture partner of the thirdparty debt made by this joint venture from the note holder which relieved us from our guarantee of our proportionate interest of this debt we had previously recorded a charge for this indemnification during the first quarter of 2011 we recognized approximately 43 million in other income from the sale of an availableforsale investment 

our deferred compensation plans earned income of approximately 68 million 116 million and 146 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in the deferred compensation plans for plan participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans as set forth in the table below 

  

other expenses 

 

 property management expense which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations increased approximately 07 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased approximately 11 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 the increases as compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to higher salaries benefits and incentive compensation for our property management personnel property management expenses were 32 33 and 31 of total property revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

fee and asset management expense which represents expenses related to thirdparty construction projects and development projects and property management of our joint venture communities increased approximately 11 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 this increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses resulting from the acquisitions completed by our funds during 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses resulting from our consolidation of three joint venture communities during the second half of 2010 which were previously accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting fee and asset management expense was relatively flat in 2010 as compared to 2009 due in part to an increase in fees earned on thirdparty construction activities offset by decreases in development and construction fees related to our development joint ventures as compared to 2009 due to the completion of construction activities during 2009 and 2010 

general and administrative expenses increased approximately 47 million during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 and decreased approximately 05 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 general and administrative expenses were 53 50 and 51 of total revenues excluding income on deferred compensation plans for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in 2011 was primarily due to awards of 21 million in onetime bonuses to all nonexecutive employees in the first quarter of 2011 and increases in salaries benefits and incentive compensation of approximately 32 million offset partially by approximately 05 million decrease in other discretionary expenses the decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in legal costs and other discretionary expenses 16 million in severance payments made in connection with a reduction in force of certain construction and development staff in january 2009 and separation costs relating to the retirement of one executive officer during the fourth quarter of 2009 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in longterm incentive compensation of approximately 16 million as compared to 2009 

the decrease in interest expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due to the retirement of unsecured notes payable during 2010 and 2011 and the repayment of our 500 million term loan in june 2011 additionally the decrease was due to higher capitalized interest of approximately 31 million as compared to 2010 primarily due to higher average balances in our development pipeline these decreases were partially offset by additional interest expense related to the issuance of 500 million in senior unsecured notes in june 2011 these decreases were also partially offset by an increase in secured notes payable relating to debt assumed in connection with the consolidation of two joint venture communities during the second half of 2010 which were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting 

the decrease in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to using the net proceeds of 2721 million from the equity offering completed during the second quarter of 2009 and approximately 2317 million in net proceeds from our atm program during 2010 to retire outstanding debt prior to its maturity of approximately 3250 million during the first six months of 2009 and repay maturing secured and unsecured notes 

  

during 2009 and 2010 as well as reduce the balances outstanding on our unsecured line of credit the decrease was partially offset by additional interest expense incurred on our 420 million credit facility entered into during the second quarter of 2009 and additional interest expense relating to secured debt assumed in connection with the consolidation of two joint venture communities during the second half of 2010 which were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting the decrease was also partially offset by lower capitalized interest of approximately 46 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to the completion of communities in our development pipeline and our decision in fiscal year 2009 to postpone the development of land holdings for eight future projects 

depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 95 million during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased approximately 15 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 the increases were primarily due to depreciation on capital improvements placed in service throughout 2011 2010 and 2009 the increases were also due to the consolidation of three joint venture communities during the second half of 2010 which were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting 

amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 18 million during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased approximately 02 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase for 2011 was due to the amortization of additional financing costs incurred on our 500 million unsecured credit facility we entered into in august 2010 and on our offering of 500 million senior unsecured notes completed in june 2011 the increase was also due to the writeoff of approximately 05 million of unamortized loan costs associated with the 500 million term loan we repaid in june 2011 the increase for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to additional financing costs incurred on our 500 million unsecured credit facility entered into in august 2010 and on our 420 million credit facility entered into the second quarter of 2009 these increases were partially offset by lower amortization of deferred financing costs related to the repurchase and retirement of certain series of notes during 2010 and 2009 

our deferred compensation plans incurred expenses of approximately 68 million 116 million and 146 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in the deferred compensation plans for plan participants and were directly offset by the income related to these plans as discussed above 

other 

 

  

 the loss on discontinuation of hedging relationship was due to the discontinuation of a cash flow hedge associated with the repayment of our 500 million term loan in june 2011 refer to note 10 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the 47 million gain on sale of properties including land in 2011 was due to a sale of one of our land development properties located in washington dc in april 2011 to one of the funds and the sale of one of our development properties located in austin texas to this fund in june 2011 the 02 million gain in 2010 was due to a gain on the sale of a land parcel in houston texas to an unaffiliated thirdparty 

  

gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests totaled approximately 11 million for the year ended december 31 2011 due to the sale of our ownership interests in three unconsolidated joint ventures in march 2011 

loss on early retirement of debt was approximately 26 million for the year ended december 31 2009 due to the repurchase and retirement of approximately 3250 million of various unsecured and secured notes from unrelated third parties for approximately 3275 million during the first two quarters of 2009 the loss on early retirement of debt for these transactions also includes reductions for the writeoff of applicable loan costs 

the impairment associated with land development activities for the year ended december 31 2009 of approximately 856 million includes approximately 722 million related to land holdings for eight projects and approximately 134 million related to a land development joint venture we put on hold these impairment charges for land are the difference between each parcel’s estimated fair value and the carrying value there were no impairments associated with land development activities for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we wroteoff a 10 million investment associated with a technology investment which we determined was no longer recoverable 

equity in income loss of joint ventures increased approximately 65 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 and decreased approximately 15 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in 2011 was primarily due to a 64 million gain recognized in equity in income loss of joint ventures relating to the sale of four operating properties by one of our unconsolidated joint ventures during the fourth quarter of 2011 the increase was also due to two development properties held by our joint ventures which were sold in march 2011 these two development properties reached stabilization in late 2010 and early 2011 and we recognized our proportionate interest in losses in 2010 during the leaseup phase of operations these increases were partially offset by our proportionate interest in overall losses recognized by the funds relating to acquisitions of operating properties during 2010 and 2011 which resulted in additional amortization expense for inplace leases over the underlying lease term the decrease for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily the result of decreases in earnings by our stabilized operating joint ventures due to declines in rental income and the recognition of net operating losses by certain development joint ventures during the leaseup phase of operations the decreases were further impacted by the consolidation of three operating joint ventures during the second half of 2010 which were previously accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting these decreases were partially offset by increases in earnings in development joint ventures reaching or nearing stabilization during 2009 and 2010 

we had current income tax expense of approximately 22 million 16 million and 10 million for the tax years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in income tax during 2011 was due to approximately 10 million associated with income taxes from the gain recognized on the sale of our availableforsale investment during the first quarter of 2011 by a taxable reit subsidiary this increase was partially offset by a decrease in taxable income related to our thirdparty construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary the increase in taxes in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily related to an increase in federal income taxes resulting from increased profitability in our thirdparty construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary 

noncontrolling interests 

 

 income allocated to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased approximately 27 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased approximately 13 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase for 2011 was primarily due to an increase in earnings from a fullyconsolidated joint venture which reached stabilization during the third quarter of 2010 of which we hold a 25 ownership the increase was also due to increased earnings associated with properties held by our operating partnerships during 2011 as compared to 2010 during 2009 we recognized an approximately 722 million impairment associated with land holdings for eight projects we had put on hold of which 36 million represented certain operating partnerships’ interests in the impairment excluding this impairment charge income allocated to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased approximately 23 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 the 23 million decrease in 2010 

  

  

as compared to 2009 was primarily due to the completion during the three months ended march 31 2010 and subsequent leaseup of a property by a fully consolidated joint venture of which we retain a 25 ownership which resulted in our recording depreciation and interest expense on the property upon completion of construction in excess of income recognized during the leaseup period the decrease was also due to lower earnings associated with properties held by operating partnerships during 2010 as compared to 2009 

funds from operations “ffo” 

management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization impairments of depreciable assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties depreciation and impairments of depreciable assets ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or as compared to different companies 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to diluted ffo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

 

  

    

liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

 

  

  

  

 our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 32 times for the year ended december 31 2011 and approximately 26 times for each of the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 approximately 717 711 and 728 respectively of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered our weighted average maturity of debt including our line of credit was 68 years at december 31 2011 

for the longer term we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity position by generating positive cash flows from operations maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations other sources include available cash balances the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2012 including 

 

  

  

  

  

 factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing our ability to complete asset sales the effect our debt level and decreases in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets 

cash flows 

certain sources and uses of cash such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures and repurchases of debt and common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon among other factors market conditions the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 2448 million during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to approximately 2240 million during the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily due to growth in property revenues directly attributable to increased rental and occupancy rates from our stabilized communities and the growth in nonstabilized communities as we consolidated three joint ventures during the second half of 2010 this increase in revenues was partially offset by the increase in property expenses from our stabilized and nonstabilized communities which include the property expenses of these three 

  

joint ventures see further discussions of our 2011 operations as compared to 2010 in our “results of operations” the increase was further offset by a decrease in net cash from operating activities due to the timing of payments in operating accounts primarily relating to the timing of payments relating to thirdparty construction activities and the timing of interest payments these decreases from operating activities were partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable receipts relating to thirdparty construction activities 

net cash used by investing activities during the year ended december 31 2011 totaled approximately 1874 million as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of approximately 352 million during the year ended december 31 2010 cash outflows for property development acquisition and capital improvements were approximately 2278 million during 2011 as compared to approximately 637 million during 2010 due primarily to an increase in construction and development activity in 2011 as compared to 2010 and the acquisitions of 301 acres of land for approximately 401 million in august 2011 and 22 acres of land for approximately 214 million in december 2011 additionally cash outflows for investments in joint ventures were approximately 460 million during the year ended december 31 2011 primarily relating to eighteen acquisitions completed by our funds in which we own a 20 interest compared to approximately 65 million for the year ended december 31 2010 these outflows were partially offset by proceeds of approximately 193 million from the sale of our interests in three unconsolidated joint ventures in march 2011 these outflows were further offset by proceeds received from the sale of our availableforsale investment of 45 million during february 2011 payments received on notes receivable from affiliates of approximately 33 million and approximately 60 million in distributions of investments from our joint ventures which included cash distributions of approximately 20 million received from an unconsolidated joint venture’s sale of operating properties in the fourth quarter of 2011 cash inflows from sales of properties including land and discontinued operations were approximately 573 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to approximately 1028 million for the year ended december 31 2010 during 2011 we received proceeds of approximately 191 million from the sale of two land development properties to one of our joint ventures and approximately 382 million from the sale of two operating properties to unaffiliated third parties during 2010 we received proceeds of approximately 1028 million from the sale of two operating properties and one land holding to unaffiliated third parties 

net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately 1729 million during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 1528 million during the year ended december 31 2010 during 2011 we used approximately 6276 million to repay our outstanding 500 million term loan in june 2011 and approximately 1276 million to retire maturing secured and unsecured notes also during 2011 approximately 1522 million was used for distributions paid to common shareholders perpetual preferred unit holders and noncontrolling interest holders during this same period net proceeds of approximately 4957 million was provided from the issuance of two series of unsecured notes completed in june 2011 and net proceeds of approximately 1066 million from the issuance of 17 million common shares under our atthemarket “atm” share offering programs which offset these cash outflows these cash outflows were further offset by proceeds from common share options exercised during the period of approximately 114 million 

financial flexibility 

in september 2011 we amended our 500 million unsecured credit facility to extend the maturity date from august 2012 to september 2015 with an option to extend to september 2016 additionally we now have the option to increase this credit facility to 750 million by either adding additional banks to the credit facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments the interest rate is based upon libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 250 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations with which we are in compliance 

our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2011 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 104 million leaving approximately 4896 million available under our unsecured line of credit 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to offer from time to time an unlimited amount of common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 1100 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 1000 million common shares and 100 million preferred shares as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 720 

  

million common shares outstanding net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements and no preferred shares outstanding in january 2012 we issued approximately 66 million common shares in a public equity offering and received approximately 3916 million in net proceeds 

in march 2010 we announced the creation of an atm share offering program through which we could but had no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 250 million “2010 atm program” in amounts and at times as we determined into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions the 2010 atm program was terminated and no further common shares are available for sale under the 2010 atm program 

in may 2011 we created a second atm share offering program through which we can sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 300 million “2011 atm program” from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions we may but have no obligation to sell common shares through the 2011 atm share offering program in amounts and at times as we determine actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for us as of the day of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 2024 million remaining available for sale under the 2011 atm program 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s and standard and poor’s which are currently baa1 and bbb respectively with stable outlooks as well as by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit during 2012 approximately 2942 million of unsecured debt including scheduled principal amortizations of approximately 35 million are scheduled to mature included in these maturities are four debt instruments of approximately 1021 million which have automatic one year extensions which we may or may not exercise at our election see note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities additionally we intend to incur approximately 1800 million of additional capital expenditures on our current development projects we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through available cash balances cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions and secured mortgage notes equity issued from our 2011 atm program and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 

in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains in december 2011 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of 049 per share to our common shareholders of record as of december 19 2011 the dividend was subsequently paid on january 17 2012 we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2011 dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 196 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2011 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2011 

 

  

   

 in january 2012 we issued approximately 66 million common shares in a public equity offering and received approximately 3916 million in net proceeds we utilized these proceeds to fund the acquisition of the 80 interest not owned by us in twelve related joint ventures for approximately 995 million and the repayment of approximately 2726 million in mortgage debt associated with these joint ventures 

in february 2012 we redeemed the 40 million outstanding 70 series b cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units at their redemption price of 2500 per unit or an aggregate of 1000 million plus accrued and unpaid distributions in connection with this redemption we expensed the unamortized issuance costs relating to these series b units which will result in a charge to earnings of approximately 21 million in the first quarter of 2012 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt as of december 31 2011 we have no outstanding guarantees related to loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

use of estimates  in the application of gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures our more significant estimates include estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets and estimates related to the valuation of our investments in joint ventures these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

principles of consolidation  we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting investments acquired or created are continuously evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities “vies” which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be a vie then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate entities if we are the general partner in a limited partnership or manager of a limited liability company we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners nonmanaging members to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined in gaap with respect to our investments occurs the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment accordingly we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 

  

asset impairment  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future discounted and undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations which maximize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective 

in addition we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

cost capitalization  real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt transaction costs associated with the acquisition of operating real estate assets are expensed and expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities the estimates used by management require judgment and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update 201104 “asu 201104” “fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs” asu 201104 requires entities to separately disclose the amounts and reasons for any transfers of assets and liabilities into and out of level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 entities will be required to disclose quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for all level 3 measurements and a description of the valuation processes in determining fair value in addition asu 201104 requires entities to provide a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of recurring level 3 measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs disclosed including the interrelationship between inputs entities will also be required to disclose information about when the current use of a nonfinancial asset measured at fair value differs from its highest and best use and the hierarchy classification for items whose fair value is not recorded on the balance sheet but is disclosed in the notes we do not anticipate changes to our existing classification and measurement of fair value when the amended standard becomes effective on january 1 2012 however we do expect our disclosures will be expanded as a result 

in june 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201105 “asu 201105” “presentation of comprehensive income” asu 201105 eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and requires all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements additionally asu 201105 requires an entity to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements from other comprehensive income to net income asu 201105 is effective for us beginning january 1 2012 we do not expect asu 201105 to have a material effect on our financial statements as we currently present other comprehensive income components in a separate but consecutive statement 

in december 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201110 “asu 201110” “property plant  equipment topic 360 derecognition of insubstance real estate  a scope clarification” asu 201110 resolves the diversity in practice about whether the guidance under fasb accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 36020 “property plant and equipment  real estate sales” applies to the derecognition of in substance real estate when a parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary as specified under asc subtopic 81010 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 51” that is in substance real estate as a result of default by the subsidiary on its nonrecourse debt the new guidance is intended to emphasize the accounting for such transactions which is based upon substance over form asu 201110 is effective for us beginning july 1 2012 and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

in december 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201112 “asu 201112” “deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu 201105” asu 201112 indefinitely defers the requirements for entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented entities will still be required to comply with the other aspects of asu 201105 as noted above asu 201112 is effective for us beginning january 1 2012 and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the table below provides information about our assets and our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

  

   

we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility and increase our variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 1196 million the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately 25 million holding all other variables constant 

we have entered into and may enter into in the future interest rate swaps and caps to protect ourselves against fluctuations in the rates of our floating rate debt in connection with the repayment of the 500 million loan in june 2011 we discontinued the hedging relationship on the 500 million interest rate swap on may 31 2011 upon repayment of the loan which eliminated the probable future variable monthly interest payments being hedged we recognized a noncash charge of approximately 298 million which included the accelerated reclassification of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this swap due to the relatively short remaining life of the swap which matures in october 2012 and the low expectation of the swap becoming a significantly larger liability management elected to leave this interest rate swap in place through its original maturity rather than cash settle the swap as a result the changes in fair value of this swap have been marked to market through earnings in other income and other expense the fair value of our interest rate swap totaled approximately 166 million as of december 31 2011 during 2011 we recorded a loss of approximately 02 million related to this derivative instrument subsequent to the discontinuation of the hedging relationship 

nondesignated derivative financial instruments could expose us to credit risk and market risk our credit risk in this context is the failure of a counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract if the fair value of a derivative contract is positive the counterparty would owe us which could create credit risk for us if the fair value of a derivative is negative we would owe the counterparty and therefore we would not be exposed to credit risk we believe we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major creditworthy financial institutions as part of our ongoing control procedures we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity thus minimizing credit risk concentration we believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty nonperformance is remote our market risk related to derivative financial instruments is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument which results from changes in interest rates we believe we minimize our market risk by monitoring the fair value of each financial instrument position

financial information about segments 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as each of our communities has similar economic characteristics residents amenities and services our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment see our consolidated financial statements and notes included thereto in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for certain information required by item 1 

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2010 we owned interests in operated or were developing 188 multifamily properties comprising 63923 apartment homes across the united states of these 188 properties two properties were under development and when completed will consist of a total of 607 apartment homes in addition we own land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 

operating strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing several properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations 

  1 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to look for opportunities to develop and acquire existing communities through our discretionary investment funds the “funds” expand our development pipeline and complete selective dispositions 

we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity positions by generating positive cash flows from operations reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through available cash balances cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions and secured mortgage notes and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby reducing operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to our residents we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases and level of lease renewals achieved 

operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each property’s seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to fifteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to ensure timely response to residents’ changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by the joint venture see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as with condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present communities or any newly developed or acquired community as well as on the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2010 we had approximately 1750 employees including executive administrative and community personnel 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2010 we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code

 item 1a   risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

risks associated with real estate real estate capital and credit markets 

volatility in capital and credit markets or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact us 

the capital and credit markets experienced volatility and disruption particularly in the latter half of 2008 through the first quarter of 2010 this caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to fluctuate and made it more difficult to borrow money in the event of renewed market disruption and volatility we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity our ability to make distributions to shareholders acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development pipeline other weakened economic conditions including job losses and high unemployment rates have adversely affected rental rates and occupancy levels unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results 

additional key economic risks which may affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of fifteen months or less as these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities 

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which precludes our developing a profitable multifamily community given the uncertainty and volatility of the current economic environment there is less market information available to us to utilize in estimating the fair value of our holdings if additional market information becomes available in future periods which impacts our estimates of fair value we may be required to take future impairment charges 

  3 

difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility 

we intend to continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets which may no longer meet our objectives when we decide to sell an asset we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers in a timely manner as real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly especially when market conditions are poor these factors may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and may also limit our ability to utilize sales proceeds as a source of liquidity which would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt in addition the provisions of the code relating to reits limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of property unless we own the property through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we have held the property less than two years and this limitation may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to shareholders 

we could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac  

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in february 2011 the obama administration released a report proposing fannie mae and freddie mac be gradually eliminated the report proposed three possible courses for longterm reform of housing finance a final decision by the government to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce their acquisitions or guarantees of apartment loans may adversely affect interest rates capital availability and the development of multifamily communities 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act “ada” the fair housing amendments act of 1988 “fhaa” and other federal state and local laws rules and regulations generally require public accommodations and apartment homes be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features which increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further costs and obligations or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we may incur unanticipated expenses which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations to comply with ada fhaa and other federal state and local laws or in connection with lawsuits brought by the government or private litigants 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents charged 

risks associated with our operations 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio and expect higher levels of development activity in 2011 as compared to recent years our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability including the following 

 

  4 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and thirdparties including nonconsolidated subsidiaries the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and to assume the risk the time and costs associated with its performance may be greater than anticipated as a result profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond this subsidiary’s control in addition the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair replace or rebuild defective work further additional trailing liabilities based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction may result from such projects and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statutes of repose in various jurisdictions 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

subject to the requirements of the funds we may acquire additional operating properties on a select basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

with respect to acquisitions of operating companies we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us or may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges such as personnel and technology 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties 

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other apartment reits will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets by similar types of owners we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductible provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

  5 

investments through joint ventures involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partner may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate finance andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

we face risks associated with investments in and management of discretionary funds 

we have formed the funds which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and advisor we have committed to invest 20 of the total equity interest in each of the funds up to 75 million in the aggregate each of the funds has total capital commitments of 1875 million or 375 million in the aggregate there are risks associated with the investment in and management of the funds including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we depend on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us

changes in litigation risks could affect our business 

as a large publiclytraded owner of multifamily properties we may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

 

 

 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains this requirement limits the cash flow available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

  7 

we have significant debt which could have important adverse consequences 

as of december 31 2010 we had outstanding debt of approximately 26 billion this indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

 

 

the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indentures under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

we may incur losses on interest rate hedging arrangements 

historically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with changes in interest rates and we may continue to do so in the future although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they may also reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness which is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent which the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other additionally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the rental and occupancy rates of our apartment properties dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

  8 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

moody’s and standard  poor’s the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of baa1 and bbb respectively with stable outlooks on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate 

the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions the risks discussed in this report and other matters including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant the board of trust managers may modify the form timing andor amount of dividends from time to time

executive summary 

we are primarily engaged in the ownership management development acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities as of december 31 2010 we owned interests in operated or were developing 188 multifamily properties comprising 63923 apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table in addition we own other land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 

the us economy has experienced a significant recession record levels of job losses and higher unemployment rates negatively impacted our business particularly in the latter half of 2008 through the first quarter of 2010 when we experienced declines in both rental rates and occupancy levels despite unemployment rates remaining at high levels our results for the most recent three quarters reflect sequential rental revenue growth as well as an increase in rental revenue growth for the three months ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to improvements in rental rates and slight improvements in average occupancy levels we believe these improvements may be due in part to the continued decline in home ownership rates and the limited supply of new rental housing we expect improvements in rental rates and occupancy to continue in 2011 and believe sustained revenue growth will depend on among other things the timing and extent of employment growth supply levels of new multifamily housing and the continuation of the decline in home ownership rates 

in 2010 we acquired three multifamily properties totaling 686 units for an aggregate of approximately 630 million on behalf of one of our discretionary investment funds in which we have a 20 ownership interest additionally we restructured three of our joint ventures which collectively own an aggregate of 1069 units resulting in our acquiring a controlling ownership interest in each joint venture 

during the second half of 2010 we began construction on two development projects comprised of approximately 607 units initial occupancy is expected in the last half of 2011 as of december 31 2010 we intend to incur approximately 572 million of additional costs on these projects we expect to fund these amounts through available cash balances and draws upon our unsecured line of credit we expect to start several additional development projects currently held in our development pipeline in 2011 and are evaluating additional development projects to commence during fiscal year 2011 and beyond 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we received net proceeds of approximately 1019 million and recognized a gain of approximately 96 million from the sale of two operating properties containing 1066 apartment homes to unaffiliated third parties 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to look for opportunities to develop and acquire existing communities through the funds expand our development pipeline and complete selective dispositions we also intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity positions by generating positive cash flows from operations reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through available cash balances cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions and secured mortgage notes and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 1706 million in cash and cash equivalents and no balances outstanding on our 500 million unsecured line of credit we have approximately 1544 million of debt maturities in 2011 excluding scheduled principal amortizations we believe we are wellpositioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover nearterm debt maturities and new development funding requirements we will however continue to assess and take further actions where prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements 

  19 

property portfolio 

our multifamily property portfolio excluding land held for future development is summarized as follows 

 

   20 

stabilized communities 

we generally consider a property stabilized once it reaches 90 occupancy at the beginning of a period during the year ended december 31 2010 stabilization was achieved at four recently completed development properties as follows 

 

 partial sales and dispositions to joint ventures included in continuing operations 

there were no partial sales or dispositions to joint ventures for the years ended december 31 2010 or 2009 

in march 2008 we sold a development community in austin texas to one of the funds for approximately 89 million no gain or loss was recognized on the sale in august 2008 we sold a stabilized community to the same fund for approximately 442 million and recognized a gain of approximately 18 million on the sale 

discontinued operations 

we intend to maintain a longterm strategy of managing our invested capital through the selective sale of properties and to utilize the proceeds to reduce our outstanding debt and leverage ratios and fund investments with higher anticipated growth prospects in our markets income from discontinued operations includes the operations of properties sold during the year ended december 31 2010 the components of earnings classified as discontinued operations include separately identifiable propertyspecific revenues expenses depreciation and interest expense if any any gain or loss on the disposal of the properties held for sale is also classified as discontinued operations 

a summary of our 2010 dispositions is as follows 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we received net proceeds of approximately 1019 million and recognized a gain of approximately 96 million from the sale of the two operating properties above containing 1066 apartment homes to unaffiliated third parties during the year ended december 31 2009 we received net proceeds of approximately 280 million and recognized a gain of approximately 169 million from the sale of one operating property containing 671 apartment homes to an unaffiliated third party during the year ended december 31 2008 we received net proceeds of approximately 1217 million and recognized gains of approximately 802 million from the sales of eight operating properties containing 2392 apartment homes to unaffiliated third parties 

  21 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized a gain of approximately 02 million from the sale of land in houston texas during the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized a gain of approximately 11 million from the sale of land adjacent to our regional office in las vegas nevada the gains on these sales were not included in discontinued operations as the operations and cash flows of these assets were not clearly distinguished operationally or for reporting purposes from the adjacent assets 

development and leaseup properties 

we did not have any consolidated properties in leaseup at december 31 2010 

at december 31 2010 we had two consolidated properties under construction as follows 

 

our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 included approximately 2069 million related to properties under development and land of this amount approximately 358 million related to our projects currently under development in addition we had approximately 1711 million primarily invested in land held for future development which includes approximately 956 million related to projects we expect to begin constructing during the next two years and approximately 755 million invested in land tracts for which we may begin developing in the future 

at december 31 2010 we had investments in unconsolidated joint ventures which were developing the following multifamily communities 

 

   22 

refer to note 8 “investments in joint ventures” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture investments 

geographic diversification 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 our investments in various geographic areas excluding both depreciation and investments in joint ventures were as follows 

 

results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio the leaseup of newly constructed properties acquisitions and dispositions where appropriate comparisons of income and expense on communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollarsperweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

 

  23 

propertylevel operating results 

the following tables present the propertylevel revenues and propertylevel expenses excluding discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 

 

same store communities are communities we owned and which were stabilized as of january 1 2009 nonsame store communities are stabilized communities we have acquired developed or redeveloped after january 1 2009 development and leaseup communities are nonstabilized communities we have acquired or developed after january 1 2009 other includes results from nonmultifamily rental properties and expenses relating to land holdings no longer under active development 

 

same store communities are communities we owned and which were stabilized as of january 1 2008 nonsame store communities are stabilized communities we have acquired developed or redeveloped after january 1 2008 development and leaseup communities are nonstabilized communities we have developed or acquired after january 1 2008 other includes results from nonmultifamily rental properties and expenses relating to land holdings no longer under active development 

same store analysis 

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased approximately 114 million or 20 from 2009 same store rental revenues decreased approximately 118 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a 23 decline in average rental rates from 2009 for our same store portfolio during 2010 partially offset by a slight increase in average occupancy the decline in average rental rates was due to the continuation of the recession through the first quarter of 2010 offset by improving rental rates and slight improvements in average occupancy levels for the most recent three quarters which we believe is due in part to the continued decline in home ownership rates and the limited supply of new rental housing the decrease was also partially offset by a 04 million increase in other property revenue primarily due to increases from our utility rebilling programs 

same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased approximately 168 million or 32 from 2008 same store rental revenues decreased approximately 239 million or 52 from 2008 due to a slight decline in average occupancy and a 50 decline in average rental rates for our same store portfolio due to among other factors the challenges within the multifamily industry resulting from a significant recession experienced within the us this decrease was partially offset by an approximate 71 million increase in other property revenue primarily due to the continued rollout of our utility rebilling programs 

  24 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 08 million or 04 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase was primarily due to expenses related to our utility rebilling programs discussed above higher salaries and increases in property insurance and repair and maintenance costs these increases were partially offset by lower real estate taxes as a result of declining rates and valuations at a number our communities excluding the expenses associated with our utility rebilling programs same store property expenses for 2010 decreased approximately 08 million or 04 from 2009 

property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 34 million or 18 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 this increase was primarily due to expenses related to our utility rebilling programs discussed above and increases in property insurance costs this increase was partially offset by lower property taxes resulting from declining rates and valuations at a number of our communities and lower repair and maintenance and marketing and leasing expenses excluding the expenses associated with our utility rebilling programs same store property expenses for 2009 declined approximately 02 million or 01 from 2008 

nonsame store and development and leaseup analysis 

property revenues from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 103 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and increased approximately 191 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 the increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to seven consolidated properties in our development and redevelopment pipelines reaching stabilization during 2009 and 2010 in addition to approximately 26 million of revenues recognized in the second half of 2010 related to three newly consolidated joint ventures as more fully described in note 7 “property acquisitions discontinued operations and impairments” the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to nine consolidated properties in our development and redevelopment pipelines reaching stabilization during 2008 and 2009 

property expenses from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 30 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and increased approximately 53 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 the increases in both periods were due to a number of consolidated properties in our development and redevelopment pipelines reaching stabilization as discussed above the increase in 2010 was also due to approximately 11 million of expenses recognized in the second half of 2010 related to three newly consolidated joint ventures as more fully described in note 7 “property acquisitions discontinued operations and impairments” 

other property analysis 

other property revenues decreased approximately 06 million and 27 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 respectively the decrease for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the sale of one of our communities to one of the funds in 2008 

other property expenses increased approximately 16 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 respectively the increases in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily related to increases in property taxes expensed on land holdings for eight projects for which we decided in 2009 to postpone development as a result we ceased capitalization of expenses including property taxes the decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to costs we incurred related to hurricane ike in september 2008 

  25 

nonproperty income 

 

 fee and asset management income which represents income related to asset management thirdparty construction and development projects and property management increased approximately 02 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased approximately 12 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 the increase for 2010 was primarily related to an increase in thirdparty construction activities offset by decreases in development and construction fees earned on our development joint ventures as compared to 2009 due to the completion of construction activities during 2009 and 2010 the increase was further offset by decreases in fees earned on our stabilized joint ventures due to declines in property revenues the decrease for 2009 was primarily related to overall declines in development and construction fees earned on our development joint ventures in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to the completion of the associated construction activities at several joint venture communities in 2008 and 2009 the decrease in 2009 was partially offset by an increase in thirdparty construction activities in 2009 

interest and other income increased approximately 58 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased approximately 19 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 the increase for 2010 was primarily due to the recognition of approximately 27 million of other income resulting from indemnification provisions in an operating joint venture agreement which expired in january 2010 and recognition of approximately 42 million of other income as a result of the dissolution of a joint venture and purchase by our joint venture partner of the thirdparty debt made by this joint venture from the note holder which relieved us from our guarantee of our proportionate interest of this debt we had previously recorded a charge for this indemnification these increases were partially offset by an approximate 09 million decrease in interest income due to declines in interest income on our mezzanine loan portfolio related primarily to the lower balances of outstanding mezzanine loans due in part to conversion of mezzanine loans into additional equity interests in certain of our joint ventures in 2009 and 2010 

the 19 million decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to declines in interest income on our mezzanine loan portfolio related to contractual reductions in interest rates reductions in interest earned on certain variable rate mezzanine notes due to declines in libor and lower balances of outstanding mezzanine loans due in part to the conversion of mezzanine loans into additional equity interests in certain of our joint ventures in 2009 

our deferred compensation plans earned income of approximately 116 million and 146 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively and incurred losses of 334 million in 2008 the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in the deferred compensation plans for plan participants and were directly offset by the expense benefit related to these plans as set forth in the table below 

  26 

other expenses 

 

property management expense which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations increased approximately 11 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased approximately 10 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 property management expenses were 33 31 and 33 of total property revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the 11 million increase in 2010 was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits rental marketing and travel expenses as compared to 2009 the decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 was due primarily to lower travel and legal expenses 

fee and asset management expense which represents expenses related to asset management thirdparty construction and development projects and property management was relatively flat in 2010 as compared to 2009 due in part to an increase in thirdparty construction activities offset by decreases in development and construction on our development joint ventures as compared to 2009 due to the completion of construction activities during 2009 and 2010 the 12 million decrease for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to declines in development and construction activities related to our development joint ventures in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to the completion of the associated construction activities at several joint venture communities in 2008 and 2009 

general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 05 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased approximately 03 million during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 general and administrative expenses were 49 of total revenues excluding income or loss on deferred compensation plans for the year ended december 31 2010 and 50 for each of the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 the decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in legal costs and other discretionary expenses 16 million in severance payments made in connection with a reduction in force of certain construction and development staff in january 2009 and separation costs relating to the retirement of one executive officer during the fourth quarter of 2009 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in longterm incentive compensation of approximately 16 million during 2010 as compared to 2009 the decrease for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to various costsaving initiatives implemented in 2009 and increased expenses in 2008 which did not recur in 2009 associated with the abandonment of potential acquisitions the decrease was partially offset by 16 million in severance payments made in connection with the reduction in force of certain construction and development staff in 2009 and separation costs relating to the retirement of one executive officer during the fourth quarter of 2009 

interest expense decreased approximately 24 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased approximately 41 million during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease in 2010 was primarily due to using the net proceeds of 2721 million from the equity offering completed during the second quarter of 2009 and approximately 2317 million in net proceeds from our atm program during 2010 to retire outstanding debt prior to its maturity of approximately 3250 million during the first six months of 2009 and repay maturing secured and unsecured notes during 2009 and 2010 as well as reduce the balances outstanding on our unsecured line of credit this decrease was partially offset by the increased interest expense incurred on our 420 million credit facility entered into during the second quarter of 2009 and lower capitalized interest of approximately 46 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to the completion of communities in our development pipeline and our decision in fiscal year 2009 to postpone the development of land holdings for eight future projects

the decrease for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to decreases in indebtedness as a result of early retirement of outstanding debt of approximately 3250 million during the first six months of 2009 this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest of approximately 74 million during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 as a result of the completion of units in our development pipeline and our decision in fiscal year 2008 not to continue with five future development projects the decrease was further offset by higher interest rates on existing indebtedness resulting from paying down amounts outstanding under our unsecured line of credit with proceeds from our 420 million credit facility entered into in april 2009 and our 380 million credit facility entered into in september 2008 

depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 15 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and increased approximately 28 million during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 the increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to new development and capital improvements placed in service during 2009 and 2010 and the consolidation of three joint ventures during the second half of 2010 which were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting these increases were partially offset by an increase in the number of assets being fully depreciated in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to completion of new development and capital improvements placed in service in 2009 as compared to the previous year 

amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately 02 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and increased approximately 10 million during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 the increase for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to additional financing costs incurred on our 500 million unsecured credit facility entered into in august 2010 and on our 420 million credit facility entered into the second quarter of 2009 these increases were partially offset by lower amortization of deferred financing costs related to the repurchase and retirement of certain series of notes during 2010 and 2009 the increase for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the amortization of our financing costs incurred upon the extension of our unsecured credit facility in october 2009 and financing costs related to our 380 million credit facility completed in september 2008 and our 420 million credit facility completed in april 2009 this increase was partially offset by the repurchase and retirement of certain series of notes during 2009 

our deferred compensation plans incurred expenses of approximately 116 million and 146 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively and earned a benefit of approximately 334 million in 2008 the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in the deferred compensation plans for plan participants and were directly offset by the income loss related to these plans as discussed above 

other 

 

gain on sale of properties including land totaled approximately 02 million and 29 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and december 31 2008 respectively the gain in 2008 was due to the partial sale of properties to one of the funds and a gain on the sale of a land parcel in las vegas nevada to an unaffiliated third party there was no gain on sale of properties including land for the year ended december 31 2009 

  28 

loss on early retirement of debt was approximately 26 million for the year ended december 31 2009 due to the repurchase and retirement of approximately 3250 million of various unsecured and secured notes from unrelated third parties for approximately 3275 million during the first two quarters of 2009 gain on early retirement of debt was approximately 136 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due to the repurchases and retirements of debt including a tender offer for certain series of outstanding debt which resulted in the repurchase and retirement of approximately 1083 million of debt from unrelated third parties for approximately 1006 million and the repurchases and retirements of approximately 827 million of various series of other outstanding debt from unrelated third parties for approximately 757 million the gain loss on early retirement of debt for these transactions also includes reductions for the writeoff of applicable loan costs there was no gain loss on early retirement of debt for the year ended december 31 2010 

the impairment associated with land development activities for the year ended december 31 2009 of approximately 856 million includes approximately 722 million related to land holdings for eight projects and approximately 134 million related to a land development joint venture we put on hold the impairment associated with land development activities for the year ended december 31 2008 of approximately 513 million reflects impairments in the value of land holdings for several potential development projects including approximately 486 million related to land holdings for five projects approximately 16 million in the value of a land parcel held for future development and approximately 11 million for costs capitalized for a potential joint venture development we did not develop these impairment charges for land are the difference between each parcel’s estimated fair value and the carrying value there were no impairments associated with land development activities for the year ended december 31 2010 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we wroteoff a 10 million investment associated with a technology investment which we determined was no longer recoverable 

equity in income loss of joint ventures decreased approximately 15 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 and increased approximately 20 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily the result of decreases in earnings by our stabilized operating joint ventures due to declines in rental income and the recognition of net operating losses by certain development joint ventures during the leaseup phase of operations the decreases were further impacted by the consolidation of three operating joint ventures during the second half of 2010 which were previously accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting these decreases were partially offset by increases in earnings in development joint ventures reaching or nearing stabilization during 2009 and 2010 the increase for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily the result of certain properties owned by development joint ventures reaching or nearing stabilization in 2009 partially offset by declining earnings at our stabilized operating joint ventures due to declines in rental income 

we had current income tax expense of approximately 16 million 10 million and 08 million for the tax years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in taxes in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily related to an increase in federal income taxes resulting from increased profitability in our construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary the increase in taxes in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily related to an increase in state income taxes 

noncontrolling interests 

 

income allocated to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased approximately 13 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased 45 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 during 2009 we recognized an approximately 722 million impairment associated with land holdings for eight projects we had put on hold of which 36 million represented certain operating partnerships’ interests of the impairment excluding this impairment charge income allocated to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased approximately 23 million and 08 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 and 2009 as compared to 2008 respectively the 23 million decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to the completion during the three months ended march 31 2010 and subsequent leaseup of a property by a fully consolidated joint venture of which we retain a 25 ownership which resulted in our recording depreciation and interest expense on the property upon completion of construction in excess of income recognized during the leaseup period the decrease was also due to lower earnings associated with properties held by operating partnerships during 2010 as compared to 2009 the 08 million decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower earnings associated with properties held by operating partnerships during 2009 as compared to 2008

funds from operations “ffo” 

management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to diluted ffo for the years ended december 31 are as follows

liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

 

 

 

our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 26 times for each of the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 our interest expense coverage ratio is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation amortization and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 711 728 and 783 respectively of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered our weighted average maturity of debt including our line of credit was 55 years at december 31 2010 

for the longer term we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity position by generating positive cash flows from operations reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios and controlling overhead costs 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations other sources include available cash balances the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments secured mortgage debt and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2011 including 

 

 

 

 

 

factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing our ability to complete asset sales the effect our debt level and decreases in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets 

cash flows 

certain sources and uses of cash such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures and repurchases of debt and common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon among other factors market conditions the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 2240 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to approximately 2177 million during the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily due to lower interest expense and changes in operating accounts the increase was partially offset by declines in property net operating income in 2010 as compared to 2009 

net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december 31 2010 totaled approximately 352 million as compared to net cash used by investing activities of approximately 695 million during the year ended december 31 2009 cash outflows for property development acquisition and capital improvements were approximately 637 million during 2010 as compared to approximately 728 million during 2009 this decrease was due to the timing of completions of communities in our development pipeline and a reduction in construction and development activity in 2010 as compared to 2009 cash inflows from sales of properties including land and discontinued operations were approximately 1028 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to approximately 281 million for the year ended december 31 2009 additionally cash outflows for investments in joint ventures were 65 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 232 million in 2009 the decrease in cash outflows for investments in joint ventures in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily a result of our 222 million equity investment in one of our joint ventures during the third quarter 2009 

  31 

net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately 1528 million during the year ended december 31 2010 primarily as a result of the repayment of maturing outstanding unsecured notes payable of approximately 1376 million repayment of approximately 1656 million of secured notes assumed in connection with obtaining controlling interests in three joint ventures and distributions paid to common shareholders perpetual preferred unit holders and noncontrolling interest holders of approximately 1356 million the cash outflows were partially offset by cash receipts of approximately 2317 million relating to proceeds received from the sale of approximately 49 million common shares throughout fiscal year 2010 under our atm share offering program cash outflows were further offset by decreases in accounts receivable from affiliates of approximately 42 million relating to proceeds received from participant withdrawals from our deferred compensation plans and approximately 530 million for proceeds received from secured notes payable relating to a secured credit agreement for a newly consolidated joint venture and 47 million for advances under a construction loan for one of our communities completing construction during 2010 net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately 914 million during the year ended december 31 2009 during the year ended december 31 2009 we used a total of approximately 6487 million of cash to repay outstanding notes payable consisting of approximately 1699 million of outstanding notes payable stemming from our april 2009 tender offer the early retirement of outstanding debt consisting of approximately 1391 million of secured notes and approximately 182 million of senior unsecured notes the remaining outstanding notes payable payments were primarily for maturing secured and unsecured notes payable of approximately 1765 million and payments of all remaining amounts outstanding on our unsecured line of credit also in 2009 1527 million was used for distributions paid to common shareholders perpetual preferred unit holders and noncontrolling interest holders the cash outflows were offset by cash receipts of 420 million from a secured credit facility entered into during the second quarter approximately 208 million of cash receipts from secured notes relating to a construction loan for a consolidated joint venture and net proceeds of approximately 2721 million from the completion of our equity offering in may 2009 

financial flexibility 

in august 2010 we entered into a 500 million unsecured credit facility with the option to increase this credit facility to 600 million which matures in august 2012 and may be extended at our option to august 2013 this facility replaces our 600 million unsecured credit facility which was scheduled to mature in january 2011 interest rate spreads float on a margin based on libor and are subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 250 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations all of which we are in compliance 

our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2010 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 102 million leaving approximately 4898 million available under our unsecured line of credit 

we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to offer from time to time an unlimited amount of common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 110 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 100 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 696 million common shares outstanding net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements and no preferred shares outstanding 

in march 2010 we announced the creation of our atm share offering program through which we may but have no obligation to sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 250 million in amounts and at times as we determine into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including among others market conditions the trading price of our common shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for us as of the day of this filing we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 107 million remaining under the atm program 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s and standard and poor’s which are currently baa1 and bbb respectively with stable outlooks as well as by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks fannie mae freddie mac or life insurance companies however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

  32 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit during 2011 approximately 1544 million of unsecured debt excluding scheduled principal amortizations are scheduled to mature see note 9 “notes payable” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities additionally we intend to incur approximately 572 million of additional capital expenditures on our current development projects and we expect to fund these amounts through available cash balances and draws on our unsecured line of credit we intend to meet our nearterm liquidity requirements through available cash balances cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions and secured mortgage notes and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 

in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains in december 2010 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of 045 per share to our common shareholders of record as of december 20 2010 the dividend was subsequently paid on january 18 2011 we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2010 dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 180 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2010 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2010 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt we have guaranteed no more than our proportionate interest totaling approximately 110 million of two loans utilized for construction and development activities for our joint ventures we are also committed to additional funding under a mezzanine loan provided to one joint venture and our commitment to fund additional amounts under this mezzanine loan was an aggregate of approximately 60 million at december 31 2010 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  33 

use of estimates in the application of gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures our more significant estimates include estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets estimates related to the valuation of our investments in joint ventures and estimates and assumptions used to determine the entity with the power to direct activities that most significantly impacts economic performance of variable interest entities these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

principles of consolidation  we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting investments acquired or created are continuously evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities “vies” which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be a vie then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate entities if we are the general partner in a limited partnership or manager of a limited liability company we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners nonmanaging members to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined in gaap with respect to our investments occurs the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment accordingly we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 

asset impairment  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future discounted and undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations that maximize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective 

in addition we evaluate our investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment we will record an impairment charge 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to among other factors the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses and the fact limited market information regarding the value of comparable land exists at this time it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges would have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

cost capitalization real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt transaction costs associated with the acquisition of real estate assets are expensed expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively included in capitalized costs are management’s estimates of indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities the estimates used by management require judgment and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the table below provides information about our assets and our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility thereby increasing our variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 946 million the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt excluding debt effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements described below would be approximately 23 million holding all other variables constant we currently use interest rate hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable indebtedness not for trading or speculative purposes under the hedge agreements 

 

 

as of december 31 2010 the effect of our hedge agreements was to fix the interest rate on approximately 5166 million of our variable rate debt had the hedge agreements not been in place during 2010 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 233 million lower based on balances and reported interest rates through the year as the variable interest rates were less than the effective interest rates on the associated hedge agreements additionally if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher through 2010 and the hedge agreements not been in place our annual interest cost would have been approximately 58 million higher derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements we believe we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major creditworthy financial institutions as part of our ongoing control procedures we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity thus minimizing credit risk concentration we believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty nonperformance is remote

financial information about segments 

we are engaged in the ownership development construction and management of multifamily apartment communities as each of our communities has similar economic characteristics residents amenities and services our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment see our consolidated financial statements and notes included thereto in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for certain information required by item 1 

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2009 we owned interests in operated or were developing 185 multifamily properties comprising 63658 apartment homes across the united states we had 372 apartment homes under development at two of our multifamily properties including 119 apartment homes at one multifamily property owned through a nonconsolidated joint venture and 253 apartment homes at one multifamily property owned through a consolidated joint venture in which we own an interest in addition we own other land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 

operating strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us maximize the earnings potential of our communities 

real estate investments and market balance we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

we have historically focused our operating strategy on capturing greater market share selectively disposing of properties and redeploying capital in new multifamily communities while also maintaining a strong balance sheet we have also historically evaluated acquisition opportunities as they arose some of which were consummated and contributed to our growth and profitability 

  1 

we continue to operate in our core markets which we believe provides an advantage due to economies of scale we believe where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing several properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations 

during 2008 and 2009 a number of factors adversely affecting demand for and rents received by our multifamily communities were intense and pervasive across the united states and the conditions within the multifamily industry have become progressively more challenging a prolonged recession high inventory levels of singlefamily homes and condominiums in the markets in which we operate overall weak consumer confidence and high unemployment among other factors have persisted and in some cases accelerated in 2009 we believe the effects of these factors on the multifamily industry have been further magnified by high levels of home foreclosures liquidity disruptions in the financial markets continued job losses and a lack of job growth our average apartment lease term is approximately twelve months the impact of an economic downturn affects us quickly due to the shortterm nature of our leases because our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

based on these market conditions and our belief these conditions will continue in the near future we are cautious regarding expected performance and expect a decline in property revenues during 2010 as compared to 2009 however positive impacts on our performance may result from reductions in the us home ownership rate more stringent lending criteria for prospective homebuyers and longterm growth prospects for population employment and household formations in our markets however there can be no assurance any of these factors will develop continue or positively impact our operating results we have noted a recent increase in issuances of debt and equity by reits at more attractive rates while this may be a positive sign we are uncertain if this level of activity will increase or continue 

during the near term we plan to continue to focus primarily on strengthening our capital and liquidity position by generating positive cash flows from operations reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios and controlling and reducing overhead costs 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of our discretionary investment funds the camden multifamily value add fund lp and a related coinvestment partnership the “funds” until the earlier of i december 31 2011 or ii such time as 90 of their committed capital is invested subject to two oneyear extensions the funds will be our exclusive investment vehicles for acquiring fully developed multifamily properties subject to certain exceptions 

sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby reducing operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to our residents we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases and level of lease renewals achieved 

operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property financial results we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each property’s seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to fifteen months with an average lease of twelve months and with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to ensure timely response to residents’ changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

  2 

investments in joint ventures we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by the joint venture see note 7 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our communities in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as with condominiums and singlefamily homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our communities are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present communities or any newly developed or acquired community as well as on the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2009 we had approximately 1750 employees including executive administrative and community personnel 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2009 we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we continue to meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks please note additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

risks associated with real estate real estate capital and credit markets 

volatility in capital and credit markets could adversely impact us 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption which has caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to fluctuate and potentially make it more difficult to borrow money if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to shareholders this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity generally which have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us including our ability to acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development pipeline 

we could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac 

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in september 2008 the us government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency in december 2009 the obama administration pledged to cover unlimited losses through 2012 for both companies lifting an earlier cap of 400 billion since that time the chairman of the house financial services committee has called for a new system for providing money for mortgages and the elimination of fannie mae and freddie mac a decision by the government to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce their acquisitions or guarantees of apartment loans may adversely affect interest rates capital availability and the development of multifamily communities governmental actions could also make it easier for individuals to finance loans for singlefamily homes which would make renting a less attractive option and adversely affect our occupancy or rental rates 

  3 

unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact occupancy or rental rates 

weakened economic conditions including decreased job growth and job losses have affected and continue to significantly affect apartment home occupancy and rental rates significant decreases in occupancy or rental rates in the markets in which we operate in turn may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results the risks which may affect conditions in these markets include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may experience a decrease in rental revenues an increase in operating expenses or a combination of both which may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities 

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate as a result of changing market conditions in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced margins in a poorly performing project as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to recover fully or upon which we cannot build and develop a profitable multifamily community under current market conditions in 2009 we recorded impairment charges on land holdings for eight developments and a land development joint venture we have put on hold for the foreseeable future we may have future impairments of our land and related activities these impairment charges are based on estimates of fair value given the current environment the amount of market information available to estimate fair value is less than usual if additional market information becomes available in future periods we may take additional impairment charges in the future 

difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility 

we intend to evaluate the potential disposition of assets that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell an asset we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers in a timely manner as real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly especially when market conditions are poor these difficulties have been exacerbated in the current credit environment because buyers have experienced difficulty in obtaining the necessary financing these factors may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and may also limit our ability to utilize sales proceeds as a source of liquidity which would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt in addition in order to maintain our status as a reit the code imposes restrictions on our ability to sell properties held fewer than two years which may cause us to incur losses thereby reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt 

  4 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act “ada” the fair housing amendments act of 1988 “fhaa” and other federal state and local laws generally require public accommodations and apartment homes be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features which increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we may incur unanticipated expenses which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations to comply with ada fhaa and other federal state and local laws or in connection with lawsuits brought by the government or private litigants 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents charged 

risks associated with our operations 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

although we expect lower levels of development activity in 2010 as compared to prior years in the long term we intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we also serve as the general contractor on a limited number of development and construction projects for properties owned by unrelated third parties pursuant to guaranteed maximum price contracts the terms of these contracts require us to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and we assume the risk that the time and costs associated with our performance may be greater than was anticipated as a result our profitability on guaranteed maximum price contracts is dependent on our ability to accurately predict these factors the time and costs may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond our control in addition the terms of these contracts generally require a warranty period which may have durations of up to ten years during which we may be required to repair replace or rebuild a project in the event of a material defect 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

subject to the requirements of the funds we may acquire additional operating properties on a select basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

 

  5 

 

 

 

with respect to acquisitions of operating companies we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us or may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges such as personnel and technology 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties 

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other apartment reits will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductible provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

investments through joint ventures involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures these investments involve risks including the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations we and our joint venture partner may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our joint venture partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

we face risks associated with investments in and management of discretionary funds 

we have formed the funds which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and advisor we have committed to invest 20 of the total equity interest in each of the funds up to 75 million in the aggregate as of december 31 2009 each of the funds had total capital commitments of 1875 million or 375 million in the aggregate there are risks associated with the investment in and management of the funds including the following 

 

 

 

 

  6 

 

 

 

 

we depend on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business 

as a large publiclytraded owner of multifamily properties we may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

 

 

 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  7 

 

cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains this requirement limits the cash flow available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

we have significant debt which could have important adverse consequences 

as of december 31 2009 we had outstanding debt of approximately 26 billion this indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

 

 

the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indentures under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

we may incur losses on interest rate hedging arrangements 

historically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with changes in interest rates and we may continue to do so in the future although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they may also reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness which is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent which the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other additionally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks 

issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated if we issue more debt we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

  8 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

moody’s and standard  poor’s the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of baa1 and bbb respectively with stable outlooks on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings in light of the difficulties in the real estate industry and the volatile financial markets we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

our share price will fluctuate 

stock markets in general and our common shares have experienced continued price volatility over the past year the market price and volume of our common shares may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to the risk factors discussed in this report and the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may reduce dividends on our equity securities 

on december 7 2009 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a fourth quarter dividend of 045 per common share totaling 205 per share for the year ended december 31 2009 in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains however in the event of among other factors continued material future deterioration in business conditions or continuing tightening in the credit markets our board of trust managers may decide to reduce our dividend while ensuring compliance with the requirements of the code related to reit qualification

executive summary 

during 2008 and 2009 a number of factors adversely affecting the demand for and rents received by our multifamily communities were intense and pervasive across the united states and the conditions within the multifamily industry have become progressively more challenging a prolonged recession high inventory levels of singlefamily homes and condominiums in the markets in which we operate overall weak consumer confidence and high unemployment among other factors have persisted and in some cases accelerated in 2009 we believe the effects of these factors on the multifamily industry have been further magnified by high levels of home foreclosures liquidity disruptions in the financial markets continued job losses and lack of job growth our average apartment lease term is approximately twelve months the impact of an economic downturn affects us quickly due to the shortterm nature of our leases because our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

based on these market conditions and our belief these conditions will continue in the near future we are cautious regarding expected performance and expect a decline in property revenues during 2010 as compared to 2009 however positive impacts on our performance may result from reductions in the us home ownership rate more stringent lending criteria for prospective homebuyers and longterm growth prospects for population employment and household formations in our markets although there can be no assurance any of these factors will develop continue or positively impact our operating results we have noted a recent increase in issuances of debt and equity by reits at more attractive rates while this may be a positive sign we are uncertain if this level of activity will increase or continue 

during the near term we plan to continue to primarily focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity position by generating positive cash flows from operations reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios and controlling and reducing overhead costs 

we review our longlived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable our impairment evaluations take into consideration the current and anticipated economic climate based on our evaluations we recorded significant impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2009 for land holdings for eight future projects and a land development joint venture we have put on hold for the foreseeable future 

we currently have five whollyowned land parcels held for future development we plan to develop however the commencement of future developments may continue to be impacted by macroeconomic issues multifamily market conditions and other factors we will continue to evaluate future development starts based on market economic and capital market conditions however if current conditions persist there can be no assurance we will not have further impairments in the future 

subject to market conditions we intend to continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of our funds until the earlier of i december 31 2011 or ii such time as 90 of their committed capital is invested subject to two oneyear extensions the funds will be our exclusive investment vehicles for acquiring fully developed multifamily properties subject to certain exceptions

property portfolio 

our multifamily property portfolio excluding land and joint venture properties which we do not manage is summarized as follows 

 

   20 

stabilized communities 

we generally consider a property stabilized when 90 occupancy is achieved at the beginning of a period during the year ended december 31 2009 stabilization was achieved at seven recently completed development properties as follows 

 

partial sales and dispositions to joint ventures included in continuing operations 

there were no partial sales or dispositions to joint ventures for the years ended december 31 2009 or 2007 

in march 2008 we sold camden amber oaks a development community in austin texas to one of the funds for approximately 89 million no gain or loss was recognized on the sale concurrent with the transaction we invested approximately 19 million in the fund in august 2008 we sold camden south congress to the same fund for approximately 442 million and recognized a gain of approximately 18 million on the sale in conjunction with the transaction we invested approximately 28 million in the fund

funds from operations “ffo” 

management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including certain noncontrolling interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 

to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to diluted ffo for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

 

 liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by

our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was approximately 26 26 and 30 times for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our interest expense coverage ratio is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses income from discontinued operations depreciation amortization and interest expense at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 728 783 and 816 respectively of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered our weighted average maturity of debt including our line of credit was 56 years at december 31 2009 

due to the instability experienced during the current economic downturn we believe the timing and strength of an economic recovery is unclear and these conditions may not improve quickly we plan to continue to primarily focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity position by generating positive cash flows from operations reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios selectively disposing of properties when feasible and controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations other sources include the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings secured mortgage debt proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments and access to the capital markets we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2010 including 

 

 

 

 

 

factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to current volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing our ability to complete asset sales the effect our debt level and decreases in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets and changes in operating costs resulting from a weakened economy all of which could adversely impact occupancy and rental rates and our liquidity 

cash flows 

certain sources and uses of cash such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures and repurchases of debt and common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon among other factors market conditions the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 2177 million during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to approximately 2170 during the year ended december 31 2008 the slight increase was primarily due to lower interest expense offset by lower net operating income in 2009 as compared to 2008 and the timing of payments relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2009 totaled approximately 695 million as compared to approximately 374 million during the year ended december 31 2008 cash outflows for property development acquisition and capital improvements were approximately 728 million during 2009 as compared to approximately 1993 million during 2008 this decrease was due to the timing of completions of communities in our development pipeline and a reduction in construction and development activity in 2009 as compared to 2008 cash inflows from sales of properties and partial sales of assets to joint ventures were approximately 281 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to approximately 1760 million for the year ended december 31 2008 additionally cash outflows for investments in joint ventures were 232 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 104 million in 2008 this increase in cash outflows was primarily a result of our 222 million equity investment in one of our joint ventures during the third quarter 2009 

  31 

net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately 914 million during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to approximately 1731 million during 2008 during the year ended december 31 2009 we used a total of approximately 6487 million of cash to repay outstanding notes payable consisting of approximately 1699 million of outstanding notes payable stemming from our april 2009 tender offer the early retirement of outstanding debt consisting of approximately 1391 million of secured notes and approximately 182 million of senior unsecured notes the remaining outstanding notes payable payments were primarily for maturing secured and unsecured notes payable of approximately 1765 million and payments of all remaining amounts outstanding on our unsecured line of credit also in 2009 1527 million was used for distributions paid to common shareholders perpetual preferred unit holders and noncontrolling interest holders the cash outflows were offset by cash receipts of 420 million from a secured credit facility entered into during the second quarter approximately 208 million from secured notes payable relating to a construction loan for a consolidated joint venture and net proceeds of approximately 2721 million from the completion of our equity offering in may 2009 in 2008 we used 1731 million of cash in financing activities primarily to repay approximately 3792 million of outstanding notes payable consisting of approximately 1006 million of outstanding notes payable in our december 2008 tender offer approximately 757 million of various series of other outstanding debt and approximately 2019 million of maturing secured notes payable net cash used in financing activities for 2008 was also attributable to distributions paid to common shareholders perpetual preferred unit holders and noncontrolling interest holders of approximately 1723 million and approximately 331 million of common share repurchases offset by proceeds from notes payable and increases in our unsecured line of credit of approximately 3859 million and 300 million respectively 

financial flexibility 

we have a 600 million unsecured credit facility which matures in january 2011 the scheduled interest rate is based on spreads over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the prime rate the scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of 300 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations all of which we are in compliance 

our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2009 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 92 million and had approximately 5908 million available under our unsecured line of credit 

as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit from time to time we may borrow using competitively bid unsecured shortterm notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group we expect such borrowings if any will vary in term and pricing and will typically be priced at interest rates below those available from the unsecured line of credit 

during the quarter ended june 30 2009 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which became automatically effective upon filing and allows us to offer from time to time an unlimited amount of common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 110 million shares of beneficial interest consisting of 100 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares during the quarter ended june 30 2009 we issued approximately 104 million common shares at 2750 per share in a public equity offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately 2721 million as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 770 million common shares and no preferred shares outstanding 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s and standard and poor’s which are currently baa1 and bbb respectively with stable outlooks as well as by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from fannie mae or freddie mac however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future the capital and credit markets have been experiencing continued volatility and disruption we have noted a recent increase in issuances of debt and equity by reits at more attractive rates while this may be a positive sign we are uncertain if this level of activity will increase or continue if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all 

  32 

on april 17 2009 we as guarantor and five separate subsidiaries as borrowers entered into a 420 million secured credit facility agreement the facility has a tenyear term with a fixed annual interest rate of 512 and monthly payments of interest only and matures on may 1 2019 we have entered into standard nonrecourse carveout guarantees the obligations of the borrowers under the credit agreement are secured by crosscollateralized first priority mortgages on 11 of our multifamily communities we used the proceeds from this credit facility to repurchase outstanding debt repay maturing debt prepay mortgage debt pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit and general corporate purposes 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit during 2010 approximately 1416 million of unsecured debt including scheduled principal amortizations are scheduled to mature see note 9 “notes payable” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities additionally approximately 95 million remains to be funded for one development project owned by a consolidated joint venture and we expect substantially all of the remaining expenditures to be funded from an existing construction loan we intend to meet our longterm liquidity requirements through cash flows generated from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility proceeds from property dispositions and secured mortgage notes and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 

in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains in december 2009 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of 045 per share to our common shareholders of record as of december 21 2009 the dividend was subsequently paid on january 18 2010 we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units when aggregated with previous 2009 dividends this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of 205 per share or unit for the year ended december 31 2009 

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt we are also committed to additional funding under mezzanine loans provided to joint ventures we have guaranteed no more than our proportionate interest totaling approximately 570 million of five loans utilized for construction and development activities for our joint ventures and our commitment to fund additional amounts under the mezzanine loans was an aggregate of approximately 73 million at december 31 2009 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases we believe the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

use of estimates in the application of gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures our more significant estimates include estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets estimates of the useful lives of our assets estimates related to the valuation of our investments in joint ventures and mezzanine financing and estimates of expected losses of variable interest entities these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

principles of consolidation  we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting investments acquired or created are evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities “vies” which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be a vie then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate if we are the general partner in a limited partnership or manager of a limited liability company we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners or nonmanaging members as the case may be to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners or nonmanaging members as the case may be overcome the presumption of control by us we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined in gaap with respect to our investments occurs the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment accordingly we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 

asset impairment  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets we consider projected future discounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its fair value while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding a number of factors including market rents economic conditions and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates and discounted cash flow calculations that maximize inputs from a marketplace participant’s perspective during the quarter ended december 31 2009 we recognized a 722 million impairment charge to the previous carrying value of 1099 million for land holdings for eight future projects we have put on hold for the foreseeable future additionally we recognized a 134 million impairment charge relating to a land development joint venture we have put on hold for the foreseeable future this development joint venture had a previous carrying value of approximately 89 million the impairment also included exit costs associated with this joint venture the estimates of fair value are based on what we believe to be marketplace participant expectations and consider among other things the highest and best use of the land for example as a multifamily development or singlefamily townhome construction estimated timeframe and current estimates of construction and development costs estimates of expected market rents and expenses upon completion of development expected leaseup periods and expected net operating income or yield that a marketplace participant would expect to receive from the developed project we utilized opinions of value from thirdparties to supplement our estimates there were no significant marketbased transactions that have occurred during the previous twelve months for the land parcels that were analyzed 

in addition we evaluate our investments in joint ventures and mezzanine construction financing and if with respect to investments we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value or if with respect to mezzanine loans it is probable we will not collect all scheduled amounts due in accordance with the terms we will record an impairment charge based on these evaluations in general we provide mezzanine loans to affiliated joint ventures constructing or operating multifamily assets while we believe it is currently probable we will collect all scheduled amounts due with respect to these mezzanine loans current market conditions with respect to credit markets and real estate market fundamentals inject a significant amount of uncertainty into the environment and any further adverse economic or market development may cause us to reevaluate our conclusions and could result in material impairment charges with respect to our mezzanine loans 

  34 

the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to among other factors the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses and the fact limited market information regarding the value of comparable land exists at this time it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions deteriorate beyond our current expectations or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such material noncash charges would have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

cost capitalization real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average unsecured interest rate most transaction and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition of real estate assets are expensed expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively included in capitalized costs are management’s estimates of indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities the estimates used by management require judgment and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

recent accounting pronouncements in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued the codification effective july 1 2009 the codification is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap we adopted the codification during the third quarter of 2009 and the adoption did not materially impact our financial statements however our references to accounting literature within our notes to the consolidated financial statements have been revised to conform to the codification classification 

in august 2009 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 200905 which provides alternatives to measuring the fair value of liabilities when a quoted price for an identical liability traded in an active market does not exist the alternatives include using the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset or the quoted price of a similar liability or of a similar liability when traded as an asset in addition to valuation techniques based on the amount an entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or receive to enter into an identical liability we adopted asu 200905 effective october 1 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in december 2009 the fasb issued asu 200916 “ transfers and servicing topic 860 — accounting for transfers of financial assets” which codified the previously issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 166 “ accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 140 ” asu 200916 modifies the financial components approach removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and clarifies and amends the derecognition criteria for determining whether a transfer of a financial asset or portion of a financial asset qualifies for sale accounting the asu also requires expanded disclosures regarding transferred assets and how they affect the reporting entity asu 200916 is effective for us beginning january 1 2010 our adoption of asu 200916 will not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  35 

in december 2009 the fasb issued asu 200917 “consolidations topic 810 — improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities” which codified the previously issued sfas 167 “ amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” asu 200917 changes the consolidation analysis for vies and requires a qualitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of the vie the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie is based on whether the entity has the power to direct matters which most significantly impact the activities of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie the asu requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary and also amends the events triggering a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie asu 200917 requires additional disclosures for vies including disclosures about a reporting entity’s involvement with vies how a reporting entity’s involvement with a vie affects the reporting entity’s financial statements and significant judgments and assumptions made by the reporting entity to determine whether it must consolidate the vie asu 200917 is effective for us beginning january 1 2010 our adoption of asu 200917 will not have a material effect on our financial statements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu 201001 “equity topic 505 accounting for distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash” the asu clarifies when the stock portion of a distribution allows shareholders to elect to receive cash or stock with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash which all shareholders could elect to receive in the aggregate the distribution would be considered a share issuance as opposed to a stock dividend and the share issuance would be reflected in earnings per share prospectively we adopted asu 201001 effective october 1 2009 and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial statements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu 201002 “consolidation topic 810 accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary — a scope clarification” the asu clarifies the scope of subtopic 81010 applies to a subsidiary or group of assets considered to be a business or nonprofit activity a subsidiary considered to be a business or nonprofit activity which is transferred to an equity method investee or joint venture and an exchange of a group of assets considered to be a business or nonprofit activity for a noncontrolling interest in an entity including an equity method investee or joint venture asu 201002 further clarifies the scope of subtopic 81010 does not apply to sales of in substance real estate or conveyances of oil and gas mineral rights even if these transfers involve businesses the asu also expands the disclosure requirements about deconsolidation of a subsidiary or derecognition of a group of assets for entities who have previously adopted the noncontrolling interests guidance included in subtopic 81010 asu 2010 is effective for interim or annual periods ending on or after december 15 2009 and should be applied retrospectively to the first period in which the noncontrolling interests guidance was adopted as we adopted the noncontrolling interests guidance on january 1 2009 we also adopted asu 201002 effective january 1 2009 and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the table below provides information about our assets and our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility thereby increasing our variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

  36 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 1007 million the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt excluding debt effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements described below would be approximately 22 million holding all other variables constant we currently use interest rate hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable indebtedness not for trading or speculative purposes under the hedge agreements 

 

 

as of december 31 2009 the effect of our hedge agreements was to fix the interest rate on approximately 5149 million of our variable rate debt had the hedge agreements not been in place during 2009 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 226 million lower based on balances and reported interest rates through the year as the variable interest rates were less than the effective interest rates on the associated hedge agreements additionally if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher through 2009 and the hedge agreements not been in place our annual interest cost would have been approximately 54 million higher derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements we believe we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major creditworthy financial institutions as part of our ongoing control procedures we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity thus minimizing credit risk concentration we believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty nonperformance is remote

financial information about segments 

we are engaged in the ownership development construction and management of multifamily apartment communities as each of our apartment communities has similar economic characteristics residents and products and services our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment see our consolidated financial statements and notes included thereto in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for certain information required by item 1 

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2008 we owned interests in operated or were developing 186 multifamily properties comprising 64329 apartment homes across the united states we had 1426 apartment homes under development at five of our multifamily properties including 1060 apartment homes at four multifamily properties owned through joint ventures in which we own an interest in addition to other sites we may develop into multifamily apartment communities additionally one property comprised of 671 apartment homes was designated as held for sale 

operating strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to help us to produce earnings growth 

real estate investments and market balance we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure should allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to enhance our strategy of having a geographically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

  1 

we have historically focused our operating strategy on capturing greater market share selectively disposing of properties and redeploying capital in new multifamily communities while also maintaining a strong balance sheet we have also actively evaluated acquisition opportunities as they arose some of which were consummated and contributed to our growth and profitability 

we continue to operate in our core markets in which we believe we have an advantage due to economies of scale we feel where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing several properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating sustained earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital for various strategic reasons including if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations 

due to weakness and unpredictability in the capital and credit markets and real estate fundamentals we believe our revenues may decline in 2009 as compared to 2008 although we believe our business and longterm fundamentals which support increased revenues such as population growth remain strong and the current difficult conditions will moderate over time the timing of an economic recovery is unclear and these conditions may not improve quickly consequently our nearterm primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by selectively disposing of properties controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs generating positive cash flows from operations and reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios while we expect development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long term we expect decreasing levels of development activity in 2009 as compared to prior years please review the “risk factors” section for a further discussion of the potential impact on us of current economic conditions 

we believe the current economic downturn may provide us with opportunities to acquire selective multifamily assets at attractive valuations in certain instances such acquisitions may provide us with benefits we would not be able to achieve by developing our own multifamily communities such as the avoidance of incurring development or construction expenses we intend to seek to limit the risks associated with such acquisitions by targeting those opportunities we believe will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we had the final closing of our discretionary investment vehicle camden multifamily value add fund lp the “fund” followed by the final closing of a coinvestment limited partnership the “coinvestment vehicle” and together with the fund the “funds” in the second quarter of 2008 during the investment period ending no later than december 2011 the funds will be our exclusive vehicles for acquiring apartment communities subject to certain exceptions over the next several years we expect to increase our acquisition activity through the funds focusing on communities that can benefit from redevelopment repositioning or market cycle opportunities please review the “risk factors” section for a discussion of risks associated with acquisitions and the funds 

sophisticated property management we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and retain residents thereby reducing operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to our residents we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon property operational results rental rate increases and level of lease renewals achieved 

operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property net operating income we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each property’s seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to fifteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to ensure timely response to residents’ changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

  2 

investments in joint ventures we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures or partnerships including limited liability companies through which we own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by the joint venture or partnership see note 7 “investments in joint ventures” and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in joint ventures 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2008 we had approximately 1800 employees including executive administrative and community personnel 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2008 we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks please note additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

risks associated with real estate real estate capital and credit markets 

volatility in capital and credit markets could adversely impact us 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption which has caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably and made it more difficult to borrow money if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to shareholders this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity generally which have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us including our ability to acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development pipeline 

we could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac  

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing apartment loans in september 2008 the us government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the recently created federal housing finance agency the us government has not determined which of fannie mae’s and freddie mac’s businesses to retain and which to dissolve a decision by the government to reduce fannie mae’s or freddie mac’s acquisitions of apartment loans could adversely affect interest rates capital availability and the development of multifamily communities governmental actions could also make it easier for individuals to finance loans for singlefamily homes which would make renting a less attractive option and adversely affect our occupancy or rental rates 

  3 

unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact occupancy or rental rates 

weakened economic conditions including decreased job growth and job losses have affected and continue to significantly affect apartment home occupancy and rental rates significant decreases in occupancy or rental rates in the markets in which we operate in turn may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results the risks which may affect conditions in these markets include the following 

 

we may experience a decrease in rental revenues an increase in operating expenses or a combination of both which may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to pay distributions to shareholders 

we face risks associated with land holdings 

we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in owning or purchasing and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate as a result of changing market conditions in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced margins in a poorly performing project as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and develop into a profitable multifamily community also real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate as a result of changing market conditions under current market conditions we have recorded impairment charges on certain of our land held for development and may have future impairments of our land these impairment charges are based on estimates of fair value given the current environment the amount of market information available to estimate fair value is less than usual if additional market information becomes available in future periods we may take additional impairment charges in the future 

difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility 

we intend to evaluate the potential disposition of assets that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell an asset we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers in a timely manner as real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly especially when market conditions are poor these difficulties have been exacerbated in the current credit environment because buyers have experienced difficulty in obtaining the necessary financing these factors may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and may also limit our ability to utilize sales proceeds as a source of liquidity which would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt in addition in order to maintain our status as a reit the code imposes restrictions on our ability to sell properties held fewer than two years which may cause us to incur losses thereby reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt 

  4 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act “ada” the fair housing amendments act of 1988 “fhaa” and other federal state and local laws generally require public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features which increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we may incur unanticipated expenses which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations to comply with ada fhaa and other federal state and local laws or in connection with lawsuits brought by private litigants 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents charged 

risks associated with our operations 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

although we expect decreasing levels of development activity in 2009 as compared to prior years in the long term we intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our property portfolio our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs including the following 

 

we also serve as the general contractor on a limited number of development and construction projects related to properties owned by unrelated third parties pursuant to guaranteed maximum price contracts the terms of these contracts require us to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and we assume the risk the time and costs associated with our performance may be greater than was anticipated as a result our profitability on guaranteed maximum price contracts is dependent on our ability to accurately predict these factors the time and costs may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond our control in addition the terms of these contracts generally require a warranty period which may have a duration of up to ten years during which we may be required to repair replace or rebuild a project in the event of a material defect 

  5 

our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

subject to the requirements of the funds we may acquire additional operating properties on a select basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

with respect to acquisitions of operating companies we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us or may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges such as personnel and technology 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties 

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other apartment reits will compete with us to acquire new properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductible provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

investments through joint ventures and partnerships involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

we have invested and may continue to invest as a partner in joint ventures or partnerships these investments involve risks including the possibility our partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture’s or partnership’s financial obligations we and our partner may each have the right to initiate a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 

we face risks associated with investments in and management of discretionary funds 

we have formed the funds which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and advisor and to which we have committed 20 of the total equity interest up to 75 million in the aggregate as of december 31 2008 the funds had total capital commitments of 375 million there are risks associated with the investment in and management of the funds including the following 

 

  6 

 

we depend on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business 

as a large publiclytraded owner of multifamily properties we may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify in the future as a reit the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions 

 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

  7 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including the following 

 

cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regards to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains this requirement limits the cash flow available to meet required principal payments on our debt 

we have significant debt which could have important adverse consequences 

as of december 31 2008 we had outstanding debt of approximately 28 billion this indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indentures under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility a default in these provisions if uncured could require us to repay the indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

we may be unable to renew repay or refinance our outstanding debt 

we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or unsecured indebtedness will not be able to be renewed repaid or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to us such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the internal revenue code 

  8 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes in addition we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

we may incur losses on interest rate hedging arrangements 

periodically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with changes in interest rates and we may continue to do so in the future although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they may also reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness which is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent which the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other additionally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  

moody’s and standard  poor’s the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of baa1 and bbb respectively on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings in light of the difficulties in the real estate industry and the volatile financial markets we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction

our share price will fluctuate 

stock markets in general and our common shares have experienced significant price volatility over the past year the market price and volume of our common shares may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to the risk factors discussed in this report and the following 

 

we may reduce dividends on our equity securities or elect to pay a portion of the dividend in common shares 

on november 24 2008 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a fourth quarter dividend of 070 per common share totaling 280 per share for the year ended december 31 2008 in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regards to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains however in the event of among other factors continued material future deterioration in business conditions or continuing tightening in the credit markets our board of trust managers may decide to reduce our dividend while ensuring compliance with the requirements of the code related to reit qualification in december 2008 the internal revenue service announced it would treat a cash option share dividend as satisfying a public reit’s distribution requirements for 2008 and 2009 so long as certain requirements are met we may elect to pay dividends during this period in part in our common shares which would cause dilution to our earnings per share given the additional shares outstanding

executive summary 

our fiscal year 2008 results reflect the challenges the multifamily industry faced during the year during fiscal year 2008 the factors adversely affecting demand for and rents received in our multifamily communities became more intense and pervasive across the united states as a result the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging high inventory levels of singlefamily homes and condominiums in the markets in which we operate overall weak consumer confidence and fears of a prolonged recession among other factors have persisted throughout fiscal year 2008 the effects of these factors have been further magnified by credit tightening in the financial markets increasing home foreclosures and severe shortages of liquidity in the financial markets 

based on our results for fiscal year 2008 the deteriorating market conditions discussed above and our belief these conditions may not improve quickly we expect negative growth in property revenues during fiscal year 2009 current factors which may negatively affect our future performance include recent and expected future job losses liquidity disruptions in the capital markets recessionary concerns uncertainty in the financial markets and a continued oversupply of singlefamily homes and condominiums in many of the markets in which we operate however positive impacts on our performance may result from reductions in the us home ownership rate more stringent lending criteria for prospective homebuyers and longterm growth prospects for population employment and household formations in our markets although there can be no assurance any of these factors will continue or will positively impact our operating results 

due to the instability experienced during the current economic downturn we believe the timing of an economic recovery is unclear and these conditions may not improve quickly our near term primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by selectively disposing of properties controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs generating positive cash flows from operations and reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios 

we intend to continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of discretionary investment funds until the earlier of i december 31 2011 or ii such time as 90 of its committed capital is invested subject to two oneyear extensions the fund and the coinvestment vehicle will be our exclusive investment vehicles for acquiring fully developed multifamily properties subject to certain exceptions our portfolio of apartment communities is geographically diverse which we believe mitigates risks such as changes in demographics or job growth which may occur within individual markets although may not mitigate such risks with respect to more wide spread economic declines in the long term we also intend to continue focusing on our development pipeline which currently contains twelve properties in various stages of construction leaseup and predevelopment the commencement of future developments has and may continue to be impacted by macroeconomic issues increasing construction costs and other factors we expect decreasing levels of development activity in 2009 as compared to prior years 

we review our assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable our impairment evaluations reflected our expectation of continued and increased challenges in the development of future multifamily communities our belief these challenges will persist for some time and our decision to not continue with five future development projects based on our evaluations we recorded significant impairment charges in the fourth quarter to our land valuations which materially affected our operating results during fiscal year 2008 land valuations may continue to have significant fluctuations due to among other things the current economic environment and as a result there can be no assurance we will not have further impairments in the future 

the continuation of the current economic environment and capital market disruptions have and could continue to have a negative impact on us and adversely affect our future results of operations

discontinued operations and assets held for sale 

we intend to maintain a longterm strategy of managing our invested capital through the selective sale of properties and to utilize the proceeds to reduce our outstanding debt and leverage ratios and fund investments with higher anticipated growth prospects in our markets income from discontinued operations includes the operations of properties including land sold during the period or classified as held for sale as of december 31 2008 the components of earnings classified as discontinued operations include separately identifiable propertyspecific revenues expenses depreciation and interest expense if any the gain on the disposal of the held for sale properties is also classified as discontinued operations

results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio the leaseup of newly constructed properties acquisitions and dispositions where appropriate comparisons of income and expense on communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollarsperweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows

  27 

same store analysis 

our same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 increased approximately 71 million or 15 from 2007 resulting primarily from increases in other property income partially offset by a decline in rental revenues due to slight declines in average occupancy and average rental rates for our same store portfolio same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 increased approximately 183 million or 40 from 2006 primarily from increases in other property income and higher average rental income per apartment home partially offset by declines in occupancy 

same store property revenues for 2008 as compared to 2007 were positively impacted by increases in other property income due to the continued implementation of the perfect connection also known as camdentv in 2008 which provides cable services to our residents and other utility rebilling programs the increase in other property income was partially offset by a decrease in average rental rates as we experienced rental rate decreases primarily as a result of the challenges we and the multifamily industry faced throughout the year which are discussed in detail in the “executive summary” average total occupancy at our same store properties declined in 2008 as we experienced decreases in occupancy in a majority of our markets we believe our operating performance during the current market environment benefited from the continued operational and technological enhancements we are making at many of our communities which have created opportunities to take advantage of additional revenue sources 

same store property revenues for 2007 as compared to 2006 were positively impacted by increases in revenues in substantially all markets these revenue increases were driven by other property income which increased due to the implementation of perfect connection and other utility rebilling programs our same store communities recognized an overall increase in average rental rates and we experienced rental rate increases in all markets the increase in average rental rates in 2007 was a result of moderate improvements in fundamentals such as job growth population growth and household formations average occupancy at our same store properties declined less than 1 in 2007 as we had slight decreases in occupancy in a majority of our markets 

total property expenses from our same store communities increased approximately 84 million or 46 and approximately 39 million or 23 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 respectively the increases in same store property expenses per apartment home of 207 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 were primarily due to increases in utility expenses in connection with our utility rebilling programs and real estate taxes real estate taxes increased primarily due to increases in appraisals and taxation rates the increase for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to increases in repair and maintenance costs as well as utility expenses in connection with our utility rebilling programs 

nonsame store analysis and other analysis 

property revenues from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 286 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and increased approximately 289 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 the increases in both periods were primarily due to the completion and leaseup of certain properties in our development pipeline as well as property acquisitions in 2007 and 2006 see “development and leaseup properties” for additional detail of occupancy at properties in our development pipeline 

property expenses from nonsame store and development and leaseup communities increased approximately 125 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and approximately 123 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 the increases in both periods were due to the completion and leaseup of properties in our development pipeline as well as acquisitions completed in 2007 and 2006 

property revenues from dispositionsother decreased approximately 01 million and approximately 199 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 respectively the decrease for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily related to properties partially sold to joint ventures 

property expenses from dispositionsother increased approximately 07 million and decreased approximately 94 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 respectively the increase for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to december 31 2007 primarily related to insurance costs related to hurricane ike refer to note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion the decrease for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to december 31 2006 primarily related to properties partially sold to joint ventures

nonproperty income 

 

 fee and asset management income which represents income related to thirdparty construction and development projects and property management for the year ended december 31 2008 increased approximately 09 million as compared to 2007 and decreased approximately 57 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 growth was relatively flat for 2008 as compared to 2007 due to decreased thirdparty construction activities in 2008 partially offset by increases in management fees earned from the fund the decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to increased fees earned from joint ventures and thirdparty construction and development projects in 2006 as compared to 2007 as these 2006 projects were winding down in 2007 and were not replaced with additional projects 

interest and other income decreased approximately 41 million for 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased approximately 10 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 interest income which primarily relates to interest earned on notes receivable outstanding under our mezzanine financing program decreased approximately 08 million for 2008 as compared to 2007 and increased approximately 06 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 the decrease for 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to contractual reductions in interest rates related to mezzanine loans for development communities which have reached stabilization reductions in interest earned on variable rate notes due to reductions in the london interbank offered rate “libor” and principal payments received in 2008 the increase for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to new notes issued during the latter part of 2006 of approximately 91 million other income decreased approximately 33 million for 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased approximately 16 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 other income primarily represents income recognized upon the settlement of legal insurance and warranty claims and contract disputes in 2007 other income included approximately 33 million related to settlement of a contract dispute 

income on deferred compensation plans decreased approximately 407 million during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased approximately 28 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 the changes in income primarily related to the performance of the assets held in the deferred compensation plans for plan participants which is subject to fluctuations in the financial markets

fee and asset management expense which represents expenses related to thirdparty construction and development projects and property management increased approximately 15 million for 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased approximately 48 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 the increase for 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with the fund partially offset by decreases in our thirdparty construction activities the decrease for 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to decreased thirdparty activities offset by costs associated with the fund which was formed in the latter part of 2007 

general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 10 million during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased approximately 50 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 and were 50 54 and 64 of total revenues excluding income or loss on deferred compensation plans for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the decreases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and for december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 were primarily due to decreases in salaries incentive compensation and legal expenses additionally during 2006 an aggregate of 76542 share awards that otherwise would have vested from time to time over the next five years became immediately exercisable by accelerating the vesting of these share awards we recognized a onetime expense of approximately 42 million for the year ended december 31 2006 

interest expense for the year ended 2008 increased approximately 166 million as compared to 2007 primarily due to the repurchase of common shares using debt proceeds the timing of refinancing portions of our longterm indebtedness at higher rates and decreased capitalized interest partially offset by decreased amounts outstanding on our line of credit our repurchases and early retirement of outstanding debt and a decline in interest rates on our floating rate debt refer to note 9 “notes payable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt repurchases and retirements interest expense for the year ended 2007 decreased approximately 16 million as compared to 2006 factors contributing to the decrease in interest expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 include repayment of debt from proceeds received from our july 2006 equity offering property dispositions during both periods and interest adjustments related to tax liabilities partially offsetting this decrease was interest incurred on debt used to repurchase our common shares during 2007 while our average debt level outstanding during 2007 increased slightly as compared to 2006 we continued to fund construction costs associated with our development pipeline increasing interest capitalized by approximately 20 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 

depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 145 million during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and increased approximately 81 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 the increases were primarily due to an increased level of new development and capital improvements placed in service each year as compared to the previous year partially offset by dispositions 

amortization of deferred financing costs decreased 07 million and 01 million during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease for fiscal year 2008 was due to certain deferred financing costs becoming fully amortized 

expense on deferred compensation plans decreased approximately 407 million during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased approximately 28 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 the changes in expense primarily related to the performance of the assets held in the deferred compensation plans for plan participants which is subject to fluctuations in the financial markets

gain on sale of properties including land totaled approximately 29 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due to gains on the partial sale of properties to the fund and a gain on the sale of a land parcel in las vegas nevada to an unaffiliated thirdparty there was no gain on sale of properties including land for the year ended december 31 2007 gain on sale of properties including land for the year ended december 31 2006 included gains of approximately 915 million from the partial sale of nine operating properties to an affiliated joint venture and approximately 52 million from the partial sales of land to affiliated joint ventures also included in gain on sale of properties for the year ended december 31 2006 was approximately 08 million from the sale of undeveloped land to an unaffiliated third party see further discussion of gains associated with property dispositions in “property portfolio” 

gain on early retirement of debt was approximately 136 million for the year ended december 31 2008 these gains were the result of various repurchases and retirements of debt and included a tender offer for certain series of outstanding debt which resulted in the repurchase and retirement of approximately 1083 million of debt from unrelated third parties for approximately 1006 million in addition to the tender offer we repurchased and retired approximately 827 million of various series of other outstanding debt from unrelated third parties for approximately 757 million during the year ended december 31 2008 these gains were partially offset by the proportionate share of unamortized loan costs and other costs associated with the retirement of the debt 

the impairment loss on land for the year ended december 31 2008 of approximately 513 million reflects impairments in the value of land holdings for several potential development projects we no longer plan to pursue including approximately 486 million related to land holdings for five projects we no longer plan to develop approximately 16 million in the value of a land parcel held for future development and approximately 11 million for costs capitalized for a potential joint venture development we no longer plan to pursue the impairment loss on land for the year ended december 31 2007 of approximately 14 million reflects impairment in the value of one potential development project we no longer plan to pursue these impairment charges are the difference between each parcel’s estimated fair value and the carrying value which includes pursuit and other costs 

equity in income loss of joint ventures decreased approximately 28 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased approximately 36 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 changes from period to period were due to changes in the number of properties held through joint ventures and the development dilution we are experiencing on the completion of units in our joint venture development pipeline which resulted in depreciation and interest expense recorded exceeding income recognized as these properties have not reached stabilization we recognized approximately 28 million of gains for our proportionate share of the sale of three properties held through a joint venture during the year ended december 31 2006 

income allocated to common units and other minority interests decreased approximately 07 million during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased approximately 110 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 income allocated to common units in 2006 included the impact of gains recognized on the partial sale of eight properties to an affiliated joint venture during the year ended december 31 2006 a portion of the gains recognized were allocated to minority interest holders in camden operating lp 

for the tax year ended december 31 2008 we had current income tax expense of approximately 08 million income tax expense decreased 22 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 primarily attributable to less gains on property dispositions in states with high income tax rates and changes in state tax laws affecting one of our operating partnerships 

funds from operations “ffo” 

management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including minority interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 

  31 

we believe in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income to diluted ffo for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 are as follows 

 

 liquidity and capital resources 

financial condition and sources of liquidity 

we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

 

 

 

 

our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was 26 30 and 29 times for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our interest expense coverage ratio is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses nonproperty income other expenses income from discontinued operations depreciation amortization and interest expense at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 783 816 and 805 respectively of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered our weighted average maturity of debt excluding our line of credit was 50 years at december 31 2008 

due to the instability experienced during the current economic downturn we believe the timing of an economic recovery is unclear and these conditions may not improve quickly our near term primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by selectively disposing of properties controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs generating positive cash flows from operations and reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios 

  32 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations other sources include the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments and access to the capital markets we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs during 2009 including 

 

 

 

 

 

factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to current volatility in capital and credit markets sources of financing completion of planned asset sales the effect our debt level and decreases in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets and changes in operating costs resulting from a weakened economy which could also impact occupancy and rental rates and ultimately impact our planned growth of capital 

cash flows 

certain sources and uses of cash such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures repurchases of debt and common shares and distributions paid on our equity securities are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon market conditions the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 2170 million during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to approximately 2231 million for the same period in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to increased interest payments on our levels of outstanding debt timing of payments of trade payables and receivables offset by growth in revenues from our same store nonsame store and development communities 

cash flows used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2008 totaled approximately 374 million as compared to approximately 3468 million during the year ended december 31 2007 cash outflows for property development acquisition and capital improvements were approximately 1993 million during 2008 as compared to approximately 5008 million during 2007 proceeds received from sales of properties sales of assets to joint ventures joint venture distributions representing returns of investments and sale of technology investments totaled approximately 1771 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to approximately 1789 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately 1731 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of approximately 3792 million in repayment of outstanding notes payable the repayment consisted of approximately 1006 million of outstanding notes payable related to our december 2008 tender offer repurchase and retirement of approximately 757 million of various series of other outstanding debt and repayment of approximately 2019 million of maturing secured notes payable see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements “notes payable” for further discussion net cash used in financing activities was also attributable to distributions paid to shareholders and minority interest holders of approximately 1723 million and approximately 331 million of common share repurchases offset by proceeds from notes payable and increases in our unsecured line of credit of approximately 3859 million and 300 million respectively net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately 1236 million for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily as a result of approximately 8080 million in proceeds from notes payable offset by repayment of balances outstanding on our line of credit of approximately 910 million payments of approximately 2134 million related to the payoff of two senior unsecured notes and one mortgage note approximately 2005 million of common share repurchases and distributions paid to shareholders and minority interest holders of approximately 1781 million

financial flexibility 

we have a 600 million unsecured credit facility which matures in january 2010 and can be extended at our option through january 2011 the scheduled interest rate is based on spreads over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the prime rate the scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of 300 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations all of which we believe we are in compliance 

our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2008 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 105 million and had approximately 4445 million available under our unsecured line of credit 

as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit from time to time we borrow using competitively bid unsecured shortterm notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group such borrowings vary in term and pricing and are typically priced at interest rates below those available under the unsecured line of credit 

we have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission which allows us to offer from time to time common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 110000000 shares of beneficial interest consisting of 100000000 common shares and 10000000 preferred shares as of december 31 2008 we had 66027911 common shares and no preferred shares outstanding 

we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody’s and standard and poor’s which are currently baa1 and bbb respectively as well as the ability to borrow on a secured basis from fannie mae or freddie mac however we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption which has caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably and have made it more difficult to borrow money if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all 

future cash requirements and contractual obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit used to fund development and acquisition activities during 2009 approximately 39 million of secured mortgage notes and approximately 1305 million of unsecured debt including scheduled principal amortizations are scheduled to mature see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements “notes payable” for further discussion of scheduled maturities additionally as of december 31 2008 we had several current development projects in various stages of construction for which a total estimated cost of approximately 634 million remained to be funded we anticipate funding approximately 6 million of these costs through our unsecured line of credit and the remaining approximate 57 million from existing joint venture construction loans we intend to meet our longterm liquidity requirements through the use of cash flows from operations draws on our unsecured credit facility property dispositions secured mortgage notes and debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 

in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regards to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains in november 2008 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of 070 per share to our common shareholders of record as of december 4 2008 the dividend was subsequently paid on january 2 2009 we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annualized dividend rate of 280 per share or unit

the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt we are committed to additional funding under mezzanine loans provided to joint ventures see further discussion of our investments in various joint ventures in note 7 “investments in joint ventures” and a discussion of our mezzanine construction financing in note 8 “notes receivable” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those most important to the presentation of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we follow financial accounting and reporting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

general a comprehensive enumeration of our significant accounting policies is presented in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2008 and 2007 and for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 each of our policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

principles of consolidation  our consolidated financial statements include our accounts the accounts of variable interest entities “vies” in which we are the primary beneficiary and the accounts of other subsidiaries and joint ventures over which we have control all intercompany transactions balances and profits have been eliminated in consolidation investments acquired or created are evaluated based on financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation “fin” 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” as revised which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if the investment is determined not to be within the scope of fin 46r then the investments are evaluated for consolidation using american institute of certified public accountants’ statement of position 789 “accounting for investments in real estate ventures” and accounting research bulletin 51 “consolidated financial statements” if we are the general partner in a limited partnership we also consider the guidance of emerging issues task force issue 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us 

  35 

use of estimates in the application of gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures our more significant estimates relate to estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets estimates of the useful lives of our assets reserves related to our general liability and employee benefit programs estimates related to our investments in joint ventures and mezzanine construction financing and estimates of expected losses of variable interest entities these estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 

income recognition our rental and other property revenue is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned other property revenue consists primarily of utility rebillings and administrative application and other transactional fees charged to our residents our apartment homes are rented to residents on lease terms generally ranging from six to fifteen months with monthly payments due in advance interest fee and asset management and all other sources of income are recognized as earned two of our properties are subject to rent control or rent stabilization operations of apartment properties acquired are recorded from the date of acquisition in accordance with the purchase method of accounting in management’s opinion due to the number of residents the types and diversity of submarkets in which the properties operate and the collection terms there is no significant concentration of credit risk 

cost capitalization real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development expenditures directly related to the development acquisition and improvement of real estate assets excluding internal costs relating to acquisitions of operating properties are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively 

where possible we stage our construction to allow leasing and occupancy during the construction period which we believe minimizes the duration of the leaseup period following completion of construction our accounting policy related to properties in the development and leasing phase is all operating expenses associated with completed apartment homes are expensed we capitalize renovation and improvement costs we believe extend the economic lives of depreciable property capital expenditures subsequent to initial construction are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives which range from three to twenty years 

depreciation and amortization is computed over the expected useful lives of depreciable property on a straightline basis with lives generally as follows 

 

derivative instruments we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and we designate the derivative instruments as cash flow hedges derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value for cash flow hedge relationships changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument deemed effective at offsetting the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive income or loss and are reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings the ineffective portion is recognized in current period earnings derivatives not designated or not qualifying for hedge treatment must be recorded at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings in the period of change we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we use derivative instruments to reduce the potential impact of changes in interest rates on variablerate debt 

we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in hedging the exposure to the hedged transaction’s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed and measured both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis we assess whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items we discontinue hedge accounting if a derivative is not determined to be highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge 

  36 

accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets reflects the effective portions of cumulative changes in the fair value of derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships 

asset impairment longlived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its respective fair value we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows trends strategic decisions regarding future development plans and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding such factors as market rents economies and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in estimating fair value management uses appraisals management estimates or discounted cash flow calculations in addition we continually evaluate our investments in joint ventures and mezzanine construction financing and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value or if it is probable we will not collect all interest and principal in accordance with the terms of the mezzanine loan we will record an impairment charge based on these evaluations in general we provide mezzanine loans to affiliated joint ventures constructing or operating multifamily assets while we believe it is currently probable we will collect all scheduled principal and interest with respect to these development loans current market conditions with respect to credit availability and with respect to real estate market fundamentals inject a significant amount of uncertainty into the environment given this any future adverse development in market conditions would cause us to reevaluate our conclusions and could result in material impairment charges with respect to our mezzanine loans 

the value of our properties held for development depends on market conditions including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of future demand of multifamily communities we have analyzed trends and other information related to each potential development and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process with respect to impairments including the fact that limited market information regarding the value of comparable land exists at this time it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 

we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets properties under development and land is currently recoverable however if market conditions worsen beyond our current expectations or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations we may need to take additional charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets any such noncash charges would have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we do not purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities which no longer fit into our plans and we determine the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset the asset is accounted for as properties held for sale including land assuming the held for sale criteria defined in statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas 157 “ fair value measurements ” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the statement does not require new fair value measurements but is applied to the extent other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements the statement emphasizes fair value as a marketbased measurement which should be determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp 1572 “ effective date of fasb statement 157 ” which deferred the effective date of sfas 157 for us to january 1 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for those which are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis we have adopted fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective january 1 2009 and this adoption has not and is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value 

  37 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas 141r “business combinations” which replaced sfas 141 “business combinations” sfas 141r applies to all transactions or events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses sfas 141r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial impact of the business combination sfas 141r is effective for us for business combinations made on or after january 1 2009 we expect the adoption of sfas 141r to have a material effect on our accounting for future acquisitions of properties which may fall under the definition of a business as most transaction costs associated with such acquisitions will be expensed as opposed to the prior treatment of such charges as capitalized costs 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas 160 “ noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb 51” sfas 160 clarifies a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in a consolidated entity which should be reported as equity in the parent’s consolidated financial statements sfas 160 requires a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of equity attributable to noncontrolling interests and disclosure on the face of the consolidated income statements of those amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests eliminating the past practice of reporting these amounts as an adjustment in arriving at consolidated net income sfas 160 also requires a parent to recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated and requires the parent to attribute to a noncontrolling interest its share of losses even if such treatment results in a deficit noncontrolling interests balance within the parent’s equity accounts sfas 160 is effective for us on january 1 2009 and most provisions will be applied retrospectively we are currently evaluating the effects if any the adoption of sfas 160 may have on our financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” 0361 “ determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities ” fsp 0361 affects entities which accrue nonreturnable cash dividends on sharebased payment awards during the awards’ service period the fasb concluded unvested sharebased payment awards which are entitled to nonforfeitable cash dividends whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and are participants of undistributed earnings because the awards are considered participating securities the issuer is required to apply the twoclass method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share which involves separate computations for common shares and participating securities as we do accrue and pay nonforfeitable cash dividends on unvested sharebased payment awards these types of awards are considered participating securities and will be included in our earnings per share calculation in future periods fsp 0361 is effective for us on january 1 2009 and will require retrospective application the retrospective application on our adoption of this fsp would not have had any impact on basic or diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2008 the impact of our adoption of this fsp on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2007 would result in a decrease of approximately 001 and 002 respectively 

in october 2008 the fasb issued fsp 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active” fsp 1573 clarifies the application of sfas 157 “fair value measurements” in a nonactive market fsp 1573 became effective upon issuance including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued we adopted fsp 1573 upon issuance and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the table below provides information about our assets and our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

 

we use variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we incur additional variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates would increase 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant 

holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 760 million the net income available to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt excluding debt effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements described below would be approximately 37 million holding all other variables constant 

we currently use interest rate caps and swaps to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable indebtedness not for trading or speculative purposes under the cap and swap agreements 

 

 

as of december 31 2008 the effect of our swap agreements was to fix the interest rate on approximately 5034 million of our variable rate debt had the swap agreements not been in place during 2008 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 93 million lower based on balances and reported interest rates through the year as the variable interest rates were less than the effective interest rates on the associated swap agreements additionally if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher through 2008 and the swap agreements not been in place our annual interest cost would have been approximately 42 million lower 

derivative financial investments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements we believe we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major creditworthy financial institutions as part of our ongoing control procedures we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity thus minimizing credit risk concentration we believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty nonperformance is remote 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to securities exchange act “exchange act” rules 13a15e and 15d15e based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our exchange act filings is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms 

changes in internal controls   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d in rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

financial information about segments 

we are engaged in the ownership development construction and management of multifamily apartment communities as each of our apartment communities has similar economic characteristics residents and products and services our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment see our consolidated financial statements and notes included thereto in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for certain information required by item 1 

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2007 we owned interests in operated or were developing 193 multifamily properties comprising 66468 apartment homes located in 13 states we had 3383 apartment homes under development at 11 of our multifamily properties including 1257 apartment homes at four multifamily properties owned through joint ventures and several sites we intend to develop into multifamily apartment communities additionally two properties comprised of 391 apartment homes were designated as held for sale 

operating strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to produce consistent earnings growth 

real estate investments and market balance we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of opportunities in new markets which have healthy longterm fundamentals and strong growth projections these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure allow us to concentrate our growth efforts toward selective opportunities to achieve our strategy of having a geographically and physically diverse portfolio of assets which meet the requirements of our residents 

    

we continue to operate in our core markets in which we believe we have an advantage due to economies of scale we feel where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing several properties in the same market however consistent with our goal of generating consistent earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations 

we believe we have a strong development pipeline and we expect selective development of new apartment properties will continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio for the next several years we use experienced onsite construction superintendents operating under the supervision of project managers and senior management to control the construction process risks inherent to developing real estate include zoning changes environmental matters and changes in economic conditions during the development process see further discussion of risks associated with development and construction in our “risk factors” section 

we typically make physical improvements at our acquired properties such as new or enhanced landscaping design new or upgraded amenities and redesigned building structures which coupled with a strong focus on property management branding and marketing have resulted in attractive yields on acquired properties 

our expertise in development and redevelopment allow us to selectively acquire apartment communities in the fourth quarter of 2007 we had the first closing of our discretionary investment vehicle which during its investment period ending no later than december 2011 will be our exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities subject to certain exceptions over the next several years we expect to increase our acquisition activity through the discretionary investment vehicle focusing on communities in our markets that can benefit from redevelopment repositioning or market cycle opportunities please review the “risk factors” section for a discussion of risks associated with acquisitions and our discretionary investment vehicle 

sophisticated property management we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and improve resident retention thereby reducing operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to their residents we strive to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon operational results produced at their property rental rate increases and level of lease renewals achieved 

operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property net operating income we believe our webbased property management and revenue management systems strengthen onsite operations and allow us to quickly adjust rental rates as local market conditions change lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each property’s seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to fifteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to ensure timely response to residents’ changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

investments in joint ventures we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by the joint venture or partnership our decision whether to hold the entire interest in an apartment community ourselves or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture or partnership is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i our projection in some circumstances we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture or partnership vehicle is used ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community who may prefer or who may require less payment if the land or community is contributed to a joint venture or partnership investments in joint ventures or partnerships are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 

  2 

we have formed the camden multifamily value add fund lp the “fund” a discretionary investment vehicle to make direct and indirect investments in multifamily real estate throughout the united states primarily through acquisitions of operating properties and certain land parcels which we will contribute to the fund for development the fund will serve until the earlier of i four years from the date of the final closing of the fund or ii such time as 90 of the fund’s committed capital is invested as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire fullydeveloped multifamily properties subject to certain exceptions these exceptions include properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions followon investments made with respect to prior investments significant transactions which include the issuance of our securities significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions significant merger and acquisition activities acquisitions which are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund transactions with our existing ventures contributions or sales of properties to or entities in which we remain an investor and transactions approved by the fund’s advisory board the fund will not restrict our development activities and will terminate after a term of eight years from the final closing subject to two oneyear extensions as of december 31 2007 we have acquired two communities with the intent of being owned by the fund but which are currently consolidated and included in our operating results we are currently targeting acquisitions for the fund where value creation opportunities are present through one or more of the following redevelopment activities market cycle opportunities or improved property operations we expect the fund to have equity commitments of up to 300 million and the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 70 on a stabilized portfolio basis which would enable the fund to invest up to approximately 1 billion one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of the fund and we have committed 20 of the total equity of the fund up to 60 million we have received commitments from an unaffiliated investor of 150 million as of december 31 2007 we expect the final closing of the fund to occur during 2008 there can be no assurance as to the timing of such closing the size or investment performance of the fund 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2007 we had approximately 1900 employees including executive administrative and community personnel 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2007 we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we meet certain requirements of the code

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks please note additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

risks associated with real estate 

unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact occupancy or rental rates 

economic conditions may significantly affect apartment home occupancy or rental rates occupancy and rental rates in the markets in which we operate in turn may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results the risks which may affect conditions in these markets include the following 

 

national regional and local economic climates may be adversely affected should population or job growth continue to slow certain of the markets in which we operate have recently experienced a decrease in job growth to the extent this worsens market rental rates will likely be adversely affected we could also face challenges of adequately managing and maintaining our properties due to increasing operating costs associated with resident turnover and other factors as a result we may experience a decrease in rental revenues which may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to pay distributions to shareholders 

difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility 

real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly especially when market conditions are poor this may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions in addition in order to maintain our status as a reit the code imposes restrictions on our ability to sell properties held fewer than four years which may cause us to incur losses thereby reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting distributions to shareholders 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act “ada” the fair housing amendments act of 1988 “fhaa” and other federal state and local laws generally require public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features which increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons we may incur unanticipated expenses that may be material to our financial condition or results of operations to comply with ada fhaa and other federal state and local laws or in connection with lawsuits brought by private litigants 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents charged 

  4 

risks associated with our operations 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our property portfolio our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs including the following 

 

we also develop and construct properties for unrelated third parties pursuant to guaranteed maximum price contracts the terms of these contracts require us to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and we assume the risk the time and costs associated with our performance may be greater than was anticipated as a result our profitability on guaranteed maximum price contracts is dependent on our ability to accurately predict these factors the time and costs may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond our control in addition the terms of these contracts generally require a warranty period which may have a duration of up to ten years during which we may be required to repair replace or rebuild a project in the event of a material defect 

our property acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

subject to the requirements of the fund we may acquire additional operating properties on a select basis our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties 

we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other apartment reits will compete with us to acquire new properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

  5 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we are liable for costs to investigate and remove or remediate hazardous or toxic substances on or in our properties in some cases regardless of whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of these substances these costs and other costs of investigation remediation or removal of hazardous substances may be substantial also the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on a property or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent the property or use the property as collateral 

additionally we occasionally develop manage lease andor operate various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been or to be an operator of these properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances 

over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have subsequently excluded mold related claims from standard policies and increased the pricing of mold endorsements therefore should we be named in a lawsuit regarding mold infiltration the amount of damages may not be fully covered under insurance 

investments through joint ventures and partnerships involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly we have invested and may continue to invest in a joint venture or partnership as a partner these investments involve risks including the possibility our partner may become insolvent our partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours or our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 

we face risks associated with an investment in and management of a discretionary fund 

we have formed the fund which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and advisor and to which we have committed 20 of the total equity interest up to 60 million as of december 31 2007 the fund had total capital commitments of 1875 million there are risks associated with the investment in and management of the fund including the following 

 

  6 

 

we depend on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business 

as a large publiclytraded owner of multifamily properties we may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations 

risks associated with our indebtedness and financing 

volatility in debt markets could adversely impact future acquisitions and values of real estate assets 

the commercial real estate debt markets are currently experiencing volatility as a result of certain factors including the tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies and the significant inventory of unsold collateralized mortgage backed securities in the market the volatility has resulted in lenders decreasing the availability of debt financing as well as increasing the cost of debt financing as a result we may not be able to obtain debt financing in the future on favorable terms or at all this may result in future acquisitions generating lower overall economic returns which may adversely affect our results of operations and distributions to shareholders in addition the volatility in debt markets could adversely impact the overall amount of capital investing in real estate which may result in price or value decreases of real estate assets and in turn negatively impact the current value of our existing assets 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders and create refinancing risk 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including the following 

 

  7 

 

cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regards to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit this requirement limits the cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments on our debt we may need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or a refinancing may not occur on favorable terms either of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant debt which could have important adverse consequences 

as of december 31 2007 we had outstanding debt of approximately 28 billion this indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon the market index in addition we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense unless we make arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

we may incur losses on interest rate hedging arrangements 

periodically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness which is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent which the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

  8 

risks associated with our shares 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility we will fail to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares that might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

various changes could adversely impact the market price of our common shares 

the market price of our publicly traded common shares depends on various conditions the risks which may affect this market price include the following 

 

risks associated with income tax laws 

tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify in the future as a reit the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit 

 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for distribution to our shareholders

operating properties 

the 182 operating properties including properties held through joint ventures which we owned interests in and operated at december 31 2007 averaged 914 square feet of living area per apartment home for the year ended december 31 2007 no single operating property accounted for greater than 21 of our total revenues our operating properties including properties held through joint ventures had a weighted average occupancy rate of 937 and 952 for 2007 and 2006 respectively resident lease terms generally range from six to fifteen months one hundred and fiftyfour of our operating properties have over 200 apartment homes with the largest having 904 apartment homes our operating properties have an average age of 94 years calculated on the basis of investment dollars our operating properties were constructed and placed in service as follows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report historical results and trends which might appear in the consolidated financial statements should not be interpreted as being indicative of future operations 

we consider portions of this report to be “forwardlooking” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 both as amended with respect to our expectations for future periods forwardlooking statements do not discuss historical fact but instead include statements related to expectations projections intentions or other items relating to the future although we believe the expectations reflected in our forwardlooking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance our expectations will be achieved any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact should be deemed forwardlooking statements reliance should not be placed on these forwardlooking statements as they are subject to known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors beyond our control and could differ materially from our actual results and performance 

factors that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those contemplated by forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 

these forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report 

executive summary 

based on our results for the year ended december 31 2007 and the projected economic conditions we expect moderating growth during 2008 economic factors affecting our revenue include declining job growth and continued population growth and household formations in the markets in which we operate as well as declining fundamentals in the forsale singlefamily housing market negative sentiment currently surrounding singlefamily housing could have a positive impact on multifamily demand as more potential home buyers choose to rent and existing renters extend their stays in apartment homes however high inventories of unsold singlefamily homes in select markets could cause further declines in home prices making home buying a more attractive option for some renters or resulting in additional singlefamily homes becoming rental units 

  18 

we intend to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund during its term which will end eight years from the final closing subject to two oneyear extensions the fund will be our exclusive investment vehicle for acquiring fully developed multifamily properties subject to certain exceptions we expect market concentration risk to be mitigated as our property operations are not centralized in any one market and our portfolio of apartment communities are geographically diverse we also intend to continue focusing on our development pipeline with approximately 20 billion to 25 billion in our current and future development pipelines total projected capital costs and the commencement of future developments may be impacted by increasing construction costs and other factors 

property portfolio 

our multifamily property portfolio excluding land held for future development and joint venture properties which we do not manage is summarized as follows 

 

 

  19 

stabilized communities 

we consider a property stabilized once it reaches 90 occupancy during the year ended december 31 2007 stabilization was achieved at four completed properties as follows 

 

acquisition communities 

during april 2007 we acquired camden south congress a 253apartment home community located in austin texas for 428 million and during june 2007 we acquired camden royal palms a 352apartment home community located in tampa florida for 411 million both properties were purchased with proceeds using our unsecured line of credit the purchase prices of these properties were allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition

results of operations 

changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to acquisitions sales of assets to joint ventures the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio and the leaseup of newly constructed properties where appropriate comparisons of income and expense on communities included in continuing operations are made on a perweighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows

same store analysis 

our same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 increased 195 million or 41 from 2006 resulting primarily from higher average rental income per apartment home and increases in other property income partially offset by declines in occupancy same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 209 million or 71 from 2005 primarily from higher average rental income per apartment home 

same store property revenues for 2007 as compared to 2006 were positively impacted by increases in revenues in substantially all markets these revenue increases were driven by other property income which increased due to the implementation of perfect connection also known as camdentv which provides cable services to our residents and other utility rebilling programs our same store communities recognized an overall increase in average rental rates as we experienced rental rate increases in all markets the increase in average rental rates was a result of moderate improvements in fundamentals resulting from continued job growth population growth and household formations average occupancy at our same store properties declined less than 1 in 2007 as we saw decreases in occupancy in a majority of our markets we believe our operating performance was also a result of the continued operational and technological enhancements we are making at many of our communities which have created opportunities to take advantage of additional revenue sources 

same store property revenues for 2006 as compared to 2005 were impacted by increases in revenues in all markets these revenue increases were a result of an overall increase in average rental rates at our same store communities and increases in other property income 

total property expenses from our same store communities increased 24 and 55 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 and for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 respectively the increases in same store property expenses per apartment home for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 were primarily due to increases in repair and maintenance expenses and utility expenses in connection with our utility rebilling program discussed above the increases for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 were primarily due to increases in salary and benefit expenses real estate tax expenses and utilities expenses

fee and asset management expense which represents expenses related to thirdparty construction and development projects and property management decreased 48 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased 25 million for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily as a result of the timing of costs and cost overruns recognized on third party construction and development projects during each period and a higher level of thirdparty construction activity in 2006 as compared to 2007 and 2005 

general and administrative expenses decreased 50 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased 127 million during the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 and were 51 61 and 45 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to reduced legal and incentive compensation expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to costs associated with increases in salary and benefit expenses including longterm incentive compensation and amortization expense recorded for share awards acceleration of vesting of previously granted share awards and legal costs during 2006 an aggregate of 76542 share awards that otherwise would have vested from time to time over the next five years became immediately exercisable by accelerating the vesting of these share awards we recognized a onetime expense of approximately 42 million for the year ended december 31 2006

interest expense for the year ended 2007 decreased 16 million as compared to 2006 factors contributing to the decrease in interest expense include repayment of debt from proceeds received from our july 2006 equity offering property dispositions during both periods and interest adjustments related to tax liabilities partially offsetting this decrease was interest incurred on debt used to repurchase our common shares during 2007 while our average debt level outstanding during 2007 increased slightly as compared to 2006 we continued to fund construction costs associated with our development pipeline increasing interest capitalized by 20 million during 2007 as compared to 2006 interest expense for 2006 increased 68 million over 2005 primarily as a result of increases in debt outstanding and increases in the effective interest rates associated with our variable rate debt these increases were partially offset by repayment of debt from proceeds received from our july 2006 equity offering and property dispositions interest capitalized for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 31 million over the same period in 2005

other 

 

 

gain on sale of properties for the year ended december 31 2006 included gains of 915 million from the partial sale of nine operating properties to an affiliated joint venture and 52 million from the partial sales of land to affiliated joint ventures also included in gain on sale of properties for the year ended december 31 2006 was 08 million from the sale of undeveloped land to an unaffiliated third party gain on sale of properties for the year ended december 31 2005 included a gain of 1321 million from the partial sale of 12 operating communities to affiliated joint ventures and 08 million from the sale of undeveloped land to an unaffiliated third party see further discussion of gains associated with property dispositions in “property portfolio” 

the impairment loss on land for the year ended december 31 2007 of 14 million coincided with our decision to abandon development efforts at a site located in dallas texas prior to our decision to abandon efforts the carrying value of the land was supportable with cash flow projections from expected development while no determination has been made to dispose of the asset we have written down previously recorded carrying costs to record the asset at fair market value during 2005 we sold undeveloped land to an unrelated third party in connection with our decision to sell this undeveloped land we recognized an impairment loss of 03 million 

equity in income of joint ventures decreased 36 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 and decreased 49 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 changes from period to period are due to changes in the number of properties and gains recognized on the sale of assets held through joint ventures during 2007 certain of our development joint ventures completed construction and as such depreciation recorded during the period was greater than income recognized as these properties have not reached stabilization we recognized 28 million of gains for our proportionate share of the sale of three properties held through a joint venture during the year ended december 31 2006 during the year ended december 31 2005 we recognized 112 million in gains for our proportionate share of the sale of three properties held in joint ventures the gains recognized during the year ended december 31 2005 were partially offset by losses of 20 million recognized in one joint venture due to debt retirement costs associated with the refinancing of debt 

income allocated to common units and other minority interests decreased 110 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased 140 million during the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 income allocated to common units in 2006 was due primarily to gains recognized on the partial sale of eight properties held in camden operating lp to a joint venture during the year ended december 31 2006 a portion of the gains recognized were allocated to minority interest holders in camden operating lp 

income tax expense for year ended december 31 2007 was 31 million income tax expense is comprised of 10 million in margin taxes 05 million in federal income taxes on our taxable reit subsidiaries and 16 million in state taxes in our operating partnerships 

funds from operations “ffo” 

management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties real estate depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including minority interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 

  29 

we believe in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and data included elsewhere in this report ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income to diluted ffo for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 are as follows 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility which we believe enhances our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

 

our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was 30 29 and 28 times for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our interest expense coverage ratio is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of income from continuing operations before gain on sale of properties equity in income of joint ventures and minority interests depreciation amortization interest expense and income from discontinued operations at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 816 805 and 788 respectively of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered our weighted average maturity of debt excluding our line of credit was 49 years at december 31 2007 

  30 

as a result of the significant cash flow generated by our operations the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments and access to the capital markets by issuing securities under our automatic shelf registration statement we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs during 2008 including 

 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit used to fund development and acquisition activities during 2008 approximately 2006 million of secured mortgage notes are scheduled to mature additionally as of december 31 2007 we had several current development projects in various stages of construction for which a total estimated cost of 1192 million remained to be funded we intend to meet our longterm liquidity requirements through the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement draws on our unsecured credit facility property dispositions and secured mortgage notes 

in december 2007 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of 069 per share to holders of record as of december 21 2007 of our common shares the dividend was subsequently paid on january 17 2008 we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annualized dividend rate of 276 per share or unit 

in april 2007 our board of trust managers approved a program to repurchase up to 2500 million of our common equity securities through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions in january 2008 our board of trust managers approved the repurchase of up to an additional 2500 million of our common equity securities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 2231 million during the year ended december 31 2007 from 2316 million for the same period in 2006 the decrease was due to a decline in nonproperty income and timing of payments on trade payables and receivables offset by growth in revenues from our stabilized and development communities 

cash flows used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2007 totaled 3468 million as compared to 521 million during the year ended december 31 2006 cash outflows for property development acquisition and capital improvements were 5008 million during 2007 as compared to 4443 million during 2006 proceeds received from sales of properties and technology investments sales of assets to joint ventures and joint venture distributions representing returns of investments totaled 1789 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 4452 million for the year ended december 31 2006 additionally during the year ended december 31 2006 notes receivable – affiliates increased 416 million as five mezzanine loans were provided to joint ventures 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 1236 million for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily as a result of 8080 million in proceeds from notes payable offset by repayment of balances outstanding on our line of credit of 910 million payments of 2134 million related to the payoff of two senior unsecured notes and one mortgage note 2005 million of common share repurchases and distributions paid to shareholders and minority interest holders of 1781 million net cash used in financing activities totaled 1800 million for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily as a result of the repayment of balances outstanding on our line of credit of 450 million payments of 2273 million related to the payoff of senior unsecured notes and one mortgage note and distributions paid to shareholders and minority interest holders of 1662 million the cash used in financing activities was partially offset by 2549 million of proceeds from the issuance of 36 million common shares in 2006 

financial flexibility 

we have a 600 million unsecured credit facility which matures in january 2010 the scheduled interest rate is based on spreads over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the prime rate the scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of 300 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations all of which we are in compliance 

  31 

our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2007 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 146 million and had 4704 million available under our unsecured line of credit 

as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit we from time to time borrow using competitively bid unsecured shortterm notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group such borrowings vary in term and pricing and are typically priced at interest rates below those available under the unsecured line of credit 

during both 2007 and 2006 we repaid 2000 million of maturing unsecured notes with effective interest rates of 56 and 68 respectively during 2007 we refinanced one of our maturing secured conventional mortgage notes which had a balance of 68 million and a variable interest rate at 731 the new note was for a principal amount of 90 million with a fixed interest rate of 60 and matures on august 1 2014 we also repaid one conventional mortgage note during 2006 totaling 131 million which had an interest rate of 76 we repaid all notes payable using proceeds available under our unsecured line of credit 

in connection with our partial sale of nine apartment communities to a joint venture during 2006 as discussed in note 8 “investments in joint ventures” in the notes to consolidated financial statements three variable rate taxexempt mortgage notes totaling 305 million were assumed by the joint venture 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 the weighted average interest rate on our floating rate debt which includes our unsecured line of credit was 50 and 54 respectively 

we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission during 2006 which became effective upon filing we may use the shelf registration statement to offer from time to time common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our declaration of trust provides that we may issue up to 110000000 shares of beneficial interest consisting of 100000000 common shares and 10000000 preferred shares as of december 31 2007 we had 65434369 common shares and no preferred shares outstanding under our declaration of trust 

in june 2006 we issued 36 million common shares at 7125 per share in a public equity offering under our shelf registration statement we used the net proceeds of 2549 million to reduce indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit and for general corporate purposes 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 

 

 

  32 

the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured thirdparty debt we are not committed to any additional funding on thirdparty debt in relation to our joint ventures we are committed to funding an additional 62 million under mezzanine loans provided to joint ventures we have guaranteed the repayment of the construction loans of five of our development joint ventures in an amount equal to our percentage interest in such joint ventures totaling 657 million we believe it is unlikely significant payments will be required under these guarantees see further discussion of our investments in various joint ventures in note 8 “investments in joint ventures” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from 6 to 15 months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse affects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those most important to the presentation of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we follow financial accounting and reporting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

principles of consolidation  our consolidated financial statements include our assets liabilities and operations and those of our whollyowned subsidiaries and partnerships we also make coinvestments with unrelated third parties and determine whether to consolidate or use the equity method of accounting for these ventures fasb interpretation no 46r “ consolidation of variable interest entities ” as revised and emerging issues task force no 0405 “ determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights ” are two of the primary sources of accounting guidance in this area in accordance with this accounting literature we will consolidate joint ventures determined to be variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary we will also consolidate any joint ventures that are not determined to be variable interest entities but where we exercise control over major operating decisions through substantive participating rights any entities that do not meet the criteria for consolidation but where we exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

income recognition  our rental and other property income is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned other property income consists primarily of utility rebillings and administrative application and other transactional fees charged to our residents our apartment homes are rented to residents on lease terms generally ranging from 6 to 15 months with monthly payments due in advance interest fee and asset management and all other sources of income are recognized as earned two of our properties are subject to rent control or rent stabilization operations of apartment properties acquired are recorded from the date of acquisition in accordance with the purchase method of accounting in management’s opinion due to the number of residents the type and diversity of submarkets in which the properties operate and the collection terms there is no significant concentration of credit risk 

cost capitalization real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development expenditures directly related to the development acquisition and improvement of real estate assets excluding internal costs relating to acquisitions of operating properties are capitalized at cost as land buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the balance sheet in properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straightline method of depreciation 

where possible we stage our construction to allow leasing and occupancy during the construction period which we believe minimizes the duration of the leaseup period following completion of construction our accounting policy related to properties in the development and leasing phase is all operating expenses associated with completed apartment homes are expensed

as discussed above carrying charges are principally interest and real estate taxes capitalized as part of properties under development and buildings and improvements capitalized interest was 226 million in 2007 206 million in 2006 and 175 million in 2005 capitalized real estate taxes were 35 million 26 million and 25 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we capitalize renovation and improvement costs we believe extend the economic lives capital expenditures subsequent to initial construction are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 20 years 

depreciation and amortization is computed over the expected useful lives of depreciable property on a straightline basis with lives generally as follows 

 

allocations of purchase price  upon the acquisition of real estate we allocate the purchase price between tangible and intangible assets which includes land buildings furniture and fixtures the value of inplace leases including above and below market leases and acquired liabilities when allocating the purchase price to acquired properties we allocated costs to the estimated intangible value of inplace leases and above or below market leases and to the estimated fair value of furniture and fixtures land and buildings on a value determined by assuming the property was vacant by applying methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of incomeproducing property depreciation and amortization is computed on a straightline basis over the remaining useful lives of the related assets the value of inplace leases and above or below market leases is amortized over the estimated average remaining life of leases inplace at the time of acquisition estimates of fair value of acquired debt are based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 

asset impairment longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with longlived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets generally when impairment exists the longlived asset is adjusted to its respective fair value 

we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows trends and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding such factors as market rents economies and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates in determining fair value management uses appraisals management estimates or discounted cash flow calculations we recorded impairment charges on land of 14 million and 03 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2005 our impairment charge in 2007 coincided with our decision to abandon development efforts at a site located in dallas texas prior to our decision to abandon development efforts the carrying value of the land was supportable with cash flow projections from expected development 

derivative instruments we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and we designate the financial instruments as cash flow hedges under the guidance of sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” sfas no 138 “ accounting for certain instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of statement no 133 ” and sfas 149 “ amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities ” these statements require every derivative instrument to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met for cash flow hedge relationships changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument deemed effective at offsetting the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive income for cash flow hedges where the cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative exceed the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item the ineffective portion is recognized in current period earnings all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value derivatives not qualifying for hedge treatment must be recorded at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings in the period of change we enter into derivative financial instruments from time to time but do not use them for trading or speculative purposes interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce the potential impact of changes in interest rates on variablerate debt 

  34 

we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in hedging the exposure to the hedged transaction’s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed and measured both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis we assess whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items we discontinue hedge accounting if a derivative is not determined to be highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge 

as of december 31 2007 we had 500 million in variable rate debt subject to cash flow hedges see note 12 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 

accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity reflects the effective portions of cumulative changes in the fair value of derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no “fin” 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 ” fin 48 prescribes a twostep process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step involves evaluation of a tax position to determine whether it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the second step involves measuring the benefit to recognize in the financial statements for those tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold 

we adopted fin 48 as of january 1 2007 if various tax positions related to certain real estate dispositions were not sustained upon examination we would have been required to pay a deficiency dividend and associated interest for prior years accordingly we decreased distributions in excess of net income as of january 1 2007 for the adoption impact of fin 48 by approximately 25 million our period of uncertainty with respect to these real estate dispositions expired during fiscal year 2007 and we recorded a net credit to interest expense of approximately 25 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the tax years ended december 31 2004 2005 and 2006 remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of december 31 2007 we believe we have no uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits requiring disclosure 

we may from time to time be assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results in the event we receive an assessment for interest andor penalties it will be classified in the financial statements as tax expense 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “ fair value measurements ” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the statement does not require new fair value measurements but is applied to the extent other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements the statement emphasizes fair value as a marketbased measurement which should be determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability we will be required to disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities the inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements on earnings or changes in net assets for the period sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 in february 2008 the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis we have adopted sfas no 157 effective january 1 2008 for financial assets and financial liabilities and do not expect this adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position but will enhance the level of disclosures for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

  35 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “ the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities ” which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis ie the fair value option which are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards the election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings additionally sfas no 159 allows for a onetime election for existing positions upon adoption with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we have adopted this standard effective january 1 2008 and have elected not to measure any of our current eligible financial assets or liabilities at fair value upon adoption however we do reserve the right to elect to measure future eligible financial assets or liabilities at fair value 

in september 2007 the fasb ratified emerging issues task force “eitf” issue 076 “ accounting for the sale of real estate subject to the requirements of fasb statement no 66 when the agreement includes a buysell clause” which clarifies that a buysell clause in and of itself does not constitute a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sale treatment under statement 66 eitf 076 applies prospectively to new arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” which replaces sfas no 141 “ business combinations” which among other things establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer entity recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed including intangibles and any noncontrolling interests in the acquired entity sfas no 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 we are currently evaluating what impact our adoption of sfas no 141r will have on our financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “ noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” sfas no 160 amends arb 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary it also amends certain of arb 51’s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of sfas no 141r sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 we are currently evaluating what impact our adoption of sfas no 160 will have on our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2007 and 2006 

 

 

we use variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we incur additional variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates would increase we believe such increases in interest expense as a result of inflation would not significantly impact our distributable cash flow 

for fixed rate debt interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common shareholders or cash flows conversely for floating rate debt interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common shareholders and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant 

  36 

holding other variables constant a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately 788 million the net income available to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt excluding debt effectively fixed by interest rate swap described below would be approximately 17 million holding all other variables constant 

we currently use interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable indebtedness not for trading or speculative purposes under swap agreements 

 

as of december 31 2007 the effect of our swap agreement was to fix the interest rate on 500 million of our variable rate debt had the swap agreement not been in place during 2007 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 03 million higher based on balances and reported interest rates through the year additionally if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher through 2007 and this swap agreement not been in place our annual interest cost would have been approximately 16 million higher 

because the counterparty providing the swap agreements is a major financial institution which has an aa or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group we have no reason to believe there is exposure at this time to a default by the counterparty provider

financial information about segments 

we are engaged in the ownership development construction and management of multifamily apartment communities as each of our apartment communities has similar economic characteristics residents and products and services our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment see the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for certain information required by item 1 

narrative description of business 

as of december 31 2006 we owned interests in operated or were developing 197 multifamily properties comprising 67631 apartment homes located in 13 states we had 3788 apartment homes under development at 11 of our multifamily properties including 1069 apartment homes at three multifamily properties owned through joint ventures 26 apartment homes at one operating property and several sites we intend to develop into multifamily apartment communities additionally three properties comprised of 930 apartment homes were designated as held for sale 

  

operating strategy 

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through property operations development and acquisitions achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies to produce consistent earnings growth 

  real estate investments and market balance we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of both development and acquisition opportunities in new markets which have healthy longterm fundamentals and strong growth projections these capabilities combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure allow us to concentrate our growth efforts towards selective development and acquisition opportunities to achieve our strategy of having a geographically and physically diverse portfolio of assets that meet the requirements of our residents we typically make physical improvements at our acquired properties such as new or enhanced landscaping design new or upgraded amenities and redesigned building structures which coupled with a strong focus on property management branding and marketing have resulted in attractive yields on acquired properties 

we continue to operate in our core markets in which we believe we have an advantage due to economies of scale we feel where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing several properties in the same market however in order to generate consistent earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital if we determine a property cannot meet long term earnings growth expectations 

we have recently expanded our development pipeline significantly and we expect selective development of new apartment properties will continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio for the next several years we use experienced onsite construction superintendents operating under the supervision of project managers and senior management to control the construction process risks inherent to developing real estate include zoning changes environmental matters and changes in economic conditions during the development process see the further discussion of risks associated with development and construction in our “risk factors” section 

  sophisticated property management we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services promote resident satisfaction and improve resident retention thereby reducing operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to their residents we attempt to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon operational results produced at their property rental rate increases and the level of lease renewals achieved 

  operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property net operating income during 2005 we completed the roll out of our webbased property management and revenue management systems these two systems have improved onsite operations and were a contributing factor in allowing us to increase rental rates substantially during a period of strong recovery in the united states economy lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so lease expirations are matched to each property’s seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to thirteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to ensure timely response to residents’ changing needs and a high level of satisfaction 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents charged 

employees 

at december 31 2006 we had approximately 1920 employees including executive administrative and community personnel 

qualification as a real estate investment trust 

as of december 31 2006 we met the qualification of a reit under sections 856860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” as a result we with the exception of our taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we meet certain requirements of the code 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks please note additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders and create refinancing risk 

substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from our multifamily communities as a result our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors including the following 

 

cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regards to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit this requirement limits the cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments on our debt we may need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or a refinancing may not occur on favorable terms either of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact occupancy or rental rates 

economic conditions may significantly affect apartment home occupancy or rental rates occupancy and rental rates in the markets in which we operate in turn may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results the risks that may affect conditions in these markets include the following 

 

national regional and local economic climates may be adversely affected should population or job growth slow to the extent either of these conditions occurs in the markets in which we operate market rents will likely be affected we could also face challenges adequately managing and maintaining our properties should we experience increased operating costs as a result we may experience a loss of rental revenues which may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to pay distributions to shareholders 

various changes could adversely impact the market price of our common shares 

the market price of our publicly traded common shares depends on various conditions the risks that may affect this market price include the following 

 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our property portfolio our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks that may increase our construction costs including the following 

 

 

we also develop and construct properties for unrelated third parties pursuant to guaranteed maximum price contracts the terms of these contracts require us to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and we assume the risk the time and costs associated with our performance may be greater than was anticipated as a result our profitability on guaranteed maximum price contracts is dependent on our ability to predict these factors accurately the time and costs may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond our control in addition the terms of these contracts generally require a warranty period which may have a duration of up to ten years during which we may be required to repair replace or rebuild a project in the event of a material defect 

our property acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected 

in the normal course of our business we continually evaluate a number of potential acquisitions and may acquire additional operating properties the success of our acquisition activities is subject to a number of risks including the following 

 

our inability to successfully implement our property acquisition strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders we expect other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds private investors and other apartment reits will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition 

difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility 

real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly especially when market conditions are poor this may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions in addition in order to maintain our status as a reit the code imposes restrictions on our ability to sell properties held fewer than four years which may cause us to incur losses thereby reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting distributions to shareholders 

we have significant debt which could have important consequences 

as of december 31 2006 we had outstanding debt of approximately 23 billion this indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 

we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon the market index in addition we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders 

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

we carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to coverage limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we are liable for costs to investigate and remove or remediate hazardous or toxic substances on or in our properties in some cases regardless of whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of these substances these costs and other costs of investigation remediation or removal of hazardous substances may be substantial also the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on a property or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent the property or use the property as collateral 

additionally we occasionally develop manage lease andor operate various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been or to be an operator of these properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs that could relate to hazardous or toxic substances 

over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at high rates therefore should we be named in a lawsuit regarding mold infiltration the amount of damages may not be fully covered under insurance 

tax matters including failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences 

we may not continue to qualify in the future as a reit the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit 

 

 

we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property at either the corporate or individual property levels any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

investments through joint ventures and partnerships involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly we may invest in a joint venture or partnership as a partner these investments involve risks including the possibility our partner may become insolvent our partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours or our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

the americans with disabilities act or ada the fair housing amendments act of 1988 or fhaa and other federal state and local laws generally require public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons although we believe our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with ada fhaa and other federal state and local laws 

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility we will fail to qualify as a reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares that may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares that might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income 

our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes available for rent or sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartments and increase or maintain rents 

we depend on our key personnel 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business 

as a large publiclytraded owner of multifamily properties we may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation which if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability that is material to our financial condition or results of operations

executive summary 

based on our results for the year ended december 31 2006 and the projected economic conditions we expect moderate growth during 2007 from the revenue generated by our stabilized communities the economic projections include meaningful job growth and population growth in a number of markets in which we operate and decreased housing demand due to rising interest rates resulting in multifamily apartment communities being an economically attractive alternative to purchasing a singlefamily home and positively affecting apartment housing demand 

we intend to continue to focus on our market balance investment strategy and to improve our portfolio mix through the acquisition and disposition of real estate assets we expect market concentration risk to be mitigated as our property operations are not centralized in any one market 

in positioning for future growth we intend to continue focusing on our development pipeline and maintain approximately 10 billion to 15 billion in our current and future development pipelines total projected capital costs and the commencement of future developments may be impacted by increasing construction costs and other factors

same store analysis 

camden same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 218 million or 69 from 2005 resulting primarily from higher rental income per apartment home same store property revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 increased 117 million or 37 from 2004 primarily from higher rental income per apartment home and decreased vacancy loss per apartment home our revenue growth is the result of improving market fundamentals resulting from growth in employment and population in the majority of our markets the increasing cost of ownership versus rental and rising interest rates and construction costs limiting new supply in addition we continue to believe our strong operating performance is not only the result of improving operating fundamentals but also the continued enhancements we are making to many of our operational components such as our webbased property management and revenue management systems we believe these enhancements have created efficiencies within our business and have allowed us to take advantage of improvements in the rental market 

total property expenses from our same store communities increased 55 and 33 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 and for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 2004 respectively the increases in same store property expenses per apartment home for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 were primarily due to increases in repair and maintenance salaries and utilities expenses these three expense categories represent approximately 60 of total operating costs for the year ended december 31 2006 and increased approximately 8 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increases for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 2004 were primarily due to increases in salary and benefit expenses real estate tax expenses and utilities expenses these three expense categories represent approximately 68 of total operating costs for the period and increased approximately 5 as compared to 2004 

the revenues and expenses related to summit same store communities represent the operations of those assets since february 28 2005 the effective time of the summit merger increases in revenues and expenses on summit same store communities for 2006 compared to 2005 and for 2005 compared to 2004 are due to our ownership of those assets for only a partial year beginning in 2005

equity in income of joint ventures decreased 49 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 and increased 97 million for the year december 31 2005 as compared to 2004 changes from period to period are due to an increase in the number of properties and gains recognized on the sale of assets held through joint ventures we recognized 28 million of gains on the sale of three properties held through a joint venture during the year ended december 31 2006 during the year ended december 31 2005 we recognized 112 million in gains on the sale of three properties held in joint ventures the gains recognized during the year ended december 31 2005 were partially offset by losses recognized in one joint venture due to debt retirement costs associated with the refinancing of debt totaling 20 million 

distributions on perpetual preferred units decreased 34 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of the redemption of 53 million series c preferred units in september 2004 and january 2005 original issuance costs of 04 million and 07 million were expensed in connection with these redemptions in 2005 and 2004 respectively

funds from operations “ffo” 

management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from depreciable operating property sales plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all dilutive convertible securities including convertible minority interests which are convertible into common shares we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 

we believe in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and data included elsewhere in this report ffo is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance additionally ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 

reconciliations of net income to diluted ffo for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 are as follows 

in thousands 

 

adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures included in ffo for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 includes net gains totaling 28 million and 112 million respectively from the sale of properties held in joint ventures included in the net gains recognized during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 are 05 million and 03 million respectively in prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of mortgages associated with the sold properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility which we believe enhances our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by 

 

 

our interest expense coverage ratio net of capitalized interest was 29 28 and 30 times for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively interest expense coverage ratio is derived by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of income from continuing operations before gain on sale of properties equity in income loss of joint ventures and minority interests depreciation amortization interest expense and income from discontinued operations at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 805 788 and 886 respectively of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered our weighted average maturity of debt excluding our line of credit was 47 years at december 31 2006 

as a result of the significant cash flow generated by our operations the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other shortterm borrowings proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments and access to the capital markets by issuing securities under our automatic shelf registration statement we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs during 2007 including 

 

one of our principal longterm liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit used to fund development and acquisition activities for unsecured notes we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of those notes will be repaid prior to maturity additionally as of december 31 2006 we had several development projects in various stages of construction for which a total estimated cost of 2086 million remained to be funded we intend to meet our longterm liquidity requirements through the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement draws on our unsecured credit facility and property dispositions 

in december 2006 we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of 066 per share to holders of record as of december 22 2006 of our common shares the dividend was subsequently paid on january 17 2007 we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annualized dividend rate of 264 per share or unit 

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 2316 million during the year ended december 31 2006 from 2008 million for the same period in 2005 the increases were primarily due to additional property revenues from recently acquired properties and growth in property revenues from our stabilized communities this increase was partially offset by the loss of property revenues due to sales of properties and other transactional expenses 

cash flows used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2006 totaled 521 million as compared to 2076 million during the year ended december 31 2005 we incurred 4631 million in property development acquisition and capital improvement costs during 2006 as compared to 3016 million during 2005 during the year ended december 31 2006 we paid 82 million of severance benefits associated with the summit merger notes receivable — affiliates increased 416 million as five mezzanine loans were provided to joint ventures formed during the year ended december 31 2006 proceeds received from sales of properties and technology investments sales of assets to joint ventures and joint venture distributions representing returns of investments totaled 4452 million for the year ended december 31 2006 investing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily consisted of transactions associated with the summit merger and expenditures related to real estate assets as we paid 5098 million in connection with the summit merger either as consideration paid at acquisition or for merger liabilities assumed these payments were ultimately funded using a portion of the proceeds received from the sales of properties and technology investments and distributions from joint ventures representing returns of investments which totaled an aggregate of 5557 million 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 1800 million for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily as a result of the repayment of our line of credit of 450 million payments of 2273 million related to the payoff of senior unsecured notes and one mortgage note and distributions to shareholders and minority interest holders 

of 1662 million the cash used in financing activities was partially offset by 2549 million of proceeds from the issuance of 36 million common shares net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 60 million primarily due to a net increase in our unsecured line of credit of 1950 million and proceeds from notes payable of 2484 million partially offset by the repayment of a secured credit facility assumed in our merger with summit of 1885 million the repayment of 798 million in notes payable and distributions to shareholders and minority interest holders and redemption of preferred units of 1658 million 

financial flexibility 

in january 2005 we entered into a credit agreement which increased our unsecured credit facility to 600 million with the ability to further increase it up to 750 million this 600 million unsecured line of credit was originally scheduled to mature in january 2008 in january 2006 we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement to extend the maturity by two years to january 2010 and to amend certain covenants the scheduled interest rate is based on spreads over the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the prime rate the scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates these bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of 300 million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations all of which we were in compliance with at december 31 2006 

our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line it does reduce the amount available at december 31 2006 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 311 million and had 3629 million available under our unsecured line of credit 

as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit we from time to time borrow using competitively bid unsecured shortterm notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group such borrowings vary in term and pricing and are typically priced at interest rates below those available under the unsecured line of credit 

during 2006 and 2005 we repaid 2000 million and 250 million respectively of maturing unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 68 and 36 respectively we also repaid one conventional mortgage note during 2006 totaling 131 million which had an interest rate of 76 additionally we repaid six conventional mortgage notes during 2005 totaling 408 million which had a weighted average interest rate of 73 we repaid all notes payable using proceeds available under our unsecured line of credit 

in connection with our partial sale of nine apartment communities to a joint venture during 2006 as discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements three variable rate taxexempt mortgage notes totaling 305 million were assumed by the joint venture 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 the weighted average interest rate on our floating rate debt which includes our unsecured line of credit was 54 and 45 respectively 

in june 2006 we issued 36 million common shares at 7125 per share in a public equity offering we used the net proceeds of 2549 million to reduce indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit and for general corporate purposes 

we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission during 2006 that became effective upon filing we may use the shelf registration statement to offer from time to time common shares preferred shares debt securities or warrants our declaration of trust provides that we may issue up to 110000000 shares of beneficial interest consisting of 100000000 common shares and 10000000 preferred shares as of december 31 2006 we had 65005959 common shares outstanding under our declaration of trust 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded with secured thirdparty debt we are not committed to any additional funding on thirdparty debt in relation to our joint ventures we are committed to funding an additional 90 million under mezzanine loans provided to joint ventures we have guaranteed our proportionate interest on construction loans in three of our development joint ventures see further discussion of our investments in various joint ventures in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

inflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from 6 to 13 months in an inflationary environment we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases the shortterm nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse affects of inflation 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are those most important to the presentation of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we follow financial accounting and reporting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

  income recognition our rental and other property income is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned other property income consists primarily of utility rebillings and administrative application and other transactional fees charged to our residents retail lease income is recorded on a straightline basis over the lease term including any construction period if we are determined not to be the owner of the tenant improvements interest fee and asset management and all other sources of income are recognized as earned 

  capital expenditures we capitalize renovation and improvement costs we believe extend the economic lives and enhance the earnings of the related assets capital expenditures including carpet appliances and hvac unit replacements subsequent to initial construction are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 20 years 

  accounting for joint ventures  we make coinvestments with unrelated third parties and are required to determine whether to consolidate or use the equity method of accounting for these ventures fasb interpretation no 46r “ consolidation of variable interest entities ” as revised and emerging issues task force no 0405 “ determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights ” are two of the primary sources of accounting guidance in this area appropriate application of these relatively complex rules requires substantial management judgment 

  asset impairment longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash 

flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows and costs to sell an impairment charge equal to the excess is recognized 

  cost capitalization real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development expenditures directly related to the development acquisition and improvement of real estate assets excluding internal costs relating to acquisitions of operating properties are capitalized at cost as land buildings and improvements indirect development costs including salaries and benefits and other related costs attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the balance sheet in properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed upon substantial completion of the apartment homes the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land respectively and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straightline method of depreciation 

where possible we stage our construction to allow leasing and occupancy during the construction period which we believe minimizes the duration of the leaseup period following completion of construction our accounting policy related to properties in the development and leasing phase is all operating expenses associated with completed apartment homes are expensed 

  allocations of purchase price  upon the acquisition of real estate we allocate the purchase price between tangible and intangible assets which includes land buildings furniture and fixtures the value of inplace leases including above and below market leases and acquired liabilities when allocating the purchase price to acquired properties we allocated costs to the estimated intangible value of inplace leases and above or below market leases and to the estimated fair value of furniture and fixtures land and buildings on a value determined by assuming the property was vacant by applying methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of incomeproducing property depreciation and amortization is computed on a straightline basis over the remaining useful lives of the related assets the value of inplace leases and above or below market leases is amortized over the estimated average remaining life of leases inplace at the time of acquisition estimates of fair value of acquired debt are based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 

  use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures our more significant estimates relate to determining the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisitions estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying value of our real estate assets estimates of the useful lives of our assets reserves related to coinsurance requirements under our property general liability and employee benefit insurance programs and estimates of expected losses of variable interest entities future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment also see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 

new accounting standards 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r”requiring the compensation cost relating to sharebased payments be recognized over their vesting periods in the income statement based on their estimated fair values in april 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “ sharedbased payment ” providing for a phasedin implementation process for sfas no 123r sfas no 123r is effective for all public entities in the first annual reporting period beginning after june 15 2005 we adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 using the modified prospective method the impact of adopting this pronouncement is discussed in note 12 “ sharebased compensation ” 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “ accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3 ” “sfas no 154” this pronouncement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and revises the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle sfas no 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so this pronouncement also requires changes to the method of depreciation amortization or depletion for longlived nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 

it does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements including those which are in a transition phase as of the effective date the adoption of sfas no 154 did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2005 the fasb issued emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 045 “ determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights ” eitf issue no 045 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls and should consolidate a limited partnership or a similar entity eitf issue no 045 was effective after june 29 2005 for all newly formed limited partnerships and for any preexisting limited partnerships that modify their partnership agreements after that date general partners of all other limited partnerships are required to apply the consensus no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 the adoption of eitf issue no 045 did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” 7891 “ interaction of aicpa statement of position 789 and eitf issue no 045 ” the eitf acknowledged the consensus in eitf issue no 045 conflicted with certain aspects of statement of position “sop” 789 “ accounting for investments in real estate ventures ” the eitf agreed with the assessment of whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership should be consistent for all limited partnerships irrespective of the industry within which the limited partnership operates accordingly the guidance in sop 789 was amended in fsp 7891 to be consistent with the guidance in eitf issue no 045 the effective dates for this fsp are the same as those mentioned above in eitf issue no 045 the adoption of fsp 7891 did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2006 the fasb issued fsp fasb interpretation “fin” 46r6 “ determining the variability to be considered in applying fasb interpretation no 46r ” fin 46r6 addresses how a reporting enterprise should determine variability associated with a variable interest entity or variable interests in an entity when applying the provisions of fin 46r and is effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2006 we will evaluate the impact of fin 46r6 at the time any reconsideration event occurs as defined by the provisions of fin 46r and for any new entities with which we become involved in future periods 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 ” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions fin 48 requires we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if the position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we have assessed the potential impact of fin 48 and our adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “ fair value measurements ” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the statement does not require new fair value measurements but is applied to the extent other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements the statement emphasizes fair value as a marketbased measurement which should be determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability we will be required to disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities the inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements on earnings or changes in net assets for the period sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we do not anticipate the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158  employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r ” which requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity sfas no 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position with limited exceptions this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 our adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 we use variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline to the extent we incur additional variable rate indebtedness our exposure to increases in interest rates in an inflationary period would increase we believe such increases in interest expense as a result of inflation would not significantly impact our distributable cash flow 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

  evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to securities exchange act “exchange act” rules 13a15 based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in our exchange act filings is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms

merger with summit properties inc 

  

on february 28 2005 summit properties inc “summit” was merged with and into camden summit inc one of our whollyowned subsidiaries “camden summit” pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of october 4 2004 the “merger agreement” as amended prior to the effective time of the merger summit was the sole general partner of summit properties partnership lp the “camden summit partnership” and at the effective time camden summit became the sole general partner of the camden summit partnership and the name of such partnership was changed to camden summit partnership lp as of february 28 2005 summit owned or held an ownership interest in 48 operating communities comprised of 15002 apartment homes with an additional 1834 apartment homes under construction in five new communities 

  

under the terms of the merger agreement summit stockholders had the opportunity to elect to receive cash or camden shares for their summit stock each stockholder’s election was subject to proration depending on the elections of all summit stockholders so that the aggregate amount of cash issued in the merger to summit’s stockholders equaled approximately 4363 million as a result of this proration summit stockholders electing camden shares received approximately 6383 of a camden share and 14177 in cash for each of their shares of summit common stock the final conversion ratio of the common shares was determined based on the average market price of our common shares over a five day trading period preceding the effective time of the merger fractional shares were paid in cash summit stockholders electing cash or who made no effective election received 3120 in cash for each of their summit shares in the merger we issued approximately 118 million common shares to summit stockholders 

  

in conjunction with the merger the limited partners in the camden summit partnership were offered on a unitbyunit basis the opportunity to redeem their partnership units for 3120 in cash without interest or to remain in the camden summit partnership following the merger at a unit valuation equal to 6687 of a camden common share the limited partner elections resulted in the redemption of 07 million partnership units for cash for an aggregate of 217 million and the issuance of 18 million partnership units the value of the common shares and partnership units issued was determined based on the average market price of our common shares for the five day period commencing two days prior to the announcement of the merger on october 4 2005 subsequent to the merger 01 million partnership units have been redeemed for 57 million 

  

  

operating strategy 

  

we believe producing consistent earnings growth through our property development and acquisition strategies in favorable markets achieving market balance and recycling capital are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies in our efforts to produce consistent earnings growth 

  

real estate investments and market balance we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of both development and acquisition opportunities in new markets that have healthy longterm fundamentals and strong growth projections this capability combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure allows us to concentrate our growth efforts towards selective development alternatives and acquisition opportunities these abilities are integral to our strategy of having a geographically and physically diverse portfolio of assets which will meet the needs of our residents through our merger with summit and development and disposition activities that occurred in 2005 we have increased our market presence in key markets such as southern california washington dc metro atlanta and southeast florida decreased our relative concentration in houston dallas and las vegas and expanded our development pipeline we believe that the physical improvements we have made at our acquired properties such as new or enhanced landscaping design new or upgraded amenities and redesigned building structures coupled with a strong focus on property management branding and marketing have resulted in attractive yields on acquired properties

  

in connection with our merger with summit we significantly expanded our development pipeline and we expect that selective development of new apartment properties will continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio for the next several years we use experienced on site construction superintendents operating under the supervision of project managers and senior management to control the construction process all development decisions are made from our corporate office risks inherent to developing real estate include zoning changes and environmental matters there is also the risk that certain assumptions concerning economic conditions may change during the development process see the further discussion of risks associated with development and construction in our “risk factors” section we believe we understand and effectively manage the risks associated with development and construction and these risks are justified by higher potential yields 

  

we continue to operate in markets where we have a concentration advantage due to economies of scale we feel that where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing several properties in the same market however in order to generate consistent earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital if we determine a property cannot meet long term earnings growth expectations we believe that recycling capital is an important aspect of maintaining the overall quality of our portfolio as a result of the transactions completed in 2005 we have a portfolio of newer higherquality communities in 22 markets with no single market contributing more than 10 of our net operating income for the year ended december 31 2005 washington dc metro dallas and tampa contributed 99 82 and 82 respectively to our net operating income 

  

sophisticated property management we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services thereby promoting resident satisfaction and improving resident retention which should reduce operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our on site personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to their residents we attempt to motivate our on site employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon the net operating income produced at their property rental rate increases and the level of lease renewals achieved property net operating income represents total property revenues less total property expenses

  

operations we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property net operating income during 2005 we completed the roll out of our web based property management and revenue management systems these two systems should improve onsite efficiency and allow us to take full advantage of the economic recovery that appears to be underway by achieving market driven rental rates lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so that lease expirations are better

  

  

matched to each property’s seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to thirteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to ensure we respond timely to residents’ changing needs and residents retain a high level of satisfaction 

  

branding we have implemented our strategic brand initiative and each of our communities carries the camden flagship name our brand promise of “living excellence” reinforces our reputation as an organization which promises excellence everywhere our customers look this initiative was undertaken with the goal of reinforcing our reputation as a provider of high quality apartment home living we continue to leverage our brand to increase market awareness and define who and what we are to our current and prospective residents

  

environmental matters under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we are liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in our properties these laws often impose liability without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances all of our properties have been subjected to phase i site assessments or similar environmental audits to determine the likelihood of contamination from either on or offsite sources these audits have been carried out in accordance with accepted industry practices we have also conducted limited subsurface investigations and tested for radon and leadbased paint where such procedures have been recommended by our consultants we cannot assure you that existing environmental studies reveal all environmental liabilities or that any prior owner did not create any material environmental condition not known to us the costs of investigation remediation or removal of hazardous substances may be substantial if hazardous or toxic substances are present on a property or if we fail to properly remediate such substances our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral may be adversely affected

  

insurance we maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future however there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes that may be subject to limitations in certain areas we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to fully replace or restore a property after it has been damaged or destroyed

our portfolio consists of middle to uppermarket apartment properties we target acquisitions and developments in selected markets since our initial public offering in 1993 we have diversified into markets in the southwest southeast midwest midatlantic and western regions of the united states by combining acquisition renovation and development capabilities we believe we can better respond to changing conditions in each market reduce market risk and take advantage of opportunities as they arise 

  

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes that are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located this competitive environment could have a material effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property as well as on the rents charged resident leases at our properties are priced competitively based on market conditions supply and demand characteristics and amenities provided to our residents

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 

  

  

rising interest rates would increase our costs and could affect the market price of our common shares 

  

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur debt in the future some of this debt has variable or floating interest rates accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also increase in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding common shares 

  

failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt service and pay distributions to shareholders and could adversely affect our ability to maintain our status as a reit 

  

the following factors among others may adversely affect the cash flows generated by our properties 

  

•   the national and local economic climates

  

•   local real estate market conditions such as an oversupply of apartment homes

  

•   the perceptions by prospective residents of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located

  

•   the need to periodically repair renovate and relet space and

  

•   our ability to pay for adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating costs including real estate taxes

  

some significant expenditures associated with each property such as mortgage payments if any real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when cash flows from operations from the property decrease 

  

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could hurt occupancy or rental rates 

  

the market and economic conditions may significantly affect apartment home occupancy or rental rates occupancy and rental rates in the markets in which we operate in turn may significantly affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and make distributions to security holders the risks that may affect conditions in these markets include the following 

  

•   the economic climate which may be adversely impacted by plant closings industry slowdowns and other factors

  

•   local conditions such as oversupply of apartments or a reduction in demand for apartments in an area

  

•   a future economic downturn that simultaneously affects more than one of our geographical markets

  

•   the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay their current rent or rent increases

  

•   the potential effect of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing which could prevent us from raising rents and

  

•   competition from other available apartments and changes in market rental rates

  

difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility 

  

real estate investments can be hard to sell especially if market conditions are poor this may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions in addition the internal 

  

  

revenue code limits our ability to sell properties that we have held for fewer than four years which may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting our return 

  

development and construction risks could impact our profitability 

  

we intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our own account our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks that may increase our construction costs this factor could adversely impact our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and make distributions to security holders these risks include the following 

  

•   we may be unable to obtain or may face delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs

  

•   we may incur construction costs for a property that exceed our original estimates due to increased materials labor or other costs or due to errors and omissions that occur in the design or construction process and we may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increases in these costs

  

•   occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in the community not being profitable

  

•   we may not be able to obtain financing with favorable terms for the development of a community which may make us unable to proceed with its development

  

•   we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a community on schedule which could result in increased costs

  

•   we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore and as a result may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring these development opportunities and

  

•   we rely on subcontractors to perform most of our construction activities and poor performance or defaults by a major subcontractor or our inability to obtain adequate performance bonds for a major subcontractor may lead to project delays and unanticipated additional costs

  

we also develop and construct properties for unrelated third parties pursuant to guaranteed maximum price contracts the terms of these contracts require us to estimate the time and costs to complete a project and we assume the risk that the time and costs associated with our performance may be greater than is anticipated as a result our profitability on guaranteed maximum price contracts is dependent on our ability to predict these factors accurately the time and costs may be affected by a variety of factors including those listed above many of which are beyond our control in addition the terms of these contracts generally require a warranty period which may be up to ten years long during which we may be required to repair replace or rebuild a project in the event of a material defect in the structure of the project if we do not accurately predict the time and costs of guaranteed maximum price contracts for particular projects or if the costs of the warranty work exceed the amounts reserved for these matters we could suffer losses on those projects and our profitability could be less than anticipated 

  

  

failure to implement our property acquisition strategy could impact our profitability 

  

in the normal course of our business we continually evaluate a number of potential acquisitions and may acquire additional operating properties our inability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy could result in our market penetration decreasing which could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and make distributions to shareholders our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to a number of risks including the following 

  

•   we may not be able to identify properties to acquire or effect the acquisition

  

•   we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations

  

•   our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate and

  

•   the acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment

  

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had outstanding debt of approximately 26 billion this indebtedness could have important consequences for example 

  

•   if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the mortgage

  

•   if cash flow from operations is less than the required principal and interest payments on our existing indebtedness which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity we might not be able to refinance the debt or the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness

  

•   our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions could be increased and

  

•   our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry could be limited

  

issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition 

  

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties dividend payment rates to our shareholders development and capital expenditures costs of operations and potential acquisitions we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated accordingly we could become more leveraged resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

  

losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage 

  

we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future however some losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods hurricanes or earthquakes may be subject to limitations we exercise our discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

  

  

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we are liable for the costs to investigate and remove or remediate hazardous or toxic substances on or in our properties often regardless of whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of these substances these costs may be substantial also if hazardous or toxic substances are present on a property or if we fail to properly remediate such substances our ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow using that property as collateral may be adversely affected 

  

additionally we occasionally develop manage lease andor operate various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been or to be an operator of these properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs that could relate to hazardous or toxic substances 

  

over the past several years there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates 

  

comp l iance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 

  

the americans with disabilities act or ada the fair housing amendments act of 1988 or fhaa and other federal state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants these laws may require us to modify our existing properties these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons although we believe our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with the ada fhaa and other federal state and local laws 

  

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly lower funds available for distribution to shareholders 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be taxed as a corporation the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years and new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal tax consequences of such qualification 

  

for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates plus any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost this treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved in addition distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve reit status we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a reit 

  

share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders 

  

for us to maintain our qualification as a reit not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes the term “individuals” includes a number of specified entities to minimize the possibility that we will fail to qualify as a 

  

  

reit under this test our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits the ownership limits as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities may delay defer or prevent a change in control these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares that may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares that might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction 

  

we make mezzanine loans that involve risk of loss 

  

we have made and may continue to make mezzanine loans to various third parties which are typically secured by multifamily residential real estate and are subordinate to senior mortgages while these loans are outstanding we are subject to risks of borrower defaults bankruptcies fraud and other losses in the event of any default under mezzanine loans held by us we will bear the risk of loss of principal and nonpayment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the loan collateral and the principal amount of the loan in addition mezzanine loans involve a higher degree of risk that we may not recover some or all of our investment than senior mortgages due to a variety of factors including the loan becoming unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender 

  

increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rents 

  

our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent or sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartments and increase or maintain rents 

  

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

  

we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits may have greater resources than we do this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue as a result we may not be able or have the opportunity to make suitable investments on favorable terms in the future this could adversely affect our profitability 

  

we depend on our key personnel   our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

  

changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business   we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate taxes income taxes or other taxes consequently any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and make distributions to security holders changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance could have the same impact 

  

as a large publicly traded owner of multifamily properties we may become involved in legal proceedings including consumer employment tort or commercial litigation that if decided adversely to or settled by us could result in liability that is material to our financial condition or results of operations

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as follows 

  

a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of trust managers management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

•   pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company

  

•   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and

  

  

•   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

  

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 

  

based on our assessment management concluded our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december 31 2005 

  

deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 deloitte  touche llp’s attestation report regarding the effectiveness of management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting is included herein 

  

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of trust managers and the shareholders of camden property trust 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that camden property trust and subsidiaries the “trust” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the trust’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the trust’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the trust maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 of the trust and our reports dated march 8 2006 expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

 item 1 business introduction camden property trust is a real estate investment trust organized on may 25 1993 and with our subsidiaries reports as a single business segment we are one of the largest real estate investment trusts in the nation with operations related to the ownership development construction and management of multifamily apartment communities in ten states as of december 31 2003 we owned interests in operated or were developing 146 properties containing 52346 apartment homes geographically dispersed in the sunbelt and midwestern markets from florida to california two of our newly developed multifamily properties containing 786 apartment homes were in leaseup at year end two of our multifamily properties containing 1002 apartment homes were under development at december 31 2003 including 464 apartment homes owned through a joint venture we also have several sites that we intend to develop into multifamily apartment communities 

2003 operating results our 2003 results reflect the difficult operating fundamentals in our industry including an oversupply of multifamily housing low interest rates on mortgage debt which continue to make home purchases attractive and a slow economic recovery during 2003 apartment turnover due to home purchases was at the highest level in our history despite these challenges overall occupancy in our portfolio increased during 2003 the increase in occupancy was achieved in part by offering higher concessions in many of our markets as a result we experienced a 13 decline in revenues from our samestore communities during the year total revenues for 2003 increased slightly as income from newly developed communities offset the decline in revenues from our samestore communities and 2002 dispositions 

we continued to focus on expense control in 2003 expenses at our samestore communities increased 47 during 2003 after increasing only 11 in 2002 the increase in 2003 expenses was driven by increases in property insurance expense real estate taxes repair and maintenance costs and normal increases in employee related expenses we were able to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment in 2003 and these savings should continue as we replace maturing debt with new lower cost debt 

although we expect 2004 to remain a challenging economic environment we believe we are well positioned for growth our average borrowing costs should continue to decline as a result of the replacement of higher priced maturing debt additionally our operating results should be positively impacted by the increase in the occupancy levels of our portfolio and increases in contributions from our california and houston development properties 

at december 31 2003 we had 1714 employees our headquarters are located at 3 greenway plaza suite 1300 houston texas 77046 and our telephone number is 713 3542500 

operating strategy we believe that producing consistent earnings growth and selectively investing in favorable markets are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies in our efforts to produce consistent earnings growth 

  new development and acquisitions  we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of both development and acquisition opportunities in certain markets that have healthy longterm fundamentals and strong growth projections this capability combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure allows us to concentrate our growth efforts towards selective development alternatives and acquisition opportunities these abilities are key to our strategy of having a geographically and physically diverse pool of assets which will meet the needs of our residents we believe that the physical improvements we have made at our acquired properties such as new or enhanced landscaping design new or upgraded amenities and redesigned building structures coupled with a strong focus on property management branding and marketing have resulted in attractive yields on acquired properties 

we expect that selective development of new apartment properties will continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio for the next several years we use experienced onsite construction superintendents operating under the supervision of project managers and senior management to control the construction process all 

development decisions are made from our corporate office risks inherent to developing real estate include zoning changes and environmental matters there is also the risk that certain assumptions concerning economic conditions may change during the development process we believe we understand and effectively manage the risks associated with development and the risks of new development are justified by higher potential yields 

  sophisticated property management  we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services thereby promoting resident satisfaction and improving resident retention which should reduce operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to their residents we attempt to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon the net operating income produced at their property rental rate increases and the level of lease renewals achieved property net operating income represents total property revenues less total property expenses 

  operating strategies  we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property net operating income lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so that lease expirations are better matched to each property’s seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to thirteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to ensure we respond timely to residents’ changing needs and to ensure that residents retain a high level of satisfaction 

  branding we have implemented our strategic brand initiative and each of our communities now carries the camden flagship name our brand promise of “living excellence” reinforces our reputation as an organization that promises excellence everywhere our customers look this initiative was undertaken with the goal of reinforcing our reputation as a provider of high quality apartment home living these actions were designed to leverage our brand to increase market awareness and define who and what we are to our current and prospective residents we believe the successful implementation of our brand initiative will continue to generate longterm value for us and our shareholders 

  dispositions we continue to operate in markets where we have a concentration advantage due to economies of scale we feel that where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing several properties in the same market however in order to generate consistent earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations we also intend to continue rebalancing our portfolio with the goal of limiting any one market to providing no more than 10 of total net operating income our strategy regarding undeveloped land sales has been to integrate the residential and retail components in such a way that enhances the quality of life for our residents 

as of december 31 2003 we had operating properties in 16 markets no single market contributed more than 15 of our net operating income for the year then ended for the year ended december 31 2003 houston dallas and las vegas contributed 144 139 and 138 respectively of our net operating income 

  environmental matters  under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we are liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in our properties these laws often impose liability without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances all of our properties have been subjected to phase i site assessments or similar environmental audits to determine the likelihood of contamination from either on or offsite sources these audits have been carried out in accordance with accepted industry practices we have also conducted limited subsurface investigations and tested for radon and leadbased paint where such procedures have been recommended by our consultants we cannot assure you that existing environmental studies reveal all environmental liabilities or that any prior owner did not create any material environmental condition not known to us the costs of investigation remediation or removal of hazardous substances may be substantial if hazardous or toxic substances are present on a property or if we fail to properly remediate such substances our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral may be adversely affected 

  insurance we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future however there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods or earthquakes that may be subject to limitations in certain areas we exercise our 

discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

markets and competition our portfolio consists of middle to uppermarket apartment properties we target acquisitions and developments in selected markets since our initial public offering in 1993 we have diversified into markets in the southwest southeast midwest and western regions of the united states by combining acquisition renovation and development capabilities we believe we can better respond to changing conditions in each market reduce market risk and take advantage of opportunities as they arise 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties and single family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which our properties are located our properties also compete for residents with the new and existing ownedhome market the demand for rental housing is driven by economic and demographic trends recent trends in the economics of renting versus home ownership indicate an increasing demand for owned housing in certain markets due to a number of factors including the decrease in mortgage interest rates

 item 1 business 

introduction 

  camden property trust is a real estate investment trust organized on may 25 1993 and with our subsidiaries reports as a single business segment we are one of the largest real estate investment trusts in the nation with operations related to the ownership development construction and management of multifamily apartment communities in nine states as of december 31 2002 we owned interests in operated or were developing 147 properties containing 52274 apartment homes geographically dispersed in the sunbelt and midwestern markets from florida to california our properties excluding properties in leaseup and under development had a weighted average occupancy rate of 92 for the year ended december 31 2002 this rate represents the average occupancy for all of our properties in 2002 weighted by the number of apartment homes in each property two of our newly developed multifamily properties containing 718 apartment homes were in leaseup at year end four of our multifamily properties containing 1484 apartment homes were under development at december 31 2002 we also have several sites which we intend to develop into multifamily apartment communities 

  at december 31 2002 we had 1723 employees our headquarters are located at 3 greenway plaza suite 1300 houston texas 77046 and our telephone number is 713 3542500 

operating strategy 

  we believe that producing consistent earnings growth and selectively investing in favorable markets are crucial factors to our success we rely heavily on our sophisticated property management capabilities and innovative operating strategies in our efforts to produce consistent earnings growth 

  sophisticated property management   we believe the depth of our organization enables us to deliver quality services thereby promoting resident satisfaction and improving resident retention which should reduce operating expenses we manage our properties utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel including certified property managers experienced apartment managers and leasing agents and trained apartment maintenance technicians our onsite personnel are trained to deliver high quality services to their residents we attempt to motivate our onsite employees through incentive compensation arrangements based upon the net operating income produced at their property as well as rental rate increases and the level of lease renewals achieved property net operating income represents total property revenues less total property expenses 

  operating strategies we believe an intense focus on operations is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident satisfaction increasing rents as market conditions allow maximizing rent collections maintaining property occupancy at optimal levels and controlling operating costs comprise our principal strategies to maximize property net operating income lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure by apartment type so that lease expirations are better matched to each property’s seasonal rental patterns we generally offer leases ranging from six to thirteen months with individual property marketing plans structured to respond to local market conditions in addition we conduct ongoing customer service surveys to ensure we respond timely to residents changing needs and to ensure that residents retain a high level of satisfaction 

  branding we have implemented our strategic brand initiative and each of our communities now carries the camden flagship name our brand promise of “living excellence” reinforces our reputation as an organization that promises excellence everywhere our customers look this initiative was undertaken with the goal of reinforcing our reputation as a provider of high quality apartment home living these actions were designed to leverage our brand to increase market awareness and define who and what we are to our current and prospective residents we believe the successful implementation of our brand initiative will continue to generate longterm value for us and our shareholders 

  new development and acquisitions we believe we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of both development and acquisition opportunities which have healthy longterm fundamentals and strong growth projections this capability combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure allows us to concentrate our growth efforts towards selective development alternatives and acquisition opportunities these abilities are key to forwarding our strategy to have a geographically and physically diverse pool of assets which will meet the needs of our residents we believe that the physical improvements we have made at our acquired properties such as new or enhanced landscaping design new or upgraded amenities and redesigned building structures coupled with a strong focus on property management and marketing has resulted in attractive yields on acquired properties 

  we expect that selective development of new apartment properties will continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio for the next several years we use experienced onsite construction superintendents operating under the supervision of project managers and senior management to control the construction process all development decisions are made from our corporate office risks inherent to developing real estate include zoning changes and environmental matters there is also the risk that certain assumptions concerning economic conditions may change during the development process we believe that we understand and effectively manage the risks associated with development and that the risks of new development are justified by higher potential yields 

  our consolidated financial statements include 2856 million related to properties under development including land of this amount 1568 million relates to our four development projects currently under construction additionally we have 1288 million invested in land held for future development included in this amount is 727 million relating to projects we expect to begin constructing throughout 2003 we also have 359 million invested in land tracts adjacent to current development projects which are being utilized in conjunction with those projects upon completion of these current development projects we expect to utilize this land to further develop apartment homes in these areas we may also sell certain parcels of these undeveloped land tracts to third parties for commercial and retail development 

  dispositions   we continue to operate in markets where we have a concentration advantage due to economies of scale we feel that where possible it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing several properties in the same market however in order to generate consistent earnings growth we intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital if we determine a property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations we also intend to continue rebalancing our portfolio with the goal of limiting any one market to providing no more than 12 of total net operating income our strategy regarding the undeveloped land sales has been to integrate the residential and retail components in such a way that enhances the quality of life for our residents 

  environmental matters   under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we are liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in our properties these laws often impose liability without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances all of our properties have been subjected to phase i site assessments or similar environmental audits to determine the likelihood of contamination from either on or offsite sources these audits have been carried out in accordance with accepted industry practices we have also conducted limited subsurface investigations and tested for radon and leadbased paint where such procedures have been recommended by our consultants we cannot assure you that existing environmental studies reveal all environmental liabilities or that any prior owner did not create any material environmental condition not known to us the costs of investigation remediation or removal of hazardous substances may be substantial if hazardous or toxic substances are present on a property or if we fail to properly remediate such substances our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral may be adversely affected 

  insurance   we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets we intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future however there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods or earthquakes that may be subject to limitations in certain areas our board exercises its discretion in determining amounts coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms if we suffer a substantial loss our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 

markets and competition 

  our portfolio consists of middle to upper market apartment properties we target acquisitions and developments in selected markets since our initial public offering in 1993 we have diversified into other markets in the southwest southeast midwest and western regions of the united states by combining acquisition renovation and development capabilities we believe we can better respond to changing conditions in each market reduce market risk and take advantage of opportunities as they arise 

  there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our properties in attracting residents our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties and single family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which our properties are located our properties also compete for residents with the new and existing ownedhome market the demand for rental housing is driven by economic and demographic trends recent trends in the economics of renting versus home ownership indicate an increasing demand for owned housing in certain markets due to a number of factors including the decrease in mortgage interest rates

operating strategy

     we believe  that  producing  consistent  earnings  growth  and  selectively
investing  in  favorable  markets are crucial  factors to our  success  we rely
heavily on our  sophisticated  property  management  capabilities and innovative
operating strategies in our efforts to produce consistent earnings growth

     sophisticated property management we believe the depth of our organization
enables us to deliver quality services  thereby promoting resident satisfaction
and improving resident  retention  which should reduce operating  expenses  we
manage our properties  utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel
including  certified  property  managers  experienced  apartment  managers  and
leasing  agents  and trained  apartment  maintenance  technicians  our onsite
personnel are trained to deliver high quality  services to their  residents  we
attempt  to  motivate  our  onsite  employees  through  incentive  compensation
arrangements based upon the net operating income produced at their property  as
well as rental rate increases and the level of lease renewals achieved property
net operating income represents total property revenues less property  operating
and maintenance expenses including real estate taxes

     operating  strategies  we  believe  an  intense  focus  on  operations  is
necessary to realize  consistent  sustained earnings growth  ensuring resident
satisfaction  increasing  rents as market  conditions  allow  maximizing  rent
collections  maintaining  property  occupancy at optimal levels and controlling
operating  costs  comprise our  principal  strategies  to maximize  property net
operating income  lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure
by  apartment  type  so  that  lease  expirations  are  better  matched  to each
propertys  seasonal  rental  patterns  we  offer  leases  ranging  from six to
thirteen months  with individual property marketing plans structured to respond
to local market  conditions  in addition  we conduct ongoing  customer service
surveys to ensure we respond  timely to residents  changing  needs and to ensure
that residents retain a high level of satisfaction

     branding   in  2001  we  began  implementation  of  our  strategic  brand
initiative  and each of our  communities  now carries the camden flagship name
our brand  promise  of  living  excellence  reinforces  our  reputation  as an
organization  that  promises  excellence  everywhere  our customers  look  this
initiative  was  undertaken  to reinforce  our  reputation as a provider of high
quality  apartment  home living  these  actions  leverage our brand to increase
market  awareness and define who and what we are to our current and  prospective
residents  we believe these actions will create  longterm value for us and our
shareholders

     new development and acquisitions  we believe we are well positioned in our
current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of both development and
acquisition  opportunities which have healthy longterm  fundamentals and strong
growth  projections  this dual  capability  combined with what we believe is a
conservative  financial  structure  allows us to concentrate our growth efforts
towards selective  development  alternatives and acquisition  opportunities  we
believe that the physical  improvements we have made at our acquired properties
such as new or  enhanced  landscaping  design  new or  upgraded  amenities  and
redesigned  building  structures  coupled  with  a  strong  focus  on  property
management  and  marketing  has  resulted  in  attractive  yields  on  acquired

     selective  development  of new  apartment  properties  will  continue to be
important  to the growth of our  portfolio  for the next several  years  we use
experienced   onsite   construction   superintendents   operating   under  the
supervision  of  project  managers  and  senior   management   to  control  the
construction  process  all  development  decisions  are made from our corporate
office  risks  inherent to developing  real estate  include  zoning changes and
environmental   matters  there  is  also  the  risk  that  certain  assumptions
concerning  economic  conditions may change during the development  process  we
believe that we understand  and  effectively  manage the risks  associated  with
development  and that the  risks of new  development  are  justified  by  higher
potential yields

     our  consolidated  financial  statements  include 1436 million related to
properties currently under development of this amount 462 million relates to
our two current  development  projects  camden  harbour  view in long beach and
camden  vineyards in southern  california  additionally  we have 974 million
invested in land held for future  development  included in this amount is 518
million in land development projects located in houston dallas and long beach
we are  currently in the  planning  phase with  respect to these  properties  to
further develop apartment homes in these areas we may also sell certain parcels
of undeveloped land to third parties for commercial and retail development

     dispositions   we  continue  to  operate  in  markets   where  we  have  a
concentration  advantage due to economies of scale we feel that where possible
it is best to operate with a strong base of  properties in order to benefit from
the  personnel  allocation  and the market  strength  associated  with  managing
several properties in the same market  however in order to generate consistent
earnings growth we will seek to selectively  dispose of properties and redeploy
capital if we  determine  a  property  cannot  meet  longterm  earnings  growth
expectations we also intend to continue rebalancing our portfolio with the goal
of limiting any one market to providing no more than 12 of total net  operating
income  our strategy regarding the undeveloped land sales has been to integrate
the residential and retail components in such a way that enhances the quality of
life for our residents

     environmental  matters  under  various  federal  state  and  local  laws
ordinances  and  regulations  we  are  liable  for  the  costs  of  removal  or
remediation of certain  hazardous or toxic  substances on or in our  properties
these laws often impose liability  without regard to whether we knew of or were
responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic  substances  all of our
properties  have  been  subjected  to  phase  i  site   assessments  or  similar
environmental audits to determine if there is a likelihood of contamination from
either on or offsite sources these audits have been carried out in accordance
with accepted  industry  practices  we have also conducted  limited  subsurface
investigations  and tested for radon and leadbased  paint where such procedures
have been  recommended  by our  consultants  we cannot assure you that existing
environmental  studies  reveal all  environmental  liabilities or that any prior
owner did not create any material  environmental  condition not known to us the
costs of  investigation  remediation or removal of hazardous  substances may be
substantial  if hazardous or toxic substances are present on a property  or if
we fail to properly remediate such substances  our ability to sell or rent such
property  or to borrow  using  such  property  as  collateral  may be  adversely
affected

     insurance we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage
and rental loss insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and
amount customarily obtained on real property assets we intend to obtain similar
coverage for  properties  we acquire in the future  however  there are certain
types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods
or earthquakes  that may be subject to limitations in certain areas  our board
exercises  its  discretion  in   determining   amounts   coverage   limits  and
deductibility  provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining  appropriate
insurance on our  investments at a reasonable  cost and on suitable terms if we
suffer a substantial  loss our insurance  coverage may not be sufficient to pay
the  full  current  market  value  or  current  replacement  cost  of  our  lost
investment  inflation changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental
considerations  and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance
proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed

target acquisitions and developments in selected highgrowth markets  since our
initial public offering in 1993 we have  diversified  into other markets in the
southwest  region and into the  southeast  midwest and  western  regions of the
united   states   by  combining   acquisition   renovation   and   development
capabilities  we believe we can better  respond to changing  conditions in each
market reduce market risk and take advantage of opportunities as they arise

attracting  residents  our properties  compete directly with other  multifamily
properties and single family homes that are available for rent in the markets in
which our properties are located our properties also compete for residents with
the new and existing  ownedhome market the demand for rental housing is driven
by economic and  demographic  trends  recent trends in the economics of renting

markets due to a number of factors including the decrease in mortgage interest
rates  rental  demand  should  be  strong in areas  anticipated  to  experience
inmigration  due to the younger ages that  characterize  movers as well as the
relatively high cost of home ownership in higher growth areas

     management  believes  that we  possess  the  development  capabilities  and
experience  to  provide a  continuing  source  of  portfolio  growth  in making
development decisions  management considers a number of factors  including the
size of the property  the season in which  leasing  activity will occur and the
extent to which  delivery of the  completed  apartment  homes will coincide with
leasing and  occupancy of such  apartment  homes which is dependent  upon local
market conditions  in order to pursue a development opportunity  we currently
require a minimum initial  stabilized target return of 90100  this minimum
target  return  is based on  projected  market  rents and  projected  stabilized
expenses considering the market and the nature of the prospective development



item 3 legal proceedings

     prior to our merger with oasis  residential  inc in 1998  oasis had been
contacted by certain  regulatory  agencies  with regards to alleged  failures to
comply with the fair housing  amendments act as it pertained to nine  properties
seven of which we currently own  constructed  for first  occupancy after march
31 1991 on february 1 1999 the justice department filed a lawsuit against us
and  several  other  defendants  in the  united  states  district  court for the
district  of nevada  alleging  1 that the  design  and  construction  of these
properties  violates  the fair  housing act and 2 that we  through the merger
with oasis  had  discriminated in the rental of dwellings to persons because of
handicap the complaint requests an order that i declares that the defendants
policies and  practices  violate the fair housing act  ii enjoins us from a
failing or refusing  to the extent  possible  to bring the dwelling  units and
public use and common use areas at these properties and other covered units that
oasis had designed andor constructed into compliance with the fair housing act
b failing or refusing to take such  affirmative  steps as may be  necessary to
restore  as nearly as possible  the alleged victims of the defendants  alleged
unlawful   practices  to  positions   they  would  have  been  in  but  for  the
discriminatory   conduct  and  c   designing  or   constructing   any  covered
multifamily  dwellings in the future that do not contain the  accessibility and
adaptability  features set forth in the fair housing act and requires us to pay
damages including punitive damages and a civil penalty

     with any  acquisition  we plan for and  undertake  renovations  needed  to
correct deferred  maintenance  lifesafety and fair housing matters on january
30  2001  a consent  decree was  ordered  and  executed  in the above  justice
department  action  under  the terms of the  decree  we were  ordered  to make
certain  retrofits and implement certain  educational  programs and fair housing
advertising  these  changes  are to take  place  over the next five  years  in
managements  opinion  the costs  associated with complying with the decree are
not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements

ordinary course of business  these matters are generally  covered by insurance
while the  resolution  of these  matters  cannot be  predicted  with  certainty

introduction

     camden  property  trust  is a  real  estate  investment  trust  that  owns
develops  constructs  and manages  multifamily  apartment  communities  in the
southwest  southeast  midwest and western regions of the united states  as of
december 31 2000 we owned interests in and operated 145 multifamily properties
containing 51336 apartment homes located in nine states these properties had a
weighted  average  occupancy  rate of 94 for the year ended  december 31 2000
this represents the average occupancy for all our properties in 2000 weighted by
the  number of  apartment  homes in each  property  additionally  three of our
multifamily  properties  containing 1538 apartment homes were under development
at december 31 2000 we also have several sites which we intend to develop into
multifamily apartment communities

     acquisition  of oasis  residential  inc  on april 8 1998  we  acquired
through a taxfree  merger  oasis  residential  inc  a  publicly  traded las
vegasbased multifamily reit through this acquisition we acquired 52 completed
multifamily  properties and 15514  apartment  homes at the date of acquisition
each share of oasis common stock  outstanding on april 8 1998 was exchanged for
0759  of a camden  common  share  each  share  of  oasis  series a  cumulative
convertible  preferred stock  outstanding on april 8 1998 was exchanged for one
camden series a cumulative convertible preferred share with terms and conditions
comparable to the oasis  preferred  stock  we issued 124 million common shares
and 42 million  preferred  shares in exchange for the outstanding  oasis common
and preferred  stock  respectively  we assumed  approximately  484 million of
oasis debt at fair value in the merger

     in connection  with the merger with oasis on june 30 1998 we completed a
transaction in which camden usa inc one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and
tmtnevada  llc a delaware limited liability company  formed sierranevada
multifamily  investments  llc we entered into this  transaction  to reduce our
market  risk  in the  las  vegas  area  tmtnevada  holds  an 80  interest  in
sierranevada and camden usa holds the remaining 20 interest

     in the above  transaction  we  transferred to  sierranevada  19 apartment
communities  containing  5119 apartment homes for an aggregate of 248 million
prior to the  merger  oasis  owned  100 of each of these  communities  in the
merger camden usa acquired these communities as a result after the merger and
prior to the sierranevada  transaction  camden usa owned 100 of each of these
19  properties  which are located in las vegas  nevada  this  transaction  was
funded with capital invested by the members of sierranevada  the assumption of
99  million  of  existing  nonrecourse   indebtedness   the  issuance  of  17

operating strategy

     we believe  that  producing  consistent  earnings  growth  and  selectively
investing  in  favorable  markets are crucial  factors to our  success  we rely
heavily on our  sophisticated  property  management  capabilities and innovative
operating strategies in our efforts to produce consistent earnings growth

     sophisticated property management we believe the depth of our organization
enables us to deliver quality services  thereby promoting resident satisfaction
and improving resident  retention  which should reduce operating  expenses  we
manage our properties  utilizing a staff of professionals and support personnel
including  certified  property  managers  experienced  apartment  managers  and
leasing  agents  and trained  apartment  maintenance  technicians  our onsite
personnel are trained to deliver high quality  services to their  residents  we
attempt  to  motivate  our  onsite  employees  through  incentive  compensation
arrangements based upon the net operating income produced at their property  as
well as rental rate increases and the level of lease renewals achieved

page  3

     innovative operating strategies  we believe an intense focus on operations
is necessary to realize consistent sustained earnings growth ensuring resident
satisfaction  increasing  rents as market  conditions  allow  maximizing  rent
collections  maintaining  property  occupancy at optimal levels and controlling
operating  costs  comprise our  principal  strategies  to maximize  property net
operating income  lease terms are generally staggered based on vacancy exposure
by  apartment  type  so  that  lease  expirations  are  better  matched  to each
propertys  seasonal  rental  patterns  we  offer  leases  ranging  from six to
thirteen months  with individual property marketing plans structured to respond
to local market  conditions  in addition  we conduct ongoing  customer service
surveys to ensure we respond  timely to residents  changing  needs and to ensure
that residents retain a high level of satisfaction

     new development and  acquisitions  we continue to operate in markets where
we have a concentration  advantage due to economies of scale we feel that where
possible  it is best to operate  with a strong base of  properties  in order to
benefit from the personnel  allocation and the market  strength  associated with
managing  several  properties  in the  same  market  we  believe  we  are  well
positioned in our current  markets and have the  expertise to take  advantage of
both  development and  acquisition  opportunities  which have healthy  longterm
fundamentals and strong growth projections this dual capability  combined with
what we believe is a conservative financial structure  allows us to concentrate
our growth efforts towards  selective  development  alternatives and acquisition
opportunities

     selective  development  of new  apartment  properties  will  continue to be
important  to the growth of our  portfolio  for the next several  years  we use
experienced   onsite   construction   superintendents   operating   under  the
supervision  of  project  managers  and  senior   management   to  control  the
construction  process  all  development  decisions  are made from our corporate
office  risks  inherent to developing  real estate  include  zoning changes and
environmental   matters  there  is  also  the  risk  that  certain  assumptions
concerning  economic  conditions may change during the development  process  we
believe that we understand  and  effectively  manage the risks  associated  with
development  and that the  risks of new  development  are  justified  by  higher
potential yields

     properties  under  development  in our  consolidated  financial  statements
includes  1019 million related to the development of three urban land projects
located in dallas  houston and long beach  california  of this amount  472
million  relates to our two current  development  projects  the park at farmers
market  in  dallas  and the  park at  harbour  view  in long  beach  we have an
additional 223 million invested in dallas  which may be used for the proposed
future development of farmers market  phase ii and we are also in the planning
phase of forsale  townhomes  in this area  we have 324  million  invested in
additional land under  development in houston and long beach  these  properties
are in the planning phase to determine further development of apartment homes in
these areas based on demand expectations over the next three to five years we
may also sell  certain  parcels of all three  properties  to third  parties  for
commercial and retail development

     we plan to continue diversification of our investments both geographically
and in the number of apartment  homes and  selection of amenities  offered  our
operating properties have an average age of 10 years calculated on the basis of
investment dollars  we believe that the physical  improvements we have made at
our acquired  properties  such as new or enhanced  landscaping  design  new or
upgraded  amenities and redesigned  building  structures  coupled with a strong
focus on property management and marketing has resulted in attractive yields on
acquired properties

     dispositions   to  generate   consistent   earnings  growth  we  seek  to
selectively  dispose  of  properties  and  redeploy  capital if we  determine  a
property cannot meet longterm earnings growth expectations  additionally over
the next three years  we will continue  rebalancing our portfolio with the goal
of  limiting  any one  market to no more than 12 of total real  estate  assets
dispositions  during 2000 included four parcels of  undeveloped  land and eleven
properties  containing 3599 apartment  homes  for the eleven  properties sold
three were located in each of houston dallas and las vegas and one was located
in each of st louis and el paso as a result of these sales we have exited the
el paso market  reduced the number of assets in our three  largest  markets and
believe that we have  improved  the overall  quality and  geographic  mix of our
portfolio the land sales consisted of two parcels totaling 29 acres located in
downtown  dallas and one parcel  totaling 385 acres  located in houston  these
parcels of land are adjacent to our land  development  projects located in those
cities  and were sold for commercial and retail use our strategy regarding the
undeveloped  land  sales  has  been to  integrate  the  residential  and  retail
components in such a way that enhances the quality of life for our residents we

page  4

used the net proceeds from all sales during 2000  totaling 1501  million  to
reduce indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured line of credit

     environmental  matters  under  various  federal  state  and  local  laws
ordinances  and  regulations  we  are  liable  for  the  costs  of  removal  or
remediation of certain  hazardous or toxic  substances on or in our  properties
these laws often impose liability  without regard to whether we knew of or were
responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic  substances  all of our
properties  have  been  subjected  to  phase  i  site   assessments  or  similar
environmental audits to determine if there is a likelihood of contamination from
either on or offsite sources these audits have been carried out in accordance
with accepted  industry  practices  we have also conducted  limited  subsurface
investigations  and tested for radon and leadbased  paint where such procedures
have been  recommended  by our  consultants  we cannot assure you that existing
environmental  studies  reveal all  environmental  liabilities or that any prior
owner did not create any material  environmental  condition not known to us the
costs of  investigation  remediation or removal of hazardous  substances may be
substantial  if hazardous or toxic substances are present on a property  or if
we fail to properly remediate such substances  our ability to sell or rent such
property  or to borrow  using  such  property  as  collateral  may be  adversely
affected

     insurance we carry comprehensive liability fire flood extended coverage
and rental loss insurance on our properties which we believe is of the type and
amount customarily obtained on real property assets we intend to obtain similar
coverage for  properties  we acquire in the future  however  there are certain
types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature such as losses from floods
or earthquakes  that may be subject to limitations in certain areas  our board
exercises  its  discretion  in   determining   amounts   coverage   limits  and
deductibility  provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining  appropriate
insurance on our  investments at a reasonable  cost and on suitable terms if we
suffer a substantial  loss our insurance  coverage may not be sufficient to pay
the  full  current  market  value  or  current  replacement  cost  of  our  lost
investment  inflation changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental
considerations  and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance
proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed

markets and competition

     our portfolio consists of middle to upper market apartment  properties  we
target acquisitions and developments in selected highgrowth markets  since our
initial public offering in 1993 we have  diversified  into other markets in the
southwest  region and into the  southeast  midwest and  western  regions of the
united   states   by  combining   acquisition   renovation   and   development
capabilities  we believe we can better  respond to changing  conditions in each
market reduce market risk and take advantage of opportunities as they arise

     there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our properties in
attracting  residents  our properties  compete directly with other  multifamily
properties and single family homes that are available for rent in the markets in
which our properties are located our properties also compete for residents with
the new and existing  ownedhome market the demand for rental housing is driven
by economic and  demographic  trends  recent trends in the economics of renting
versus  home  ownership  indicate  an  increasing  demand for rental  housing in
certain markets due to a number of factors  including the increase in mortgage
interest  rates  rental  demand  should  be  strong  in  areas  anticipated  to
experience  inmigration  due to the younger ages that  characterize  movers as
well as the relatively high cost of home ownership in higher growth areas

     management  believes  that we  possess  the  development  capabilities  and
experience  to  provide a  continuing  source  of  portfolio  growth  in making
development decisions  management considers a number of factors  including the
size of the property  the season in which  leasing  activity will occur and the
extent to which  delivery of the  completed  apartment  homes will coincide with
leasing and  occupancy of such  apartment  homes which is dependent  upon local
market conditions  in order to pursue a development opportunity  we currently
require a minimum initial  stabilized target return of 90100  this minimum
target  return  is based on  projected  market  rents and  projected  stabilized
expenses considering the market and the nature of the prospective development

housing  amendments  act as it pertained to nine  properties  seven of which we
currently own constructed for first occupancy after march 31 1991 on february
1 1999  the justice  department  filed a lawsuit  against us and several other
defendants  in the  united  states  district  court for the  district  of nevada
alleging 1 that the design and construction of these  properties  violates the
fair  housing  act  and  2  that  we  through  the  merger  with  oasis  had
discriminated  in the rental of  dwellings to persons  because of handicap  the
complaint requests an order that i declares that the defendants  policies and
practices  violate the fair  housing  act  ii  enjoins us from a failing or
refusing to the extent possible to bring the dwelling units and public use and
common  use areas at these  properties  and other  covered  units that oasis had
designed  andor  constructed  into  compliance  with the fair  housing act b
failing  or  refusing  to take such  affirmative  steps as may be  necessary  to
restore  as nearly as possible  the alleged victims of the defendants  alleged
unlawful   practices  to  positions   they  would  have  been  in  but  for  the
discriminatory   conduct  and  c   designing  or   constructing   any  covered
multifamily  dwellings in the future that do not contain the  accessibility and
adaptability  features set forth in the fair housing act and requires us to pay
damages including punitive damages and a civil penalty

     with any  acquisition  we plan for and  undertake  renovations  needed  to
correct deferred  maintenance  lifesafety and fair housing matters on january

department  action  under  the terms of the  decree  we were  ordered  to make
certain  retrofits and implement certain  educational  programs and fair housing
advertising  these  changes  are to take  place  over the next five  years  in
